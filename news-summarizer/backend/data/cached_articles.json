            "title": "Biden\u2019s poignant farewell dwells on his fears for the country he loves",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden said his presidency would be a bridge \u2014 and it was.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t build it to a promised new Democratic generation.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s the president who stayed too long and whose administration thus arched between two terms of a nemesis he once defeated and then let back into power: Donald Trump.\n\nTo call this Biden\u2019s political tragedy would be crass. This, after all, is a man who lived unending personal anguish after burying his first wife and two of his children. But it\u2019s the fate he\u2019s been handed by history \u2014 and his own grave electoral miscalculation.\n\nThis dark reality shadowed Biden\u2019s farewell address on Wednesday night \u2014 his latest attempt to write a first draft of history about a presidency he insists is worth far more than the ignominy of a single term.\n\n\u201cMy eternal thanks to you, the American people,\u201d the president said from the Oval Office at just after 8 p.m. on the East Coast. \u201cAfter 50 years of public service, I give you my word I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation where the strengths of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure.\u201d\n\nBut by Monday afternoon, the foe who Biden warned in 2020 represented a mortal threat to America\u2019s soul will be back behind the Oval Office desk, with Biden headed into a Delaware retirement and leaving the country to face whatever happens next.\n\nWith this in mind, Biden used his address to warn of the threat he thinks Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 and what he styled as his successor\u2019s band of \u201crobber barons\u201d \u2014 represents. If anything, he appears to believe the existential peril is greater now that it was when he launched his 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cTonight, I want to warn the country of some things that give me great concern,\u201d Biden said. He cited \u201ca dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people\u201d and sounded an alarm about \u201cdangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked.\u201d\n\nLike President George Washington in his farewell address, Biden warned of storms gathering around democracy.\n\n\u201cToday, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd echoing President Dwight Eisenhower, who conjured the threat posed by the military industrial complex as he exited the White House, Biden spoke of a new age of danger posed by social media and artificial intelligence and the tech bro billionaires and millionaires who are packing Trump\u2019s incoming administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex that can pose real dangers for our country as well,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAmericans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power. The free press is crumbling \u2026 social media is giving up on fact checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.\u201d\n\nBiden was resolute and collected as he spoke, with a photo of his late son Beau, who died of brain cancer, on the table over his left shoulder. The burden of a grueling four-year presidency that is ending in his ninth decade was poignantly evident, however, in his reedy voice and the slurring of his words. If Biden is still up to the act of being president, age robbed him of the power to sell his ideas and to paint the national narrative months ago.\n\nViewers were left to wonder how Biden had ever concluded he\u2019d be fit to serve out a full second term that would have taken him to the age of 86.\n\nThe end of a career and a political era\n\nBiden was not just saying goodbye to the country Wednesday evening.\n\nHe drew down the blinds on the only adult life he\u2019s ever known \u2014 his decades as a senator, vice president and president and the unslaked ambition that sustained him through rounds of personal torment. He arrived in Washington as a young senator, already tipped as a future commander in chief, half a century ago.\n\nThen-newly elected Sen. Joe Biden is seen on November 10, 1972. WWD/Penske Media/Getty Images\n\nBack then, Mao Zedong led China, Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist and Richard Nixon worked in the office from where Biden spoke on Wednesday.\n\nSo, the 82-year-old president was closing a political era \u2014 and a link with the 20th century and a worldview that he shared with all of his modern predecessors, but one, that was built around the system of American alliances that won the Cold War.\n\nBiden was born in 1942, when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House, but will cede power at noon on Monday to a successor who seems bent on tearing down the West\u2019s geopolitical infrastructure first envisioned by FDR.\n\nOne of the ironies of Biden\u2019s long, excruciating goodbye that has unfolded since Vice President Kamala Harris lost the November election was that, on paper at least, he can lay claim to one of the more successful one-term presidencies.\n\nBiden brought the US economy back from the Covid-19 pandemic so badly managed by Trump with greater growth and job creation than all of America\u2019s top competitors. His legislative haul is more impressive than Trump\u2019s first term and the two terms of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Some would say he\u2019s the most prolific signer of consequential laws since Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s after passing big pandemic recovery bills, a rare bipartisan infrastructure measure and new laws to revive manufacturing and to create a new American semi-conductor industry. He cut the price of some prescription drugs, an achievement that was overshadowed by Trump\u2019s return when it recently went into force.\n\nHe pointed out that these bills may have significant long-term impacts that long outlast his presidency. They are the key to any potential reassessment of the Biden legacy in decades to come. All were designed by working-class Joe Biden from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to uplift the working class, which was spurned in an age of globalization and got less than most in Trump\u2019s huge first-term tax cut. The irony, however, is that the Democratic blue-collar base fell on his watch, completing Trump\u2019s transformation of the GOP and paving his way back to power.\n\nAbroad, Biden stepped into the vacuum left by Trump\u2019s first-term contempt for America\u2019s allies. He managed to save Ukraine from Russia\u2019s illegal and cruel invasion while avoiding tipping the United States into a war with a nuclear-armed rival. Presidents don\u2019t get credit in their time for catastrophes that are avoided. But this critical achievement is often ignored by hawks who complain that Biden gave Ukraine sufficient weapons to survive but not to win.\n\nIn Asia, Biden tightened US alliances and largely adopted Trump\u2019s confrontational turn toward China. But his crowing that \u201cAmerica is back\u201d after he ejected his predecessor from the White House now rings hollow among world leaders under siege from global populism who must now deal with Trump\u2019s return.\n\nA presidency rejected by the nation\n\nBiden will leave office at a point when an overwhelming majority of Americans have turned their back on his presidency.\n\nHis approval rating is matching its lowest-ever ebb, according to a new CNN/SSRS poll published Wednesday. Even fewer rate his performance positively on immigration (31%), foreign affairs (32%) or the economy (33%).\n\nIn retrospect, Biden\u2019s term foundered on four historic errors, which involved the White House telling Americans that events they could see unfolding with their own eyes were not in fact happening.\n\nThe administration never really understood the gut punch inflation inflicted upon Americans \u2014 as evidenced by the president\u2019s off-key \u201cBidenomics\u201d victory lap. The insistence that high prices were \u201ctransitory\u201d set off a slow-motion political disaster.\n\nOfficials\u2019 months of insisting there was no \u201ccrisis\u201d at the southern border also misjudged the country\u2019s mood and concern about undocumented migration, which intersected with feelings of widespread insecurity encompassing fear of crime and families\u2019 economic struggles \u2014 all of which Trump exploited.\n\nBiden insists to this day that he was right to end America\u2019s longest war in Afghanistan. But his claim to be a foreign policy expert was shattered by haunting images of refugees clinging to US planes taking off from Kabul amid the Taliban\u2019s advance and the deaths of 13 US service personal in a suicide bombing during a chaotic evacuation.\n\nBut it was Biden\u2019s insistence that he could beat Trump again that led to the painful eclipse culminating in Wednesday\u2019s farewell address. He made the decision to run despite polls that showed Americans believed he was too old and testimony of voters who consistently gave the same message.\n\nHow a disastrous debate led to Wednesday\u2019s farewell\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden debate at CNN's Atlanta studios on June 27, 2024. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nIn truth, Biden\u2019s presidency effectively ended in 10 excruciating minutes in Atlanta in June, when his advanced age and blurred mental capacity were laid bare in a CNN debate with Trump. With one devastating jab, after an incomprehensible Biden statement, the Republican nominee said what millions at home were thinking: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d\n\nClips of that encounter will be played \u2014 likely alongside a younger Ronald Reagan\u2019s dismissal of the age question \u2014 as long as televised debates take place.\n\nFuture generations won\u2019t remember the younger Biden \u2014 the wisecracking, handsome senator and politician who kept getting knocked down by life but who always got up, or the grandpa with a twinkle in his eye and an ocean of empathy in his heart whom voters chose in 2020 to restore some semblance of normality amid the pandemic. They\u2019ll see him at his most frail and ineffective. And unlike Jimmy Carter, whom Biden eulogized in one of his last acts as president, the outgoing commander in chief will not get decades to refashion the reputation of his single term.\n\nAs he closed his address, with his political energy all but exhausted, Biden was like the aged magician Prospero in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d alone on the stage when his \u201ccharms are all o\u2019erthrown.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame, may you keep the faith,\u201d Biden told the country.\n\n\u201cI love America. You love it too. God bless you all.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBest-selling fantasy author Neil Gaiman has denied allegations of sexual assault made by multiple women that were most recently reported in an article published by New York Magazine on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on his website, Gaiman said he has \u201cnever engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone\u201d and that the women\u2019s accounts contained \u201cmoments I half-recognise and moments I don\u2019t, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to Gaiman\u2019s representatives for further comment.\n\nGaiman, whose nearly 50 books include works that have been adapted for TV and film, such as \u201cGood Omens,\u201d \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman,\u201d was first accused of sexual assault by two women in a podcast investigation produced by Tortoise Media in July.\n\nBy August, Tortoise reported that additional women had come forward with their own allegations of sexual assault, coercion, or abuse against the author. Four of the women who spoke with Tortoise also spoke with New York Magazine. CNN has not independently verified their allegations, which span from 1986 to 2022 in the US, UK or New Zealand.\n\nWithout responding to each individual allegation, Gaiman said \u201cas I re-review everything that actually happened as opposed to what is being alleged \u2013 I don\u2019t accept there was any abuse. To repeat, I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from what actually took place that they bear no relationship to reality,\u201d Gaimain wrote \u201cI am prepared to take responsibility for any missteps I made. I\u2019m not willing to turn my back on the truth, and I can\u2019t accept being described as someone I am not, and cannot and will not admit to doing things I didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Neil Gaiman's books have been adapted into TV series and movies. Mike Marsland/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nSince the allegations against Gaiman surfaced in July, several of his TV and film projects remain ongoing. Prime Video\u2019s \u201cGood Omens\u201d will conclude with a 90-minute special instead of a full third season as originally planned and Gaiman will no longer receive an executive producer credit, according to Variety. The company hasn\u2019t issued a public update about the status of another Gaiman project, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d CNN has reached out to Prime Video for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney has paused its adaptation of \u201cThe Graveyard Book\u201d due to multiple factors, including the allegations, IndieWire reported in September. CNN has contacted Disney for comment.\n\nAt Netflix, the second season of \u201cThe Sandman,\u201d which is produced by subsidiaries of CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, is expected to air later this year. A spokesperson for Netflix was not immediately available for comment.",

            "title": "What\u2019s in the Hamas-Israel ceasefire and hostage release deal",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe first phase of the deal reached between Hamas and Israel on Wednesday includes a pause in the war and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody.\n\nBut several details and the timeline of the full deal remain unclear and will be key to its success moving forward.\n\nThe deal represents the second ceasefire since the war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched an attack into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The military offensive launched by Israel in response has killed at least 46,645 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nThe first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week. In that period, 105 hostages being held by Hamas \u2013 primarily women, children and elderly people \u2013 were released, while Israel released about 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\n\nThe current ceasefire deal is set up to progress in three distinct phases.\n\nPhase one is expected to start at some point Sunday and last for six weeks. This phase will feature a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli troops, a swap of hostages and prisoners, and an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza. US hostages held in Gaza will be released in that first phase, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.\n\nThe second and third phases are less developed, and the details will be decided during the first phase, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a briefing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to do everything we can, everything possible together with our partners, to ensure that this deal is implemented as it\u2019s agreed,\u201d he said, noting that mediators had spent 411 days working on the agreement terms. \u201cAnd this deal will bring us peace, hopefully, at the end of it. I believe that it all depends on the parties of the agreement acting in good faith in that agreement in order to ensure that no collapse happens to that deal.\u201d\n\nHamas hailed the deal on Wednesday as a \u201ccrucial turning point.\u201d Israel\u2019s cabinet must still vote to approve the deal before it goes into effect.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what\u2019s in the current ceasefire deal and the steps ahead.\n\nSupporters of Israeli hostages react to news on the Gaza ceasefire negotiations in Tel Aviv, Israel, January 15, 2025. Ronen Zvulun/Reuters\n\nCeasefire, Israeli withdrawal and aid\n\nThe ceasefire deal would deliver the first reprieve from war for the people of Gaza in more than a year, and only the second since the Israeli bombardment began.\n\nThe Israeli military would begin withdrawing from population centers during the first phase, but would remain along the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, an Israeli official said Wednesday. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the size of which has been one of the final sticking points in the negotiations.\n\nThe deal is expected to allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes across Gaza, including in the devastated north. There would be a massive influx of humanitarian aid into the strip, where residents have long faced dire humanitarian conditions, Al Thani said.\n\nGaza\u2019s wounded will also be allowed to leave the enclave to receive treatment, while aid will be allowed into the strip with hospitals and bakeries undergoing repairs, he said.\n\nWhich hostages and prisoners will be released?\n\nAs part of that first phase, Hamas and its allied militant groups will release 33 hostages in the first phase, including female soldiers, children, the elderly and the sick, Al Thani said.\n\nUnder the deal, American hostages being held by Hamas \u201cwill be part of that hostage release on phase one,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThree female Israeli civilian hostages are expected to be released on the first day of the ceasefire and then on the seventh day, Hamas is set to release four more, according to a document shared by senior Hamas official Bassem Naim.\n\nFollowing that, \u201cHamas will release three Israeli detainees every seven days, starting with women (civilians and soldiers),\u201d the document states.\n\n\u201cDuring the sixth week, Hamas will release all remaining detainees included in this stage, and in return, Israel will release the agreed upon number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons, based on lists provided by Hamas,\u201d the document continues.\n\nAccording to the document, Israel will release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were arrested on October 8, 2023, but were not involved in Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel the day before. Of the 33 hostages Hamas is expected to release, nine who are ill and injured will be exchanged for 110 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, according to the document.\n\nHamas and its allies hold 94 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. Of those, at least 34 are dead, according to the Israeli government, though the true number is expected to be higher. Eighty-one of the hostages are men and 13 are women. Eighty-four are from Israel, while eight are from Thailand, one is from Nepal, and one is from Tanzania.\n\nHamas holds an additional four hostages held captive since 2014, at least two of whom are dead.\n\nIsrael holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society \u2013 though that number does not include an unknown number of Palestinians taken captive in Gaza. The figure of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel includes 3,376 people held under administrative detention, meaning they have neither had public charges against them nor faced trial, including 95 children and 22 women.\n\nSecond and third phases to be negotiated\n\nThe second and third phases of the ceasefire still have to be negotiated during the first. Those negotiations will begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to an Israeli official.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at the White House about a ceasefire deal in Gaza on Wednesday, Jan. 15. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nThe ceasefire is not guaranteed to continue beyond the first phase of the deal. However, the official said Israel is eager to \u201cbring all our hostages back home,\u201d and will enter negotiations for the second phase in good faith, which could lead to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nBiden said the second and third phases will include a release of further hostages and the beginning of Gaza\u2019s rebuild.\n\n\u201cWhen phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza, and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, under phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families, and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin.\u201d\n\nHow the deal will be enforced\n\nIn response to a question from CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson, Al Thani said the US, Egypt and Qatar have put a mechanism in place to ensure neither side breaks the ceasefire.\n\n\u201cIt will be placed in Cairo, and this follow-up actually will be a joint team from the three countries that will monitor the implementation of the agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything has been agreed upon and will be in place, hopefully, on the day of the execution.\u201d\n\nAl Thani said this ceasefire deal was different from the one in November 2023 that lasted just a week.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the agreement in November was very transactional. So it was like a day-by-day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this agreement has a clear mechanism for the first 42 days, and there is a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three, and all the details of the agreements will be published in the next couple of days once the details are finalized.\u201d",

            "title": "TikTok ban: Trump is considering a plan to save popular video app",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is weighing a plan that could delay America\u2019s TikTok ban, giving the new administration more time to potentially cut a deal with a US buyer to save the super-popular video app, sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nThe potential executive order, which was first reported by The Washington Post, would strive to allow TikTok\u2019s 170 million American users to continue to use the app for a certain period of time as the administration sorts out who could potentially buy it.\n\nTrump, who supported a TikTok ban as president, has recently said he wants to keep the app alive \u2013 even posting a TikTok video in June in which he said he wanted to \u201csave TikTok.\u201d Last month, he asked the Supreme Court to stay the law so his incoming administration could work out a deal to keep TikTok available to Americans.\n\nStill, Trump may ultimately decline to act. As the deadline draws closer, Trump \u2013 who\u2019s never shied away from overt suggestions for the executive and judicial branches \u2013 has otherwise sat this one out.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance, its China-based owner, have less than 4 days left before the app is banned in the United States \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t sell itself to an American buyer.\n\nTikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app.\n\nThe ban would take effect Sunday, pending a Supreme Court decision that is expected to come soon. America\u2019s highest court, however, appears poised to keep the law that bans TikTok in place.\n\nBecause the ban would take place a day before Trump takes office, an executive order on January 20 wouldn\u2019t even be an 11th-hour attempt to save TikTok \u2013 it would have already been banned at that point.\n\nThe Biden possibility\n\nThat is, unless President Joe Biden takes action first.\n\nSome lawmakers have urged Biden to delay the ban before it takes effect. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul wrote to Biden in December, urging him to exercise an extension under the Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, which provides the legal basis for banning TikTok and other foreign-owned apps deemed a national security threat.\n\n\u201cThe stakes here are high: As a practical matter, even if the Court rules that the law is constitutional by the January deadline, ByteDance cannot divest TikTok in that limited time,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter, sent December 19.\n\nThe law provides the president the authority to impose a one-time extension of up to 90 days. But triggering the extension requires Biden to prove to Congress that parties working on purchasing TikTok have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal. Given ByteDance\u2019s adamance that the company is not for sale, that evidence would seem to be nonexistent.\n\nSo it appears unlikely Biden could step in \u2013 even if he wanted to slow-roll the bill he signed after it was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nTikTok\u2019s uncertain future\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order would be another climb in a rollercoaster ride for an app that appears ready to shut its lights off Sunday and \u201cgo dark,\u201d as the company\u2019s lawyer, Noel Francisco, told the Supreme Court Friday. TikTok has fought the ban for years. But Reuters and The Information reported Wednesday the app is preparing to shut itself down entirely Sunday, giving its users the option to collect their data while restricting access to videos.\n\nTikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app.\n\nBut even if TikTok shuts itself down Sunday, that doesn\u2019t mean it would go dark forever. It could ultimately sell itself to an American buyer down the road, which would presumably turn TikTok back on for American users.\n\nAnother option: TikTok could do nothing on Sunday, hoping that Trump\u2019s potential executive order would give it the ability to remain online. The law doesn\u2019t really force TikTok to do anything at all. It\u2019s on the US-based companies that support TikTok to take action.\n\nSo, on Sunday, a very real possibility is that people won\u2019t notice much of a change at all. Apple and Google probably will remove the app\u2019s listing from their app stores, but people who have already downloaded the app could continue to use it if TikTok does nothing.\n\nThe enforcement mechanism for the new law would be the US Justice Department, which is changing hands at noon the day after the ban and which would have wide discretion to enforce the law (or not). So if Trump\u2019s executive order says his administration won\u2019t enforce the ban, TikTok may place a bet that all of the companies that host and support TikTok\u2019s content will be willing to break the letter of the law with the understanding that they won\u2019t be punished for it.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not a long-term viable option, however: No one would be able to access the app if they got a new phone or never downloaded the app in the first place, for example. And it would become illegal for companies like Oracle that host TikTok\u2019s content in the United States to continue to serve it to the app\u2019s users. That could force TikTok to serve content from outside the US, degrading service.\n\nThe possibility of a sale\n\nThat\u2019s why a sale may be the only way TikTok ultimately remains available for American users.\n\nByteDance has long been adamant that it has no intention of selling itself. TikTok\u2019s magical algorithm that keeps you hooked on the app is its secret power, and putting a price tag on such a valuable commodity, envied by every other social media app, is difficult. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users\u2019 content. Yet Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that China is weighing a sale \u2014 to Elon Musk.\n\nMusk may have the resources to buy the app, and he\u2019s a major Trump supporter and about to take a quasi-role in his government. Other candidates, including \u201cShark Tank\u2019s\u201d Kevin O\u2019Leary and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, have also made an offer for TikTok.\n\nO\u2019Leary and McCourt\u2019s bid, valuing the app at roughly $20 billion, is partly crowdfunded from the public. But it would not include an acquisition of the app\u2019s algorithm, the key to its success and also US officials\u2019 biggest security concern. O\u2019Leary tells CNN the offer has been disseminated to interested parties, but it remains unclear whether the company will choose to engage.\n\n\u201cBoth administrations have seen the offer and have access to it, as do all American shareholders of ByteDance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in an interview. \u201cAnd we have made sure ByteDance itself has it in its possession.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week to discuss the outlook for the app.\n\nIf ByteDance chooses to engage, Trump could perhaps argue that significant progress has been made on a deal and delay the ban.\n\nA Trump executive order would be only a step in the process to keep TikTok online \u2013 not the be-all and end-all for the app. But it might keep the lights on just a little longer.\n\nCNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed reporting.",

Alex G Perez/AGPfoto/Sipa USA\n\nBlue Origin took its time sharing information about why the company called off its first attempt to get New Glenn of the ground Monday.\n\nThe company initially said only that engineers were troubleshooting issues with one of the rocket\u2019s \u201csubsystems.\u201d\n\nBut in a tweet posted Monday evening, more than 12 hours after the launch window closed, the company divulged in a social media post that the delay \u201cwas due to ice forming in a purge line\u201d \u2014 which is a pipe or tube that funnels unwanted gases or debris away from critical hardware \u2014 \u201con an auxiliary power unit that powers some of our hydraulic systems.\u201d\n\nBefore Blue Origin waved off a Monday morning launch, the pre-launch webcast was punctuated by a dizzying series of clock resets that kept adding time back onto the countdown ticker.\n\nLittle insight was given into what was happening behind the scenes. And unlike many other rocket companies, Blue Origin did not share audio from launch controlers that may have offered clues as to what engineers were grappling with.\n\nMaggie McNeece, one of the cohosts on the company\u2019s webcast of the event, shared only this context on why the countdown clock kept resetting.\n\n\u201cThe team is continuing to work through a few anomalies before we can proceed into terminal count,\u201d she said on the livestream. \u201cAnomaly\u201d is aerospace parlance for a data point or problem that is outside of what was expected.\n\nIn concluding the Monday webcast, Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin\u2019s vice president of in-space systems, said only that the company would work to drain the New Glenn rocket of its fuel.",

Along with these two companies, Airbnb is partnering with 211 LA, a community hub for Los Angeles County, to coordinate the distribution of emergency housing for individuals displaced by the wildfires.\n\nThe Hotel Association of Los Angeles (HALA) and Santa Monica Travel & Tourism have compiled lists of available hotels in Southern California to assist nearly 180,000 residents included in evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by the destruction of the fires raging across the Los Angeles region.

            "text": "Tel Aviv, Israel CNN \u2014\n\nAs Israel and Hamas edge closer to a possible ceasefire-hostage agreement, a small number of families whose loved ones remain captive in Gaza are saying \u201cNo\u201d to a deal.\n\nMany members of the Tikva (Hope) Forum fringe group, including settlers in the occupied West Bank, hold right-wing ideologies. They oppose the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel as part of the deal, arguing that a partial release of Israeli hostages from Gaza is unacceptable. Instead, they insist that defeating Hamas through strong military action should be the top priority, and is the best strategy to retrieve hostages.\n\nThe Tikva Forum, which says it was founded to bring the hostages home \u201cfrom a place of strength, faith, national responsibility and concern for the unity and security of all Israelis,\u201d is distinct from the Hostage Families Forum \u2013 which represents the majority of the hostage families, and has been leading protests advocating for a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nTzvika Mor, Tikva Forum\u2019s co-founder, believes his son Eitan, who is being held in Gaza, would want him to oppose the deal.\n\n\u201cThis deal that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu is talking about today is very dangerous for my son and for most of the hostages, especially the young men and the soldiers that will stay in Gaza for decades,\u201d Mor told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI know definitely that Eitan wants me to make sure that the State of Israel will be safe,\u201d he said, adding that if his son was not in captivity, he would have been \u201ca soldier in Gaza or Lebanon or Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli government expects that an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza will be announced later Wednesday or Thursday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe first phase of the deal is expected to see the release of children, women, the sick and the elderly who are held in Gaza for the freeing of hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails, some of whom were accused of killing Israelis.\n\nBoaz Miran, who is also part of the Tikva Forum, also opposes the deal. His brother Omri was kidnapped by Hamas-led militants on October 7, 2023 from Kibbutz Nahal Oz in southern Israel, leaving behind his wife, Lishay, their two young daughters. The first phase of the deal is unlikely to see his brother released, given that it prioritizes women, children and the elderly.\n\nNaama Miran, sister of Omri Miran, an Israeli hostage held by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, is consoled by their father, Dani Miran, during a press conference after meeting with Pope Francis, in Rome, Italy on April 8, 2024. Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters\n\nBoaz has campaigned against the deal along with other families attached to the Tikva Forum. Members of the group often share views similar to those of Israel\u2019s far-right politicians, who also oppose the deal, such as National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if a deal is signed, and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said a deal would be a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d\n\nBoth ministers are settlers with hardline views about Palestinians.\n\n\u2018Monsters as our neighbors\u2019\n\nMor, the co-founder for the forum, resides in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron in the occupied West Bank. His son was kidnapped by Palestinian militants from the Nova Festival on October 7. He said that at least 15 families are part of the forum, but that many prefer to stay out of the limelight.\n\nMiran and other members of the Tikva forum reject the Gaza deal in its current form, saying that hostages should come back in one wave, and that Palestinian \u201cterrorists\u201d should not be freed. \u201cWe believe all the captives should be returned in one deal, from a position of strength,\u201d Miran said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m against this current deal because, first of all, it won\u2019t bring back all the captives. It\u2019ll be a partial release, the rest will probably be neglected,\u201d Miran told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nHe also believes that the release of Palestinian prisoners would be catastrophic for Israel.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have these monsters as our neighbors on the other side of the border. Sinwar was released as part of the (Gilad) Shalit deal (when the Israeli soldier was traded for over 1,000 prisoners in 2011), and look at what he did to us,\u201d he told CNN, referring to Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attack, who was killed by Israel last year. \u201cWe can\u2019t agree to a situation where the released prisoners will murder our people in the future.\u201d\n\nIsrael holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society, including 3,376 people who have been held under administrative detention \u2013 a controversial procedure that allows Israeli authorities to hold people indefinitely on security grounds without trial or charge, sometimes based on evidence that isn\u2019t made public. Ninety-five children are currently under administrative detention, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society.\n\nThe proposed deal is set to be implemented in three phases, the first of which would last 42 days. In the first phase, 33 hostages held by Hamas and its allies since October 7 will be released, including women, children, men over the age of 50 and wounded people. Israel would release \u201cmany hundreds\u201d of Palestinian prisoners in exchange, an Israeli official said, including Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.\n\nNegotiations to reach the second and third phases of a ceasefire agreement \u2013 which is intended to end the war \u2013 would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to the Israeli official.\n\nMiran said that while he celebrates the release of each hostage, the deal as it stands would mean that the joy of some families would mean sadness for others, adding that \u201cthis deal will determine the fate of my brother Omri to rot in the tunnels of Hamas for months or even years to come.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli government believes 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza \u2013 most of whom were abducted on October 7, 2023, dozens of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has raged for 15 months, turning Gaza into a wasteland and displacing at least 90% of Palestinians since October 2023, according to the United Nations. More than 46,000 people have been killed \u2013 mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",

            "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Qatar\u2019s prime minister emerged Wednesday to declare \u2014 at long last \u2014 that a ceasefire-for-hostage deal had been struck in Gaza, representatives for two American administrations were on hand in Doha to bask in the victory.\n\nThe cooperation between the two was \u201calmost unprecedented,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said after the deal was clinched, made possible by a rare intersection of interests between bitter rivals who both saw an opening following Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nBrett McGurk, the longtime Middle East negotiator for President Joe Biden, had been planted in the Qatari capital for weeks in the hopes of a final agreement. He was joined in recent days by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for the final push.\n\nAt points, McGurk and Witkoff divvied up meetings across the Middle East to push the deal across the line, including critical talks between Witkoff and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that McGurk joined by phone. If McGurk was focused primarily on the parameters of the deal, Witkoff was on hand to emphasize Trump\u2019s desire to see a deal finished by Inauguration Day.\n\nAfter the agreement was announced, both the incoming and outgoing president took full credit, a sign the poisonous relationship between them endures.\n\nUltimately, however, the deal enables both Biden and Trump to claim victory. It notches a final bit of positive news for a president who is poised to leave office with the lowest approval rating of his term. And it bolsters the bonafides of a president-elect who vowed \u201call hell would break out\u201d in Gaza if the hostages were not released before his second inauguration.\n\nThe reality of who is responsible for the deal is complex. Biden administration officials say momentum toward a deal began before the election, after a separate ceasefire was struck between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The contours of the final agreement with Hamas map closely with a proposal Biden first unveiled in May, but was unable to complete.\n\nSpeaking at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month, Witkoff said Biden\u2019s team was the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d in the talks.\n\n\u201cNo one has pride of authorship. We are totally outcome oriented. Let\u2019s get them home,\u201d Witkoff, a former real estate investor, said then.\n\nStill, after the deal was struck, even Biden officials acknowledged the deadline of Trump\u2019s entry into office was a motivating factor in finally finding success after months of failure. And Trump, who was monitoring developments from Florida, was quick to declare the agreement was only made possible by his win.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\nBiden was more circumspect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good afternoon,\u201d Biden said Wednesday from the White House Cross Hall, steps from where members of the incoming Trump team were meeting with their Biden administration counterparts in the West Wing to discuss national security matters.\n\nThe president, who has decades of high-level foreign policy experience, described the talks that led to the ceasefire deal as \u201cone of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d He said his team had been \u201cspeaking as one\u201d with Trump officials.\n\nBut asked as he was stepping away from the podium who deserves credit for Wednesday\u2019s deal \u2013 himself or Trump \u2013 the president flashed his annoyance:\n\n\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d he said before walking away.\n\nMonths of talks starting, stopping\n\nBy the final stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign, few inside the White House believed a hostage deal could be achieved before the results of the election were known.\n\nAmerican and European officials saw Netanyahu as biding his time, waiting to see which US president he\u2019d be dealing with going forward \u2013 and keeping his options open for any outcome.\n\nHours of angry phone calls between the White House and Netanyahu\u2019s office had yielded little progress, and even the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar did not immediately shake loose a deal.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory \u2013 widely seen inside the White House as Netanyahu\u2019s preferred result \u2013 was hardly the outcome any Biden\u2019s aides were hoping for. In their loss, though, some saw a fresh opportunity.\n\nSo during a post-election meeting with Trump in front of a roaring Oval Office fire, Biden had a request for the man who\u2019d be replacing him in a few months: Work with the administration\u2019s team to get the hostages out of Gaza.\n\nIn conversations between the incoming and outgoing national security teams, Biden\u2019s aides made clear that whatever acrimony existed between the two men \u2013 and despite their friendly chat in the Oval Office, they remained bitterly opposed \u2013 the issue of the hostages was a place they must work together.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re prepared to work with the incoming team in common cause on a bipartisan basis to do everything in our collective American power to secure the release of the hostages, both living and deceased,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the week after the November election.\n\nA mutually beneficial agreement\n\nIn their fireside conversation, Biden and Trump came to an agreement that the hostage matter could and should be resolved before the hand-off of power on January 20, according to people who heard about the meeting afterward.\n\nThe timing suited both men.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers have long felt that any agreement struck after his victory, but prior to him taking office, would enable him to take credit for it. It would also take the issue off his plate as he begins a second presidency squarely focused on fulfilling his campaign pledges on immigration, tariffs and dismantling Biden-era regulations.\n\nFor Biden, having finally secured the hostage deal he\u2019s spent more than a quarter of his presidency trying to cement would validate time and energy \u2013 and political capital \u2013 lost to the cause.\n\nAnd so, with both men\u2019s blessing, the two opposing sides set to work on a final, last-week push to achieve what had for so long seemed impossible.\n\nLate nights and final demands\n\nA critical sticking point that had emerged over the past several months was Hamas\u2019 refusal to acknowledge how many hostages it was still holding, or to identify which hostages it would release as part of the first phase of the deal, according to the senior administration official.\n\nAmerican officials made clear to Hamas through its intermediaries that no agreement could be realized without a full list of hostages that would be released as part of the deal.\n\nThe pressure appeared to work. By late December, Hamas had agreed to provide the list, accelerating talks to reach the final-stage negotiations toward a deal.\n\nMcGurk remained in the Middle East working toward completing the complex agreement, including finalizing details on the sequencing of how and when prisoners would be released.\n\nHoled up inside a building in Doha, negotiators from the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, along with Hamas officials, talked until 3 a.m. as the sides attempted to finalize what had been a frustratingly elusive deal to end the conflict.\n\nHamas raised a number of last minute demands during the final negotiations. But the American and Israeli sides held firm as they pushed Hamas to agree.\n\nImplementation of the deal could begin as early as Sunday, an official said.\n\nAs the reality of the deal sank in, Netanyahu got on the phone with his American counterparts. His first call was to Trump, to thank him and arrange a meeting in Washington. Next, he called Biden and \u201cthanked him as well,\u201d according to a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn idyllic settings around India\u2019s coastal southwestern state of Kerala, photographer Keerthana Kunnath has been capturing images of muscular women flexing their heroic forms. Amid foaming waves, palm fronds or rocky outcrops the women curl biceps, tense quads or exaggerate shoulders, exchanging gym clothes for a gauzy olive dress or feminine checkered bikini top and skirt.\n\nBut in Kerala, where the London-based photographer is from, bodybuilding is still taboo for women, who are typically expected to adhere to traditional, feminine norms. After stumbling upon one competitor\u2019s Instagram account, Kunnath became fascinated by the female bodybuilders who have dedicated their time to the sport and defied societal conventions \u2014 and often their family\u2019s wishes, too.\n\n\u201cWhere we are, it\u2019s not a very common thing,\u201d she explained in a phone call to CNN. \u201cI would barely call it a \u2018community\u2019 because it\u2019s still fairly new, and there\u2019s only a very handful of girls who are into it.\u201d\n\nBhumika Kumar, 22, said her pursuit of the sport has put her at odds with family members, though she has persisted to win local titles and now also coaches aspiring bodybuilders. Keerthana Kunnath\n\nAcross India, a growing number of female competitors in the sport have achieved professional status with its governing body, the International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation \u2014 but only in recent years. Deepika Chowdury, a former molecular biologist, became the first Indian woman to do so in 2016.\n\nInitially interested in researching the gender-neutral martial art Kalaripayattu, which originated in Kerala, Kunnath shifted her focus after finding that the women focused on bulking instead. The bodybuilders she photographed \u2014 part of her series \u201cNot What You Saw\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t know each other well, but were aware of one another through social media and competitions.\n\n\u201cEvery time I connected with each person, and I told them I\u2019m going to photograph that person before you, they would be like, \u2018Oh my god, I know her \u2014 her body is stunning. Her thighs are crazy,\u2019\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cIt felt like mutual admiration between all of them.\u201d\n\nDedication to the sport\n\nFor Bhumika Kumar, who is 22 years old and lives in the Kerala city of Kochi, training for bodybuilding competitions has fulfilled a lifelong desire to become an athlete \u2014 a dream she hadn\u2019t been allowed to pursue as a child, she told CNN via WhatsApp. Now a gold-medalist in local competitions like Miss Kerala and Miss Ernakulam, she has transformed herself following what she described as an inactive childhood.\n\n\u201cMy parents wouldn\u2019t let me go out and play with other kids. Hence, I was not a very physically active kid during my school days. I was always low in stamina and strength,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSandra A S, 25, has been training for four years. She told CNN her parents began supporting her after her first competition. Keerthana Kunnath\n\nShe sees potential in female bodybuilders around India to represent their country on the world stage, but says it\u2019s difficult for them to receive support. Keerthana Kunnath\n\nAs an adult, she found her gateway to exercise through workout videos on YouTube and joined a gym \u201cafter lots of fights with family,\u201d she said. She felt drawn to competing professionally but also divided on whether to pursue it until a year ago. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about stepping onstage,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I finally decided to go for it and met my coach.\u201d\n\nKumar isn\u2019t the only woman in the series whose relatives felt entitled to get involved with their personal choices. Kunnath spoke extensively with each of her subjects by phone before meeting them in person to better understand their journeys.\n\n\u201cA lot of them had pressure from their family and extended relatives: \u2018How are you letting your daughter go into this space where they\u2019re working on their muscles? They\u2019re showing off their bodies,\u2019\u201d she said, recalling the kinds of comments her subjects had heard.\n\nHeroic portraits\n\nKerala\u2019s female bodybuilders are entering a high-pressure, male-dominated sport requiring daily commitment under coaches primarily used to training men. One of Kunnath\u2019s subjects, 25-year-old Sandra A S, has been training for four years and now coaches aspiring bodybuilders, too. She hopes to break barriers for women competitors by winning a qualification card to compete professionally on the international stage.\n\nAs Kunnath visualized the series, she turned to the iconography of Indian goddesses that she encountered during childhood. \u201cI still remember having these posters of goddesses in front of these serene backgrounds,\u201d she recalled. Working with a local stylist, Elton John, Kunnath pursued non-sexualized, heroic portraits with muted pastels and flowing fabrics, departing from gym clothes or the punchy, colorful bathing suits and direct lighting of the bodybuilding stage.\n\nBodybuilder Aisha Nidha poses for Kunnath, who found mutual admiration between the women she photographed, even though they often only knew of each other through competitions. Keerthana Kunnath\n\n\u201cThey are these extremely muscular, strong, confident girls\u2026 but still, they still have this softness to them,\u201d Kunnath said. The photographer found the more a bodybuilder bulks, the more she is treated as a \u201creally strong, intimidating character,\u201d but that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nSince beginning the series, Kunnath has also made a point of supporting her subjects by attending their competitions and taking their professional headshots to a \u201cthank you\u201d for being part of the work.\n\n\u201cThey had to carve this space for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like those stories should be celebrated.\u201d",

That\u2019s a sign for you that systemic racism is not something you can deal with lightly, it\u2019s so deep inserted into so many things that we do across the board.\u201d\n\nDjimon Hounsou at the album release party for Netflix's \"Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver\" in Queens, New York, April 2024. John Nacion/Getty Images\n\nThese harsh truths were the catalyst for his philanthropic mission.\n\nThe actor launched the Djimon Hounsou Foundation in 2019, an initiative dedicated to bridging the Black diaspora and combating modern-day slavery. However, the core of Hounsou\u2019s work centers around reconnecting Black people to their African roots.\n\nHe approaches that work through Africa Reconnect, a series of music and cultural events currently held in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nLast September, CNN attended Hounsou\u2019s third annual Run Richmond 16-19 event in a town that was once a central hub of the transatlantic slave trade in the Upper South of the US.\n\nHounsou set the tone for the weekend with a kickoff event called \u201cA Time to Heal,\u201d held in the Shockoe Bottom area, once the site of America\u2019s second-largest slave market.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How 'Amistad' sparked Djimon Hounsou's mission to unite the Black diaspora 03:11 - Source: CNN\n\nThe evening started with a ceremony honoring ancestors, inspired by the traditions of West Africa\u2019s Yoruba people, with attendees immersed in various meditative practices, including guided meditation, breathwork and shamanic drumming. \u201cI want this to be a cathartic experience for our people to release grief and so that we can heal and reconcile,\u201d said Hounsou.\n\nHe acknowledged that the event, held at a site with such a traumatic history, could open painful wounds, \u201cBut by opening those wounds and acknowledging what once took place here, you are engaging a form of healing,\u201d the 60-year-old actor said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to achieve, healing of the intergenerational trauma of our [Black] people.\u201d\n\nReconciliation and reconnection\n\nApproximately 2,000 people gathered at Kanawha Plaza in downtown Richmond on September 21 to take on either a 16.19 kilometer or 6.19 kilometer cultural run or walk that took them through 400 years of Black history. The distance is a reference to the year 1619, when a ship first carried enslaved Africans to the shores of Virginia.\n\nWhen asked why he chose a physical activity to bring people together, Hounsou said, \u201cThere are only very few things that allow you to massively bring people of all races together, which are sports and music.\u201d\n\nAlong the route, race participants could engage with a mobile app developed in partnership with the 400 Years of African American History Commission, and narrated by Hounsou, which provided educational information and context about the sites that runners passed during their journey.\n\nHounsou has plans to expand the event to Liverpool and Ouidah, Benin, over the next few years as a symbolic representation of the triangular route of the Transatlantic slave trade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to reverse that triangle to be a triangle of hope,\u201d said Hounsou. \u201cI\u2019m trying to champion the idea that we all from every part of the world have a specific place where we come to honor our ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe Djimon Hounsou Foundation is also sponsoring carefully curated 14-day trips to the continent designed to showcase multiple countries, to deepen people\u2019s understanding of their heritage and identity.\n\n\u201cI came to California with this compelling need to do something for my continent and my people and to champion this idea of reconciliation and reconnection with the motherland,\u201d Hounsou said.\n\n\u201cI just hope that I have changed the narrative about our people and our continent.\u201d",

            "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nPygmy seahorses, about the size of a fingernail, are some of the smallest vertebrates in the world. First discovered in 1969, little was known about the creatures. But in the early 2000s, British marine biologist Richard Smith decided to focus his PhD research on Denise\u2019s pygmy seahorse, a species found in Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was then that he made an extraordinary discovery.\n\nSeahorses are renowned for mating for life, with the male carrying the eggs. But after following three male pygmies and one female for weeks, Smith discovered that the sex lives of the smaller variety can be much more colorful.\n\nAfter flirting with one male, the female would impregnate him, before he went off to brood the eggs for 12 days. Around six days later, another male would come along and she would impregnate him too. The third male, who never got the chance to mate with the female, took to attacking his more successful rivals, attempting to strangle them with his tail.\n\nThis story and others are collated in Smith\u2019s book \u201cThe World Beneath: The Life and Times of Unknown Sea Creatures and Coral Reefs,\u201d published in November in the US and January in the UK. It showcases the ocean\u2019s little-known creatures with more than 300 images taken during Smith\u2019s research dives in over 23 countries.\n\nRichard Smith has taken photographs of underwater life all over the world, including this vibrant coral reef in Raja Ampat, West Papua, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nThere are photographs of flasher wrasses, which Smith calls the \u201cpeacocks of the sea\u201d for seducing the females with their kaleidoscope of color. There is the Banggai cardinal fish, found only in Indonesia, which keeps its eggs and newly hatched babies in its mouth for two weeks. Then, there are gruesome parasites, his latest obsession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked weird and wonderful creatures, whether it\u2019s on land or underwater,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut underwater, so little is known about so much.\u201d\n\nPatience is key\n\nSurprisingly, photography came as something of an afterthought to Smith. He started capturing images purely to aid scientific identification and to demonstrate the scale of some of the tiny species he was studying. Gradually, he realized the power of communicating species\u2019 behavior through images and raising awareness of the increasing threats marine fauna face.\n\n\u201cI started to realize that if I wanted to communicate the stories of animals in danger, a beautiful image makes a huge difference,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring his PhD, after locating the group of four pygmies living in gorgonian (sea fan) corals in Sulawesi, Smith would spend four or five hours a day diving and observing their reproductive and social behavior. \u201cI would study them from dawn until dusk,\u201d he says fondly, and he gave them names: Josephine was the heroine, and her male suitors were called Tom, Dick and Harry.\n\nA heavily pregnant male Denise's pygmy seahorse is photographed on his way to give birth, in Wakatobi, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\n\u201cI think anthropomorphism has a really useful role in people relating to animals and their behaviors. The pygmy seahorse is so tiny, yet it has this elaborate social behavior,\u201d he says.\n\nSmith photographed them using a digital SLR camera with a macro lens inside waterproof housing. \u201cYou have to have a lot of patience,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m keen not to disturb the animals for photos, so I would never poke it or move it to a better background or anything. I just wait and watch.\u201d\n\nHe was the first to document an example of polygamy in the seahorse family, and the imagery showed the process in minute detail, even capturing the stretch marks around the belly of the male pygmy once it had released its offspring.\n\nMore recently, the object of his fascination has turned to parasites. It\u2019s the stuff of horror films: Smith recalls one that lives in the nostril of a crocodile fish. Another attacks the anemonefish (also known as the clownfish, featured in the animated movie \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d), climbing through its gill arch as a tiny larva and then settling in the mouth, eating away its tongue, and staring out ominously with two black specks for eyes.\n\nAn anemonefish with a tongue-biter isopod parasite peering out of its mouth, in Lembeh Strait, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nThen there\u2019s a parasitoid worm that Smith photographed curled inside a shrimp, like spaghetti: \u201cIt starts off infecting the shrimp and then it grows, eating the least important organs to start with, until it eventually becomes a zombie shrimp that just feeds and fuels the growth of the parasite,\u201d he explains. \u201cUltimately, the parasite will explode out and infect others and kill the host, making it a parasitoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cA beacon of positivity\u201d\n\nSmith is intent on uncovering behaviors never seen before, whether brutal or awe-inspiring. He believes that gathering new information on these little-known species can help build an understanding of ocean ecosystems and ultimately aid their conservation.\n\nHe is the focal lead for pygmy seahorses for the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world\u2019s most comprehensive information source on the extinction risk status of plant and animal species. Recently, he led the assessment of the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, which was listed as the first critically endangered seahorse.\n\nWalea pygmies, along with many other marine species, are threatened by destructive fishing practices and temperature extremes caused by climate change. Coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent and widespread, causing whole ecosystems to collapse.\n\nWalea Soft Coral Pygmy Seahorse (Hippocampus waleananus) Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nSmith hopes that his book will \u201cinspire and educate people about coral reefs.\u201d But while he communicates the threats, his main aim is to shine a light on the incredible animals that are out there.\n\n\u201cWe hear so much doom and gloom about the environment, and while I think it\u2019s important to realize this is happening, the best starting point is to teach people what is there \u2026 The more people know about these animals and the ecosystem, the more they want to protect it,\u201d he says.\n\nSmith wants to take readers on a journey of discovery and exploration. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s still to be discovered, we keep finding new things,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s a beacon of positivity. There are things out there to save and we can still do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIndia on Thursday became the fourth country to successfully achieve an unmanned docking in space, a feat seen as pivotal for future missions as New Delhi cements its place as a global space power.\n\nThe United States, Russia and China are the only other countries to have developed and tested the docking capability.\n\n\u201cSpacecraft docking successfully completed! A historic moment,\u201d the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said on X.\n\nThe Indian space agency\u2019s mission, called the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDex), involved deploying two small spacecraft, weighing about 220 kilograms each, into low-earth orbit. The two spacecraft, called Target and Chaser, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in southern Andhra Pradesh state on December 30 aboard an Indian-made PSLV rocket.\n\nOn Thursday, they conducted a rendezvous before docking together.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to our scientists at ISRO and the entire space fraternity for the successful demonstration of space docking of satellites. It is a significant stepping stone for India\u2019s ambitious space missions in the years to come,\u201d Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X.\n\nIn-docking technology is critical for future space endeavors, such as satellite servicing and when multiple rocket launches are required to achieve mission objectives.\n\nDomestically developed docking technology will be crucial if India is to succeed in advancing its ambition of putting an Indian national on the moon, building a home-grown space station, and returning lunar samples, according to the ISRO.\n\nThe technology will allow India to transfer materials from one satellite or spacecraft to another, such as payloads, lunar samples or, eventually, humans in space, Singh told reporters at a press conference on December 31.\n\nAs part of the mission, the docked spacecraft will also demonstrate the transfer of electric power between them, once they are linked. This is essential for operating in-space robotics, spacecraft control, and payload operations during future missions.\n\nBefore the docking, India on Sunday conducted a \u201ctrial attempt\u201d where the two satellites were brought progressively closer together in orbit until they reached 3 meters apart, before moving back to a \u201csafe distance.\u201d\n\nThe successful docking came after the experiment was twice postponed on January 7 and 9 due to technical issues, and the spacecraft drifting more than expected during a maneuver to bring them closer together.\n\nA global space race\n\nIndia\u2019s space ambitions have accelerated under Modi, who was elected to a third term last June and has tried to assert India\u2019s place on the global stage.\n\nIn 2023, India joined an elite space club becoming the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the moon. The historic Chandrayaan-3 mission, the first to make a soft landing close to the moon\u2019s unexplored South Pole, has collected samples that are helping scientists understand how the moon was formed and evolved over time.\n\nAs part of its ambitious plans, India aims to launch its first crewed mission to space in the next few years, and put an astronaut on the moon \u2013 a feat only ever achieved by the US \u2013 by 2040.\n\nThe country has also set its sights on building its own space station by 2035, which will be called the \u201cBharatiya Antariksha Station,\u201d and launching its first orbital mission to Venus in 2028. It also plans to return moon samples as part of its ongoing lunar Chandarayaan program in 2027.\n\nIndia has also made a major push to commercialize its space sector in recent years, allowing private enterprise and easing approvals for foreign investment, which has focused on building and launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit more cheaply.\n\nFor Sunday\u2019s docking experiment, the rocket and spacecraft were integrated and tested at private company Ananth Technologies, in a first for the country.",

            "title": "Chinese citizens stand trial for fentanyl-related charges in landmark US case",
            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nTwo Chinese citizens are standing trial in New York for charges related to the illicit fentanyl trade in a landmark case as officials aim to crack down on the movement of the deadly drug and its components from China to the United States.\n\nDefendants Wang Qingzhou and Chen Yiyi were apprehended in a sting operation in Fiji in June 2023, expelled from the South Pacific island nation and subsequently arrested in the US. Their trial began Wednesday at New York\u2019s Southern District Court.\n\nTheir 2023 indictments were among the first prosecutions against Chinese nationals and China-based companies for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals into the US. Wang and Chen are believed to be the first Chinese nationals arrested and extradited on such charges.\n\nProsecutors say the defendants and the company that employed them, chemical manufacturer Hubei Amarvel Biotech, shipped more than 200 kilograms of illicit fentanyl-related chemical precursors to the US \u2013 a quantity that could make enough deadly doses of the drug to kill 25 million Americans.\n\nAmarvel Biotech is one of a number of China-based suppliers of such precursor chemicals whose products \u2013 typically synthesized into finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico \u2013 are fueling a drug crisis across America, prosecutors said in their indictment.\n\nFentanyl overdoses have surged in recent years to become a leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to government data.\n\nIn opening remarks on Wednesday, government prosecutor Kevin Sullivan looked to localize the case for the New York City courtroom, describing it as \u201cabout two people who agreed to ship tons of chemicals from China to the US to manufacture fentanyl, right here in New York.\u201d\n\nAlleging that Wang and Chen were hoping to help a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant build a drug lab in the city, he added: \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the drug lab in New York, instead, they got arrested.\u201d\n\nWang\u2019s defense lawyer David Mou told the jury in his opening statement to \u201cstay open-minded,\u201d reminding them that \u201cnot a gram of fentanyl was produced\u201d in this case, while claiming the chemicals in question were \u201cinsufficient to make fentanyl.\u201d\n\nUndercover investigation\n\nThe company \u2013 as well as Wang, an Amarvel Biotech executive, Chen, a marketing manager, and a third company employee Anita Yang, who remains at large \u2013 face allegations that they marketed, sold, and supplied precursor chemicals for fentanyl production in the US in violation of federal law.\n\nAmarvel Biotech, based in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has exported vast quantities of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl and its analogues \u2013 which have similar, but slightly different chemical structures \u2013 while using a variety of tactics to disguise their shipments, according to prosecutors.\n\nAs part of a months-long undercover investigation, US law enforcement officers in May 2023 retrieved precursor chemicals for a fentanyl analogue that had arrived at a warehouse in Los Angeles. The chemicals were shipped from the defendants as a part of a deal with informants working with the DEA, according to the indictment.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, DEA informants arranged two separate in-person meetings with the defendants under the pretext of arranging multiton shipments of precursor chemicals from Amarvel Biotech. They also met to discuss improving synthesizing techniques because the informant claimed to the defendants that fentanyl made from their product had killed American consumers.\n\nIn June, the informants arranged to meet Wang and Chen in Fiji to formalize a purported monthly, multiton order of precursor chemicals. Following the meeting, the two were taken into custody and transported to the US for prosecution.\n\nIf convicted, the two face a minimum of 10 years or up to life in prison.\n\nWhile China and the US have engaged in joint law enforcement efforts to counter the flow of fentanyl, Beijing was not involved in this investigation.\n\nIn a statement to CNN this week, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for Chinese Embassy in the US, condemned the US proceedings, accusing US law enforcement of \u201censnaring Chinese nationals\u201d and calling for their immediate release.\n\n\u201cSuch long-arm jurisdiction and bullyism that tramples on international law has further undermined the lawful rights and interests of relevant Chinese institutions and nationals, and seriously undercut the foundation for China-US cooperation on counter-narcotics,\u201d Liu said.\n\nCurbing the flow of fentanyl\n\nControlling the fentanyl trade has been both a cause of friction \u2013 and a rare point of cooperation \u2013 between the US and China within their broadly contentious relationship.\n\nChina has among the strictest domestic anti-drug policies, but some critics in the US say it has not done enough to help monitor or regulate purchases from buyers aiming to use Chinese-made ingredients to manufacture illegal drugs overseas.\n\nUS lawmakers have also alleged that China is subsidizing the manufacturing of materials that are used by traffickers to make fentanyl.\n\nBeijing has rejected such criticism, accusing the US of \u201cshifting the blame,\u201d while pointing to its own strict drug control measures and efforts to further control production of related substances.\n\nIn 2019, China stepped up its crackdown on the production and sale of the drug, by classifying all fentanyl-related substances as controlled narcotics \u2013 a move welcomed by Washington. But US-China anti-drug cooperation later stalled amid disagreements on trade, human rights, the Covid-19 outbreak and Taiwan.\n\nChina and the US resumed counter-narcotics collaboration in late 2023. At the time, President Joe Biden touted a commitment from Chinese leader Xi Jinping to go after companies who produce precursor chemicals following Xi\u2019s only US visit during Biden\u2019s presidency.\n\nSince then, China has built on earlier efforts to tighten regulation and curb production of fentanyl-related chemicals, including by adding new precursor chemicals to its controls.\n\nChinese authorities, however, have also pushed back against assertions that controlling precursor chemical production can fix the problem, as manufacturers can make minor changes to chemical compounds to synthesize related compounds and avoid violating regulations.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in September, Hua Zhendong, a deputy director of drug analysis with China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, described the country\u2019s \u201carduous efforts\u201d to control fentanyl and its success in reducing the manufacturing and export of finished fentanyl products from China.\n\nHowever, \u201ctrying to completely suppress illegal production through controlling precursor chemicals is fundamentally impossible,\u201d Hua said. \u201cThe most fundamental issue is still reducing demand.\u201d",

And this is just the first step before homeowners and government officials can return to properties to start clearing non-hazardous debris, which could take many more months to finish.\n\nAbout 500 EPA workers will work with the state to start clearing hazards like compressed gas cylinders, paint solvents, pesticides, fertilizers and ammunition, regional FEMA administrator Robert Fenton, Jr. announced Wednesday.\n\nThe EPA will work with law enforcement to safely dispose of large lithium-ion batteries destroyed in the fire, like those in electric vehicles and home power banks that store energy from solar panels. Once damaged, these big batteries pose a major safety risk.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be one of the biggest cleanups with regard to lithium-ion batteries,\u201d the EPA official said. They need to be treated like unexploded munitions because of their volatility. Batteries damaged by fire or salt water can explode and can take a long time to put out because of the lingering chain reaction inside the battery \u2013 something that also causes them to occasionally reignite.\n\nOfficials are working \u201cswiftly\u201d to complete its first phase of hazardous debris removal so that families can return to their properties as soon as possible, said California Environmental Protection Agency Sec. Yana Garcia \u2013 who oversees the state\u2019s equivalent of the federal EPA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of the desire for folks to come in and return their properties,\u201d Garcia told CNN.\n\nPasadena firefighters clean the debris of a burned home destroyed in the Eaton Fire.

Metal and concrete are typically rinsed and recycled. Other debris that can\u2019t be recycled is moved to a landfill, Koger said.\n\nVolunteers gather at the Pasadena Community Job Center to help clean up after the fires on January 12.

Debris removal is typically covered by fire insurance, but insurance companies have been pulling out of California and other states exceptionally prone to wildfires or hurricanes.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to what are your circumstances and can you remove it,\u201d said McIlreavy, the CEO of the disaster nonprofit. Some homeowners \u201cmay find it harder to recover from the fire than others.\u201d\n\nIf the cost of damages exceeds an insurance policy, FEMA can step in to cover the gap. FEMA also helps cover debris removal when it poses an immediate threat to public health and safety, a FEMA spokesperson said.\n\nBut large, unstable debris isn\u2019t the only thing that poses a risk to human health. Burning houses and cars release toxins, plastics and heavy metals like lead into the air, soil and water. The miniscule size of these toxins mean they can travel into a person\u2019s bloodstream and lungs, posing serious health risks, particularly to people who already have cardiovascular disease.\n\nBenhard Dimalanta cleans out their family home destroyed in the Eaton Fire on January 9.

The US Army Corps crews sprayed down contaminated ash with water and sealed it tightly in plastic before disposing of it in a debris site so it could not escape into the air and water. It was a clear sign of how toxic the remains of violent fires are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said McIlreavy.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s government is facing criticism for its clampdown on illegal mining that cut off food and water to hundreds of miners underground, after at least 78 bodies were pulled from a shaft this week.\n\nRescuers worked for a third day in search of survivors Wednesday, after a court ordered their rescue. A police spokesperson said Wednesday afternoon that at least 166 people had been rescued alive from the abandoned shaft. More than 100 others are believed to have died from starvation and dehydration while underground.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) described the deaths at the Stilfontein mine, located around 97 miles (156 kilometers) southwest of Johannesburg, as an \u201cunfolding massacre.\u201d\n\nThe union said in a statement that the miners, \u201cmany of them undocumented and desperate workers from Mozambique and other Southern African countries, were left to die in one of the most horrific displays of state willful negligence in recent history.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s handling of the situation was also called out by the Democratic Alliance (DA), which formed a coalition with the ruling ANC party last year. The DA questioned \u201cwhy the situation was allowed to get so badly out of hand\u201d while calling for investigations into what transpired at the mine.\n\n\u201cA government without humanity\u201d\n\nA video filmed by one of the miners last week showed multiple bodies wrapped in plastic in the mine. The video also showed shirtless, emaciated-looking men with protruding bones and ribs.\n\nSAFTU said survivors who emerged from the mine resembled \u201cwalking ghosts after enduring weeks without food or water\u201d and accused the government of acting \u201cwithout humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that the South African government allowed this situation to deteriorate to such an extent. While it is true that these miners were engaged in illegal mining activities, driven by desperation and extreme poverty, their actions do not justify condemnation to death by starvation,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said.\n\nPolice spokesperson Athlenda Mathe told reporters in November that vital supplies to those underground had been halted in a bid to force them out and put an end to illegal mining in the country, despite SAFTU\u2019s warnings that the hardline gamble could \u201cend in a tragedy.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa loses more than a $1 billion to illegal mining every year and has vowed a crackdown of the trade. There are an estimated 100,000 artisanal miners in the country, known locally as \u201czama zamas,\u201d with violent turf wars often linked to the black market trade in gold.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nTravel can be tough for unmarried couples looking for a bit of privacy in India.\n\nAccommodations routinely decline to let this growing segment of the population share rooms \u2014 especially those looking to book a hotel in the city where they already reside.\n\nWhich is why a change to a budget hospitality booking platform\u2019s policy in a small Indian city has drawn much attention both in and outside the country.\n\nIt all started in early January, when OYO Rooms issued \u201cnew check-in directives\u201d for its partner accommodations in the northwestern city of Meerut, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Delhi, stating that hotels there could deny bookings from unmarried couples at their discretion.\n\nThe move drew swift criticism online, as the brand has long presented itself as a safe haven for unmarried couples.\n\n\u201cWhen it launched that was their whole tagline, \u2018no questions asked,\u2019 to the point that everyone knows that that\u2019s what OYO is for: it\u2019s not just a hotel chain but a hotel for couples looking for privacy,\u201d a 25-year-old media professional who has booked with OYO in Delhi told CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nUnlike in many countries, where it\u2019s common for unmarried couples to stay in a room together, Indian customs still heavily frown upon the practice.\n\nOYO, which launched in 2012, was one of the first platforms to offer a solution for this growing group of travelers, tagging hotels as \u201ccouple friendly\u201d on its app and website. Other start-ups such as Stay Uncle, Brevistay and Nestaway have since followed in OYO\u2019s footsteps and provide rooms by the hour and rental properties that assure safe access for unmarried couples.\n\nMany view OYO\u2019s u-turn, however small, as symbolic of the continuous clash between traditional Indian values and an evolving, modern society.\n\n\u201cCommonly we think of privacy as the right to be let alone or without interference or intervention but in the Indian cultural context, that actually goes against our cultural orientation, which is predominantly collectivist,\u201d said Shagufa Kapadia, a professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies and director of the Women\u2019s Studies Research Center at India\u2019s Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.\n\nOYO said that its decision, which is specific to Meerut, was a response to \u201cfeedback that OYO has received in the past from civil society groups\u201d in the area.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect individual freedoms and personal liberty, we also recognize our responsibility to listen to and work with civil society groups in the micro markets we operate in,\u201d Pawas Sharma, OYO\u2019s North India region head, said in a statement announcing the policy change.\n\nThe family versus the couple\n\nAn OYO ad released in 2024 plays on the company\u2019s existing reputation as a platform that offers rooms to unmarried couples looking for privacy and intimacy.\n\nIn the commercial, a married couple is seen telling their parents that they have booked an OYO room and that their family should accompany them to \u201chave fun together,\u201d which elicits shocked looks around the dinner table.\n\nThe ad then cuts to the family at an OYO hotel with a voice-over: \u201cThis is not that OYO hotel.\u201d Many social media users considered the video, along with the recent move in Meerut, as attempts by OYO to rebrand itself as family-friendly.\n\nAccording to Kapadia, the family unit has always been prioritized over the couple, and even after marriage the privacy granted to couples is \u201cconditional.\u201d\n\nOYO\u2019s recent decision to allow hotels to turn away unmarried couples in Meerut can be seen as a way of appeasing the society in which they are operating, she added.\n\nKapadia noted that religious and right-wing groups often harass establishments for doing things deemed harmful to Indian society, such as providing rooms to unmarried couples in smaller cities like Meerut, which is located in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP).\n\nUP is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and is headed by Chief Minister Ajay Singh Bisht, who goes by the name Yogi Adityanth and routinely dresses in a saffron garment similar to those worn by Hindu saints.\n\n\u201cBeyond civil society groups now it\u2019s also the state which is interfering in private life, dawning a paternal character in an already patriarchal society that increasingly infantilizes its young people, especially women, as a means of control,\u201d Kapadia said.\n\nCNN has contacted the district administration in Meerut for a response.\n\nMeanwhile, managers of the Meerut hotels impacted by the new check-in directives appear to have mixed views.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to say about whether such a policy is good or bad. The only thing is that we don\u2019t want any fingers pointed at us, we don\u2019t want any organizations or community groups to come knocking at our doors asking why we are letting such couples in,\u201d said the manager of one of 21 hotels listed on OYO in the city, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity.\n\nConcern for LGBT Indians\n\nThe owner of another hotel in Meerut, who did not wish to be named, told CNN that it was up to him who he would let stay at his hotel and unmarried couples were not welcome.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. We don\u2019t allow it. We don\u2019t want anyone using it as a shady affair. That is wrong,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hotel. I have the right to choose who I let in. It doesn\u2019t matter if they have a booking on OYO or any other travel website, these are my values.\u201d\n\nThough the owner did clarify that unmarried out-of-town couples might be able to stay there in \u201crare\u201d cases, he wouldn\u2019t tolerate locals due to the assumption that any unmarried couple would be using a hotel to have sex.\n\nThat\u2019s disappointing news for same-sex couples, who cannot legally marry in India.\n\nEven being able to get a hotel room doesn\u2019t mean a same-sex couple can sleep easy.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Delhi identifies as a bisexual woman. She says that even at OYO hotels, it\u2019s impossible to avoid judging eyes. During a recent stay, she says, \u201cmy date looked like a tomboy so even though we were two girls it was kind of obvious and you could see they (hotel staff) had a problem with it.\n\n\u201cThere was a stain on the bed so we complained and the staff member just said \u2018So what? You just have to sit, right? There\u2019s a couch; you can sit there,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nIf hotels listed on the OYO platform are free to deny accommodation to unmarried couples in a smaller city like Meerut, people looking for privacy will have nowhere left to go, she added.\n\n\u201cI live with my family. I can\u2019t just bring someone over. In India it\u2019s very common for people, especially women, to continue living with their families until you get married,\u201d she said. While in Delhi there may be some alternatives, she believes that in cities like Meerut there are none.\n\nHowever, one Meerut hotel owner told CNN that despite the new policy, his rooms would remain accessible to all couples.\n\n\u201cTil there are high court orders saying that, you can\u2019t take action against any couple so long as they are adults, then there cannot be such a policy, there\u2019s nothing OYO can do about it,\u201d said Mukesh Gupta, owner of Hotel O Subhadra Residency, one of the top-rated OYO hotels in the city. His hotel was still tagged as \u201ccouple friendly\u201d on the app and website.\n\nThis issue is unlikely to go away. As the country modernizes, it\u2019s more common for couples to live together before marriage or want to get to know each other away from the prying eyes of their families.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of our relationship, OYO was a big help to us because I don\u2019t know how we would have managed it at that time,\u201d said Terrance, 28, who did not wish to use his last name, about his relationship with his female partner.\n\nThough the couple now resides together, they lived with family for much of their seven-year relationship.\n\nTerrance says OYO\u2019s recent moves make him worried for the safety of other young couples in similar situations.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t have an option sometimes it can end in not such a good way, they might look for some shady place and it might end badly,\u201d he said.\n\nKapadia, the professor, agreed that couples will always find ways to be together but a lack of safe spaces spells disaster, especially for women who have the false burden of carrying the family\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cIn India, parks are a space that a lot of couples use for intimacy and everyone knows about it and it\u2019s okay to an extent, but cops or park watchmen often take that opportunity to harass young couples as they know that they\u2019re probably together without their parents\u2019 knowledge,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rights of the unwed\n\nAs Gupta pointed out, in India there are no laws against unmarried couples staying together at hotels, in their own cities or elsewhere. Despite this, hotel owners continue to deny them rooms, in several cases with the support of police or government authorities.\n\nIn 2015, police raided several hotels and lodges near Mumbai, rounding up dozens of couples. In that case, the Bombay High Court said that \u201cthe action of the police is in clear violation of right of privacy which has been protected by the Constitution of India and it is a facet of right to life which is guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, hearing a case of a similar nature a high court in Madras also held that \u201cthere are no laws or regulations forbearing unmarried persons of opposite sex to occupy hotel rooms, as guests.\u201d\n\nWhen OYO was contacted for further clarification on their new policy in Meerut, they declined to comment.\n\nAside from the impact on Indians\u2019 right to privacy, Kapadia is also concerned about the long-term implications on tourism in the country.\n\n\u201cIn many countries, couples choose to spend their lives together without marriage, so if hotel owners start denying them rooms it would not remain as appealing a destination,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, hotel owner Gupta said that the accommodations that chose to deny couples were likely more concerned with those who had local IDs.\n\nFollowing the move from OYO, Tejas Gowda, a member of a militant Hindu nationalist group called Bajrang Dal, told reporters last week he had appealed to the police commissioner and administration in Bengaluru, India\u2019s tech hub, to implement a similar \u201claw\u201d banning unmarried couples from sharing hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cWe should respect the tradition of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cBy allowing unmarried couples inside the rooms there are many illegal activities happening inside the state as well as the country.\u201d\n\nThese are the very demands that scare the 25-year-old.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Constitution we do have the right to privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are we shutting every damn door that these people can go to. Why is it anyone else\u2019s decision what people do in the privacy of a hotel room?\u201d",

            "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN \u2014\n\nWe are all vulnerable to the rapid spread of phone scams \u2013 including, it seems, world leaders. Thailand\u2019s prime minister has revealed she got a call from an AI system, demanding money in the voice of another famous head of government.\n\nPaetongtarn Shinawatra did not reveal who the computer was mimicking, but said she received a message in a voice identical to a well-known leader.\n\n\u201cThe voice was very clear, and I recognized it immediately. They first sent a voice clip, saying something like, \u2018How are you? I want to work together,\u2019 and so on,\u201d Paetongtarn said.\n\nShe said she later missed a call from the same number, then received a voice message which cut to the chase: \u201cThey sent another voice message asking for a donation, saying, \u2018You are the only country in (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) that hasn\u2019t donated yet,\u2019 emphasizing it. I was taken aback for a moment and realized something was off.\u201d\n\nShe said whoever sent the message \u201cprobably used AI to take the voice\u201d of the unnamed world leader.\n\nScams or scam centers are not uncommon in Southeast Asia. In recent years, investigators say transnational crime organizations have exploited technological advances and the civil war in Myanmar to build a billion-dollar industry scamming people across the world.\n\nIn January, a Chinese actor flew to Bangkok for what he thought was a casting call for a movie. Instead, he was picked up at the airport and driven to a scam center in Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy, a notorious cyber-fraud hub across the border from Thailand.\n\nThis is also a problem for thousands of ordinary people who are lured to Thailand with the promise of white-collar jobs, before ultimately being trafficked to criminal hubs in Myanmar where they are held against their will and forced to steal millions in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile many of the scams currently use phone calls and traditional messaging, there have been warnings that, as AI technology advances in leaps and bounds, millions of people could fall victim to scams using artificial intelligence to clone their voices.\n\nLast year, OpenAI, the maker of generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, unveiled its voice replication tool, Voice Engine, but didn\u2019t make it available to the public at that stage, citing the \u201cpotential for synthetic voice misuse.\u201d\n\nPaetongtarn, who began her political career in 2021 as the chief of the Pheu Thai\u2019s party Inclusion and Innovation Advisory Committee, became prime minister in August 2024.\n\nShe is the third member in her family\u2019s political dynasty to serve as prime minister following her father and aunt, who served for five and three years respectively.",

That, in turn, will protect jobs and bolster the quality of tourism.\n\nHow reviews are written will also be impacted, and the right to reply and demand the removal of bad reviews by hotels or restaurants is also covered in the legislation draft. The law also allows tourism entities to request the removal of any bad reviews \u2014 even true ones \u2014 after two years if the problem has been demonstrably addressed.\n\nCNN has approached Tripadvisor for comment.\n\nWhat about influencers?\n\nThe new law would also make it illegal to pay someone to write a positive review, or to offer incentives like discounts for services if they do, according to Italy\u2019s Communications Regulatory Authority, which would be tasked with enforcing the legislation.\n\nA spokesperson for the unit told CNN that codes of conduct for managers and guidelines for monitoring compliance were yet to be finalized.\n\nThe law would be the first of its kind in Europe.\n\nConfescercenti Nazionale, an association that represents small tourism entities, said the proposed law doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cWe expected a lot and we find very little,\u201d the group said in a statement after the bill was introduced Tuesday. \u201cIt is certainly insufficient to effectively enhance the system of Italian micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\u201d\n\nAssoutenti, an Italian association of nonprofit organizations, warned that the bill should be extended to social media sites and not just official review sites.\n\n\u201cAny measure that guarantees greater transparency to consumers in the choice of products and services is welcome,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, however, it is necessary to regulate the sphere of social networks more effectively, where a myriad of influencers and micro-influencers review restaurants, clubs, spas and accommodation facilities every day through contents that appear to be personal and disinterested opinions, but which in reality are the result of commercial agreements or grants of gifts that are not always clearly communicated to the public.\u201d\n\nThe bill is currently only meant to cover hotels, restaurants and private sites, but could eventually extend to goods and services, including reviews left on major international sites like Amazon.",

            "title": "German economy shrinks for second straight year",
            "text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nGermany\u2019s economy, the largest in Europe, contracted for the second year in a row in 2024, official data showed Wednesday, underscoring the challenges facing the region as it tries to get economic growth back on track.\n\nGermany\u2019s gross domestic product fell 0.2% last year, according to the country\u2019s Federal Statistical Office, following a contraction of 0.3% in 2023.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time since the early 2000s, when Germany was grappling with high unemployment, that the economy has shrunk for two years in a row, according to Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomics at pan-European bank ING.\n\nThe data comes just weeks ahead of a crucial snap election, called after Germany\u2019s governing coalition collapsed late last year over disagreements about how to bolster the country\u2019s weak economy.\n\n\u201cHope is that any new German government would decide on a longer-term plan for economic reforms and investments,\u201d Brzeski wrote in a note.\n\nThe troubles facing the German economy are captured by the crisis at the country\u2019s largest manufacturer, Volkswagen. In December, the automaker announced sweeping changes to operations in its home country, including more than 35,000 job cuts and plans to shift some production to Mexico.\n\nLike Volkswagen, Germany faces high labor costs, weak productivity growth and competition from China. It can also no longer rely on red-hot demand for its exports in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which is increasingly producing locally many of the goods that it used to import from Europe.\n\nAccording to Brzeski, German industrial production remains about 10% below its pre-pandemic levels. Possible higher tariffs from the incoming US administration could make the situation worse because of the potential impact on German exports and \u201cthe effect on German investments if companies were to move production to the US,\u201d he said.\n\nGermany\u2019s central bank said last month that economic stagnation was set to continue this year, with GDP \u201conly beginning to make a slow recovery over the course of 2025.\u201d\n\nThe GDP data bodes ill for the wider European economy, which has struggled to grow significantly after the pandemic and will also potentially face a more fractious relationship with one of its biggest trading partners, the United States.\n\nData from the European Union\u2019s statistics office Wednesday showed that industrial production in the 20 countries that use the euro increased slightly in November compared with October. Still, it remains 9% below its level seven years ago, partly as a result of energy prices kept high by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cSurveys suggest that production will remain subdued over the coming months,\u201d the consultancy\u2019s Europe economist Adrian Prettejohn wrote in a note. \u201cMoreover, the structural headwinds facing Germany\u2019s auto sector will weigh on eurozone industrial production for some time yet.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAustralia has vowed it will take the \u201cstrongest action possible\u201d if Russia has harmed one of its nationals captured fighting for Ukraine, after reports emerged the prisoner of war may have been killed.\n\nOscar Jenkins was captured by Russian forces last month, after which a video surfaced of him being questioned while dressed in a military uniform.\n\nThis week Australian national broadcaster ABC and CNN affiliate Seven News reported that the 32-year-old has likely been killed, both citing sources in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government has been \u201cseeking urgent clarification\u201d on the situation, adding it is \u201cgravely concerned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have called in the Russian ambassador already,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will await the facts to come out. But if there has been any harm caused to Oscar Jenkins, that is absolutely reprehensible. And the Australian government will take the strongest action possible.\u201d\n\nHe declined to elaborate on what actions Canberra might take.\n\nA video showing Jenkins being taken as a prisoner of war surfaced on Russian Telegram accounts last month, which CNN has been unable to geolocate. In the footage, Jenkins\u2019 hands are tightly bound, and he appears to struggle to understand questions posed to him in Russian. A man strikes him twice across the head.\n\nSpeaking in a mix of English, Ukrainian and Russian, he identifies himself as \u201ca soldier\u201d and says he is a teacher in China and a student in Australia.\n\nJenkins is thought to have joined an international brigade among the Ukrainian ranks, which have recruited many foreign fighters since the war began in February 2022. The Australian government advises its citizens against traveling to Ukraine to fight, but some have nonetheless chosen to volunteer with international brigades.\n\nAt least seven Australians are believed to have died fighting in Ukraine, according to ABC, but none was known to have died while being held captive.\n\nPrisoner of war\n\nOriginally from Melbourne, Jenkins has worked as a university lecturer in the Chinese city of Tianjin since 2017, according to a LinkedIn profile under his name.\n\nIf he was killed, he would be the first Australian to have died while being held as a prisoner of war in more than half a century. The last person to have died under such circumstances was H. W. Madden, who was captured during the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the Australian War Memorial.\n\nAustralia has repeatedly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and has given Kyiv close to $1 billion in assistance since 2022, while its military has provided training for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Foreign Minister Penny Wong was in Kyiv last month to announce new assistance packages, and the reopening of Canberra\u2019s embassy in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nDuring an interview with ABC on Wednesday, Wong said her department has been \u201cworking very hard\u201d to ascertain the facts surrounding Jenkins\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cRussia is obliged to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with international humanitarian law,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI want to be clear all options are on the table.\u201d\n\nMultiple reports have emerged throughout the course of Russian troops executing prisoners of war which is a war crime under international law.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Russia\u2019s embassy in Australia referred CNN to a statement given by Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a media briefing last month. She said the ministry was \u201cmonitoring the situation together with the relevant agencies\u201d and blamed Australia for supporting Ukraine.",

            "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has so far refused to cooperate with investigators after he was arrested for questioning on Wednesday, the country\u2019s anti-corruption agency said.\n\nHis arrest - the first time such an action has been taken against a sitting president - was the latest chapter in a weekslong political saga that began with the embattled president\u2019s shock martial law decree last month.\n\nYoon is wanted for questioning in multiple criminal investigations related to his martial law decree last month, including over accusations of leading an insurrection \u2013 a crime punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty.\n\nYoon has so far refused to cooperate with investigators, declining to comment or answer questions Wednesday, according to the the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO).\n\nOn Thursday, after spending the night in solitary confinement at a detention center, Yoon asked to delay his questioning citing health reasons, according to the CIO. His lawyers later said he would not attend the day\u2019s question session.\n\nYoon left his residential compound with investigators in a motorcade Wednesday. The embattled president had been holed up in his fortified residence for weeks surrounded by his Presidential Security Service team, evading arrest as he faces several probes and an impeachment trial.\n\nThe CIO, which is working with police and the defense ministry to investigate Yoon, first attempted to detain him earlier this month, but it failed after an hours-long showdown in which soldiers and members of the presidential security detail blocked some 80 police and investigators from approaching the presidential compound.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol delivers a speech to declare martial law in Seoul, South Korea, on December 3. The Presidential Office/Reuters\n\nFollowing his arrest Wednesday, Yoon released a video message dismissing the investigations into him as \u201cillegal\u201d and said \u201crule of law in this country has completely collapsed.\u201d He said he cooperated with investigators to prevent violent clashes.\n\n\u201cAs a president who must protect the constitution and legal system of the Republic of Korea, responding to these illegal and invalid procedures is not an acknowledgment of them, but in the hopes of preventing unsavory bloodshed,\u201d he said.\n\nYoon\u2019s lawyers have since taken legal action against the warrant, filing for a review of the legality of the warrant in a Seoul court, according to the president\u2019s friend and ally Seok Dong-hyun. The court is set to review the case on Thursday, during which investigators are not allowed to question Yoon.\n\nThe current warrant allows investigators to hold Yoon for up to 48 hours from the time he was detained, until around 10 a.m. local time Friday. The CIO would need to apply for an arrest warrant within that period to detain him further.\n\nWhile the legality of the warrant is under review with the Seoul Central District Court, the arrest period of 48 hours will be paused until a decision is made by the court.\n\nGroups of supporters and opponents of Yoon were both at the scene Wednesday, with videos from Reuters and CNN affiliate YTN showing demonstrators pulling up in buses and gathering in the streets around Yoon\u2019s compound, despite sub-zero conditions.\n\nSome demonstrators could be heard chanting \u201cresign,\u201d \u201cyour time is up\u201d and \u201ctake responsibility,\u201d while supporters of the embattled president chanted \u201cinvalid impeachment,\u201d \u201cfree ROK, hurrah!\u201d and \u201cwe won!\u201d\n\nMany of those backing the leader \u2013 widely seen as a conservative firebrand and staunch US ally tough on China and North Korea \u2013 also held signs with the phrase \u201cStop the steal\u201d printed in English, while others waved American flags.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's supporters scuffle with police officers as authorities seek to execute an arrest warrant, in Seoul, South Korea, January 15, 2025. Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nA YTN video showed a large sign on the back of one bus that read \u201cInsurrection Department \u2013 Yoon Suk Yeol\u201d in Korean \u2013 a slogan typical of anti-Yoon protests since the president launched his martial law decree last month.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a man set himself on fire near the CIO office, Reuters reported. The man, who is in his sixties, was severely burned, Reuters said, citing South Korea\u2019s fie agency.\n\nA court approved a warrant to detain the president earlier this month after Yoon, a former prosecutor, refused to answer three summonses by investigators in recent weeks asking for his cooperation, according to the CIO.\n\nMartial law declaration\n\nYoon declared martial law in a surprise late-night address on December 3, claiming opposition lawmakers had \u201cparalyzed state affairs\u201d and that the move was necessary to \u201csafeguard a liberal South Korea\u201d from the threats posed by \u201canti-state elements.\u201d\n\nMembers of the National Assembly, including some from Yoon\u2019s own party, voted to reverse the declaration some six hours later. Yoon\u2019s order faced fierce backlash from the public and lawmakers across the political spectrum, reviving painful memories of the country\u2019s authoritarian past.\n\nYoon\u2019s lawyers have reiterated that the detention warrant is \u201can illegal, invalid warrant\u201d and have vowed to take legal action against its execution. The suspended president\u2019s backers have also insisted that the actions being taken against him are contrary to South Korean law.\n\nYoon has remained defiant in the face of the investigations and an impeachment trial underway by one of the country\u2019s highest courts.\n\nThe former prosecutor-turned-politician was stripped of his presidential powers last month after parliament voted to impeach him over the decree. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court now has the ultimate say over whether he will be formally removed or reinstated.\n\nThe first day of Yoon\u2019s impeachment trial began Tuesday, but ended after just four minutes when the president refused to show. The trial, which could take up to six months, is set to resume Thursday and will proceed with or without Yoon in attendance.\n\nIn the weeks since Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, the country has been in political disarray with parliament also voting to impeach its prime minister and acting president Han Duck-soo, just weeks after it voted to impeach Yoon. The finance minister Choi Sang-mok is now acting president.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has vowed to take the case against Yoon as a \u201ctop priority\u201d along with other impeachment cases the opposition has pushed for against members of Yoon\u2019s administration, including the justice minister, prosecutors and other senior officials.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA recent exodus of talent from The Washington Post has prompted more than 400 of its staffers to send an unusual letter to the Post\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, expressing alarm over the newspaper\u2019s direction and asking him to intervene.\n\nThe employees, including some of the Post\u2019s best-known correspondents, are asking Bezos \u2013 who rarely visits the Washington, DC, newsroom \u2013 to come and meet with The Post\u2019s leaders.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN on Wednesday, said \u201cwe are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent.\u201d\n\nWhile the letter to Bezos doesn\u2019t mention Post publisher and CEO William Lewis by name, it strongly suggested the staff had lost faith in the newspaper\u2019s leadership.\n\nOver the past year, Lewis has made disruptive changes to The Post and been accused of harboring hostility toward the newsroom. He has also continued to face questions about his journalistic integrity relating to his past work as a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspapers.\n\nBezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, hired Lewis little more than a year ago, charging him with turning around the money-losing publication. Bezos has been a mostly hands-off owner of The Post, and in some ways that has been a blessing, giving the newspaper\u2019s journalists autonomy to write critically about Bezos, Amazon and related topics.\n\nBut the owner\u2019s absence has cut both ways, and many staffers have said they wished he would become more involved, particularly on the business side of the institution.\n\nThe letter to Bezos was intended to be a private plea for help, not a public venting session. But newsrooms are often gossipy places, and the letter leaked out on Wednesday, first to David Folkenflik of NPR.\n\nAmong the signees are boldface Washington Post names like the publication\u2019s chief correspondent Dan Balz.\n\nThe letter acknowledges that Bezos\u2019s decision to block The Post editorial board\u2019s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was \u201cthe owner\u2019s prerogative.\u201d The non-endorsement caused hundreds of thousands of Post subscribers to cancel as a form of protest.\n\n\u201cThis is about retaining our competitive edge, restoring trust that has been lost, and reestablishing a relationship with leadership based on open communication,\u201d the journalists stated in the letter, asserting \u201cwe need a clear vision we can believe in.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Bezos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast month, in rare public comments about the Post, Bezos said at The New York Times DealBook Summit that the Post \u201cneeds to be put back on a good footing again.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t specify how he\u2019ll do that but said, \u201cI have a bunch of ideas and I\u2019m working on that right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve saved the Washington Post once,\u201d Bezos added, and \u201cthis will be the second time.\u201d",

            "text": "Near Des Moines, Iowa CNN \u2014\n\nSusana sat her teenage sons at the dining room table after Donald Trump\u2019s latest election win.\n\nIt was time to reveal a secret.\n\nShe and her husband, Carlos, had hidden it from the boys for years. They didn\u2019t tell them why the family always drove when they went on vacation. They hadn\u2019t explained why they never traveled to Mexico, where many of their loved ones live.\n\nThe parents even stayed quiet when their younger son, 13-year-old Andr\u00e9s, repeatedly declared during the 2024 presidential campaign how much he wanted Trump to win.\n\nBut after the election results were clear, Susana and Carlos opened up to their sons. The parents explained that they\u2019re undocumented, and that things could change soon for their family. The news came as a shock for the boys, who were born in California and are US citizens.\n\n\u201cThey had no idea that we didn\u2019t have papers,\u201d Susana says. \u201cBut if one day something happens to us, we don\u2019t want them to be taken by surprise.\u201d\n\nTelling the boys was an important first step, she says. Now a tougher decision looms.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s return to power nears, Susana says his mass-deportation promises are forcing her family to face a question she hoped they\u2019d never have to ask: Should they leave the US on their own, before it\u2019s too late?\n\nIt\u2019s a decision that Susana says gets more difficult by the day.\n\nShe agreed to share her family\u2019s experience with CNN. But to protect their safety, she asked that they be identified by pseudonyms, that their faces not be shown and that the location of their home not be revealed.\n\n\u201cWe have always been afraid,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we\u2019re even more afraid now.\u201d\n\nOn her way to pick up her children from school, Susana passes a yard sign supporting Trump and a construction site full of immigrant workers. \"He thinks that we give nothing to the country, but we pay taxes, and we work,\u201d she says. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nHer younger daughter doesn\u2019t know the risk their family faces\n\nA glance across her living room on a winter afternoon reminds Susana how hard it would be to go.\n\nTheir 6-year-old daughter, Jessica, leaps joyfully around the house.\n\n\u201cHappy happy happy!\u201d Jessica sings.\n\n\u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 est\u00e1s t\u00e1n happy?\u201d Susana asks, sprinkling a bit of English into her question about why Jessica is so full of glee.\n\n\u201c\u00a1Porque hoy tengo homework!\u201d Jessica says \u2014 and she actually means it. Jessica loves it when her first-grade teacher gives her assignments, and she loves to share the lessons she\u2019s learning with her parents. At night she practices pronouncing English words by reading out loud to them. A leadership award she won at school is proudly posted on the refrigerator door.\n\nShe\u2019s thriving, and her teenage brothers are finding their path, too. It\u2019s what Susana and Carlos dreamed would happen. \u201cEverything that we do is for them,\u201d Susana says.\n\nMore than 4 million other children across the US are in a similar situation, according to Pew Research Center estimates. They\u2019re US citizens, but their parents are undocumented immigrants who could soon be targeted in Trump\u2019s promised crackdowns.\n\n\u201cWe have to think very hard about whatever decision we make, because it\u2019s going to be very drastic for our children,\u201d Susana says. \u201cThey were born here. They only know life here. They don\u2019t know life in Mexico.\u2019\n\nSusana and Carlos haven\u2019t told Jessica about the risks their family is facing.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s too young,\u201d Susana says. \u201cShe\u2019d tell everyone.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s a relief to hear Jessica talk so much about how happy she is. Not long ago, the little girl\u2019s conversations were fixated on something their family never expected \u2014 a loss that changed them forever.\n\nCarlos helps his 6-year-old daughter Jessica get ready for her day at school. Jessica and her two older brothers are among more than 4 million children who are US citizens and live with undocumented parents. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nThey already lost their home once\n\nThe signs of what happened at their house several years ago are no longer visible. But Susana still sees them.\n\nThe three-bedroom townhome is immaculately clean, with gleaming kitchen countertops and a nicely finished floor. Wine racks on the wall are filled with sparkling cider in case the kids ever want to join their parents in a toast.\n\nThis is where Jessica took her first steps, and where 13-year-old Andr\u00e9s and 15-year-old Carlos Jr. grew from giggly little boys to video-game loving teens.\n\nA collection of photos Susana\u2019s sister sent them fills a big wooden frame above the fireplace that says \u201cFAMILY\u201d in the center.\n\nBut Susana knows there are so many things that aren\u2019t here anymore. Nearly all the mementos from her children\u2019s early years are gone. There are no photos from baptisms and first communions, and none of the toys they treasured as kids.\n\nAround 2 a.m. on a fall day several years ago, Susana says, a fire broke out in a neighbor\u2019s garage.\n\nHer nephew, who was visiting, saw the flames and called 911.\n\n\u201cThey told us to get out right away, because it could explode,\u201d Susana says. Her nephew and sons ran out the back door. The fire grew, and Carlos tried in vain to save his car and the tools he kept inside it. Susana wrapped Jessica in a blanket and rushed out the front door with her daughter in her arms.\n\nShe assumed they\u2019d all be back inside the house soon. Surely, she thought, firefighters would be able to stop the blaze before it spread. She was wrong.\n\nThe fire started out small, but swiftly engulfed their entire building.\n\n\u201cI never imagined everything would burn in just 30 minutes,\u201d Susana says. \u201cAshes were all that was left.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, a fire tore through Susana's home. She says the traumatic event changed her family forever. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nShe worried her kids would never recover. Then they said something that surprised her\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time her family had to rebuild their lives, and Susana fears it won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started from zero so many times,\u201d she says.\n\nThey had nothing when they came to the US in 2006 and settled in California. Moving to Iowa years later also forced them to start anew.\n\nAnd the devastation of the fire, she says, was a trauma she worried her children would never overcome.\n\nFor weeks, Jessica sorrowfully told everyone she met that all her toys had been destroyed.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if we are going to have to leave and start from zero again. Susana\n\nAt the time, Susana was ready to leave their neighborhood behind and find a different place to live. The house was already starting to feel too small for their family of five. And losing it was a nightmare she wanted to forget.\n\nBut then her sons said something that surprised her. They wanted to stay.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018This is where all our memories are,\u2019\u201d Susana says.\n\nShe thought of the nearby park where they rode their bikes with friends, and how safe the neighborhood felt. And she realized something else \u2014 rebuilding the house and returning would teach her children an important lesson.\n\n\u201cI want them to face their fears. I don\u2019t want them to be people who run away from what scares them,\u201d she says.\n\nIt took nearly two years for the house to be rebuilt.\n\nSusana and Carlos have just finished paying off the mortgage, and it\u2019s finally starting to feel like home again.\n\nSusana takes a break from folding laundry at home. She says finding clothes that her kids will like is one of her favorite ways to pass the time. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nJessica dips her finger into holy water before leaving for school. Susana always says a blessing over her children before they head out the door \u2014 a tradition passed down from her mother in Mexico. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nBut instead of feeling relieved to own their home, these days, they\u2019re feeling worried they\u2019ll have to leave it behind.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the future,\u201d Susana says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we are going to have to leave and start from zero again.\u201d\n\nShe sounds calm and matter-of-fact as she talks about it. Now is not the time to cry, she says. It\u2019s time to make sure backup plans are ready.\n\nShe\u2019s racing to get passports for her kids as Trump\u2019s presidency looms\n\nSusana can still feel the sting of the notary public\u2019s words from the day when they got the paperwork signed.\n\nThe document designates a family friend to temporarily care for their children if Susana or Carlos are detained or deported.\n\nThe day they filled it out was devastating, Susana says, especially when the notary summarized the form.\n\n\u201cIt sounded so ugly, like we were giving them up for adoption,\u201d she says. In reality, Susana says they\u2019re taking every step they can to keep their family together. She hopes the paperwork would ensure that the kids can be flown to Mexico to join their parents, rather than getting stuck in the US foster care system.\n\nShe\u2019s also racing to get US passports for the kids. They\u2019d need them to travel to Mexico. And she\u2019s worried Trump will act on his promise to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cWe are getting more and more worried. We need to have everything in order now,\u201d she says.\n\nCarlos hugs Jessica as they get ready to leave the house. He takes Jessica and her 15-year-old brother to school every day, then heads to his painting and construction job. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nBut even what should be a simple bureaucratic step has been complicated. The fire that destroyed their home also destroyed the children\u2019s birth certificates. The new copies from California still haven\u2019t arrived. The delay makes Susana anxious, but like so many things, she knows it\u2019s out of her hands.\n\nIt\u2019s one more unexpected way the fire has changed her family and their circumstances. The blaze and its aftermath were devastating, she says, but some changes in their lives have been positive, too.\n\nThey learned not to worry so much about material things, she says, and to appreciate what it means for their family to be together.\n\n\u201cIt made us stronger,\u201d Susana says.\n\nAnd now, wherever they are, they always look for the exits.\n\nIn Iowa, they built a better life\n\nAndr\u00e9s stumbles into the living room early on a weekday morning.\n\n\u201cGo to the bathroom and fix your hair,\u201d Susana tells him, laughing. The 13-year-old runs his fingers through his hair halfheartedly, grabs his backpack, and gets ready to head out the patio door.\n\nIt\u2019s the same exit he ran out a few years ago as the fire was spreading. But today, he\u2019s rushing for a different reason. The bus that will take him to middle school is rounding the corner.\n\nBefore he can get far, Susana pulls him back inside and makes the sign of the cross over his head and recites a blessing. She kisses his cheek as she says \u201camen.\u201d\n\nFor years after the fire, Susana was afraid to leave her children at home.\n\nWhen the boys were toddlers, it was fear for their futures that inspired Susana and Carlos to move from San Jose, California, to the Des Moines area, where a family member lived. They hoped the smaller city would be a better place to raise their family. And it has been, Susana says.\n\nOver the years, visits to the Iowa State Fair have become a highlight of their summers \u2013 the giant turkey legs, the carnival games, the photo booth where the kids dress up like cowboys.\n\n\u201cThis is where we all want to live,\u201d Susana says.\n\nAndr\u00e9s, 13, jets out the door to catch the school bus as Susana and Jessica look on. Several years ago, he ran out the same door to escape from the fire that destroyed their home. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nBut even before the election, they started to feel unwelcome\n\nBut Carlos and Susana started to feel uneasy last year when Iowa lawmakers began debating a state measure that would allow local police to arrest some undocumented immigrants and give state judges the power to order deportations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when our way of thinking started to change,\u201d she says.\n\nThe law passed, and Iowa\u2019s governor signed it. But a court blocked the measure before it went into effect. Still, Susana fears it\u2019s only a matter of time before the law or similar measures become a reality that makes life unlivable in the state her family\u2019s come to love.\n\nDuring the election, \u201cTrump-Vance\u201d signs popped up all over their family\u2019s neighborhood. A nearby house still has one in its yard.\n\nIt\u2019s always the focus of the conversation. It\u2019s what we\u2019re losing sleep over. Most of us have this fear. We are asking ourselves, what are we going to do with what\u2019s coming? We are preparing ourselves to leave, depending on how bad things get \u2026 we can\u2019t live like this, with this fear. Susana\n\nSusana passes it every day when she heads out to pick up her kids from school, and her mind fills with questions.\n\nHow bad will it be this time?\n\nWill he do what he\u2019s promised?\n\nHow can they support that man?\n\n\u201cHe thinks that we give nothing to the country, but we pay taxes, and we work,\u201d Susana says.\n\n\u201cLife is not easy for us. They think that we came to invade, or to get things for free. We haven\u2019t asked for anything. We haven\u2019t stolen any jobs. The work that there is, is the work that we do. We live off of what we earn.\u201d\n\nShe thinks of the Latinos who supported Trump, and how they must not have dealt with the difficulties of being undocumented.\n\nDuring the campaign, her own son said he liked what Trump would do for the economy. But since their recent conversation at the dining room table, Andr\u00e9s has stopped mentioning Trump\u2019s name. Susana says he seems more somber now \u2013 and when asked what he thinks about his family\u2019s future, he says only, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\nThe sun sets on the Iowa State Capitol building in Des Moines, Iowa. When lawmakers there started debating a state immigration law last year, Susana says her family's mindset started to change. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nTo lighten the mood as they weigh what\u2019s next, the family has joked about how to make sure no one eyes them with suspicion.\n\nOne of her sons suggested flying American flags outside their home \u2014 and wearing Trump T-shirts.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t know what we\u2019d be returning to\u2019\n\nWhen they first came to the US after their wedding in 2006, Carlos and Susana hadn\u2019t planned to stay long. Carlos hoped his work as a painter would help them save enough to buy a car, and to fix up a house he\u2019d bought in their hometown. But as their family grew, returning to Mexico seemed increasingly out of the question.\n\nIn Iowa, Carlos learned how to install floors, hang drywall and rehab historic buildings.\n\n\u201cHere, you had to do everything,\u201d he says.\n\nSusana\u2019s held down a number of jobs, too. For years she worked as a janitor at a local Target store during the day, then cleaned a movie theater while her children slept at night. She\u2019s also worked as a cashier at a shop that sold Mexican products, at a pizzeria and at a bakery.\n\nNow she occasionally cleans homes and offices when a friend calls and asks her to fill in. As an undocumented immigrant, it\u2019s becoming much more difficult to find steady work, she says, because employers are more likely to require documents she doesn\u2019t have. After Trump takes office, Susana has no doubt the scrutiny will intensify.\n\nShe and Carlos have met with lawyers multiple times to see if there\u2019s a way to legalize their immigration status. The answer is always the same, she says.\n\n\u201cWe are in the shadows, and there\u2019s nothing we can do,\u201d Susana says.\n\nMeanwhile, in the years since their departure, their home state of Jalisco, Mexico, has become a hotbed of cartel activity. Curfews imposed by criminals, not the government, sometimes keep residents of their town inside at night.\n\nCarlos gets ready for work. He started out as a painter in California when he arrived in the US. After moving with his family to Iowa, he learned how to install floors, hang drywall and rehab historic buildings, too. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nA Bible and a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe sit on the mantel of Susana's home. Her mother brought them when visiting from Mexico. The Bible is opened to a protection prayer. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\n\u201cThe year we left is when all the ugliness started. \u2026 When my mom comes to visit us here, she says it\u2019s very dangerous there, and everything is very hard. It\u2019s not like it was before,\u201d Susana says.\n\n\u201cEven we don\u2019t know what we\u2019d be returning to.\u201d\n\nAnd her children would be even more lost, she says. Susana thinks about what it was like for her to come to the US.\n\n\u201cIt was very hard for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they have to leave one day, they will see how difficult it is.\u201d\n\nShe worries her kids would fall in with the wrong crowd and get drawn into a life of crime, or end up in the wrong place at the wrong time when violence breaks out.\n\nCarlos worries about that, too.\n\n\u201cIn Mexico there\u2019s so much insecurity,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are going to offer them rifles, guns, it would be so easy for them to fall into that, because they\u2019re so young.\u201d\n\nMany of their friends are also weighing whether to leave\n\nBut when it comes to what\u2019s next for their family, Susana\u2019s husband sees the situation differently.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d Carlos says when asked about the family\u2019s plans. \u201cWe have to stay to see what happens, until the end. You can\u2019t leave without knowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if we see that the situation is getting very difficult, we are going to leave before they deport us,\u201d Susana counters.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want her family to face another traumatic situation. And leaving on their own terms, she says, would give them time to settle their affairs and protect the assets they\u2019ve worked so hard to earn.\n\nShe says many of her friends agree. Whether to leave, and when, keeps coming up whenever they get together.\n\nJessica laughs as she chats with Susana in the morning, describing the details of a YouTube show she loves. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the focus of the conversation. It\u2019s what we\u2019re losing sleep over. Most of us have this fear. We are asking ourselves, what are we going to do with what\u2019s coming? We are preparing ourselves to leave, depending on how bad things get,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be very terrible, we can\u2019t live like this, with this fear.\u201d\n\nAlready uncertainty is putting pieces of their life on hold \u2013 the vacation they\u2019d hoped to take to Disneyland, the limo ride Susana wanted to get Carlos Jr. for his latest birthday.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make many plans,\u201d Susana says.\n\nSometimes leaving the US seems inevitable. But she\u2019s still torn.\n\nThe US economy makes so much possible, she says, while in Mexico options are much more limited.\n\nThere is always something that can be saved, even when it seems like there\u2019s no solution. Susana\n\nCarlos Jr. wants to be an architect someday. Andr\u00e9s plans to study business and automotive repair when he gets to high school. Jessica dreams of becoming a doctor or a teacher.\n\nSusana wants her children to have a chance to pursue whatever career path is right for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting so hard to be here,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow ourselves to be defeated so easily.\u201d\n\nAnd she still doesn\u2019t want her children to run from their fears. But the fire also taught her something important: If you don\u2019t get out in time, you can lose everything.\n\nShe sees a powerful message in an unexpected place\n\nSusana and her family didn\u2019t lose everything when their house burned down.\n\nBefore the bulldozers came and pushed away the charred wreckage of their home, Susana made her way to the area that used to be her closet and discovered a few treasured items remained.\n\nThe baby blankets for all three of her children were blackened with ashes, and they reeked of the chemicals firefighters used to stop the fire from rekindling. But they were still intact, and Susana knew she had to take them.\n\nTo some, they\u2019d look like rags. But in those pieces of fabric, Susana saw her family\u2019s story.\n\nAn embroidered baby blanket was one of the few items Susana was able to save from the ruins of their home after the fire. The blanket was blackened beyond recognition with ashes when she first discovered it. Now only a hint remains on the fabric. \"There is always something that can be saved, even when it seems like there's no solution,\" Susana says. Rachel Mummey for CNN\n\nThe hand-embroidered blanket with red and white lace trim came from Mexico. The blankets with blue and pink stripes once swaddled Carlos Jr. and Andr\u00e9s at a hospital in San Jose. The gray blanket with pink footprints came from the hospital in Des Moines, where Jessica was born.\n\nSo much has happened since the days when her children were babies in her arms. But her desire to hold them close and keep them safe has only grown.\n\nSusana scrubbed the blankets over and over after she found them. Some of the colors faded, but eventually, most of the ashes washed away. Today faint gray stains on the fabric are barely visible to the naked eye.\n\nLooking at the blankets now, Susana sees a message she needed to hear.\n\n\u201cThere is always something that can be saved,\u201d she says, \u201ceven when it seems like there\u2019s no solution.\u201d\n\nSusana isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s next for her family, but she knows she\u2019ll do whatever she can to protect them.\n\nAnd she knows that while she waits for answers to so many big questions, she\u2019ll wash these tiny blankets again and again.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nReducing your red meat consumption could have many positive impacts \u2014 on your heart, the environment, and maybe even on your long-term cognitive health, according to a new study.\n\nThose who ate a quarter of a serving or more of processed red meats \u2014 such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs \u2014 had a 13% higher chance of developing dementia than those who had less than one-tenth of a serving per day, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nA serving of red meat is usually around 3 ounces, which would be either two slices of bacon, 1.5 slices of bologna or one hot dog, according to a news release on the study.\n\nResearchers also found that an extra daily serving of processed red meat on average was associated with a 1.6-year acceleration in brain aging, according to the study.\n\nThe study methods are observational, meaning that researchers can\u2019t say for sure that the processed red meats are causing the dementia, only that there is an association between the two. But investigation into the connection will continue, said one of the study\u2019s authors, Dr. Daniel Wang, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cLarge, long-term cohort studies are essential for investigating conditions like dementia, which can develop over decades,\u201d Wang said in a news release. \u201cWe are continuing to piece together this story to understand the mechanisms causing dementia and cognitive decline.\u201d\n\nGetting protein from plants such as beans, legumes and nuts instead of red meat may help protect your cognitive health, according to a new study. Spencer Platt/Getty Images/File\n\nWhy the meat you eat affects your brain\n\nThe connection between red meat and cognitive health hasn\u2019t been studied thoroughly, but researchers have found associations with many other health outcomes, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancers and premature death, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School. He was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cIn particular, processed red meat shows the strongest association due to its high content in salt, heme iron, and harmful additives used for processing,\u201d Song said in an email.\n\n\u201cAlso, the inflammatory response and metabolic disturbances (eg, insulin resistance) associated with high red meat consumption may also play a role,\u201d he added in an email.\n\nFor this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 133,000 people at an average age of 49 from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. The data included detailed health information surveyed over a long period of time, including participants\u2019 diets, and was updated every two to four years, according to the study.\n\nMore than 11,000 study participants were diagnosed with dementia within a 43-year window.\n\nThere are theories as to why red meat might pose a particular risk to cognitive health. Red meat has a high amount of saturated fat and yields an organic compound linked to cardiovascular disease, and the two together may damage the nervous system, which worsens cognitive decline, Song said.\n\nProcessed red meat also has higher levels of substances such as nitrites, N-nitroso compounds and sodium, which pose additional risks to cognitive decline, said the study\u2019s lead author, Yuhan Li, a research assistant in the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nNitrites are ingredients often used in curing meats and have been linked to health concerns, and N-nitroso compounds are also found in cured meats and have been linked to cancer.\n\nThis latest study is important for emphasizing how the food you eat affects the way your brain ages, Wang said in the news release.\n\n\u201cDietary guidelines tend to focus on reducing risks of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes, while cognitive health is less frequently discussed, despite being linked to these diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope our results encourage greater consideration of the connection between diet and brain health.\u201d\n\nLimiting the red meat you eat\n\nReducing the amount of red meat you eat could be an important part of caring for your long-term health, according to the study.\n\nReplacing red meat with plant-based protein sources such as nuts and legumes was associated with a 19% lower risk of dementia and 1.37 fewer years of cognitive aging, according to the study.\n\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research recommends limiting your red meat to three portions a week and eating little if any processed red meat.\n\nWhile making specific changes may help your health, the overall quality of a person\u2019s diet is the main priority, Song said in an earlier CNN article.\n\nIf you want to cut back and eat in a more nutrient-dense way, it might be time to look into the Mediterranean diet \u2013\u2013 which is more of a lifestyle than a restrictive diet.\n\nIt focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, grains, olive oil, nuts and seeds, and the occasional piece of fish while also focusing on social connection and physical activity.",

            "title": "British PM Keir Starmer arrives in Ukraine for security talks with Zelensky ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration",
            "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country\u2019s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as US president.\n\nThe British government says Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign a \u201c100-Year Partnership\u201d treaty in Kyiv, covering areas including defense, science, energy and trade.\n\nStarmer\u2019s unannounced visit is his first trip to Ukraine since he took office in July. He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelensky in 10 Downing Street since becoming prime minister.\n\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backers, the UK has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is due to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine\u2019s post-war economic recovery.\n\nBut the UK\u2019s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on January 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of US aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.\n\nKyiv\u2019s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.\n\nZelensky has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.\n\nBritain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance, and will help ensure Ukraine is \u201cnever again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,\u201d which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense \u2014 especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Batlic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov \u2014 and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,\u201d Starmer said ahead of the visit.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.\u201d\n\nZelensky says he and Starmer also will discuss a plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron that would see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.\n\nZelensky has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance\u2019s 32 member countries say that Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin\u2019s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.\n\nAs the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.\n\nMoscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties, along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine\u2019s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter.

            "text": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food, beverages and ingested drugs, more than 30 years after scientists discovered links to cancer in animals, the agency announced Wednesday.\n\nA synthetic color additive made from petroleum and chemically known as erythrosine, red dye No. 3 is used to give foods and beverages a bright cherry-red color.\n\nThe move acts on a November 2022 petition submitted by multiple advocacy organizations and individuals, including the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Environmental Working Group, which cited links to cancer. The decision by the federal agency also follows in the footsteps of California, whose government banned the additive in October 2023.\n\nManufacturers using red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs have until January 15, 2027, and January 18, 2028, respectively, to reformulate their products, according to the FDA. Foods imported to the United States also must comply with the requirements.\n\nRed dye No. 3 is found in some candy, food and beverage products. Miguel Sotomayor/Moment RF/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action by FDA is long overdue, is a small step in the right direction, and hopefully signals a renewed effort by FDA to do its job despite the many barriers the food industry places in its way,\u201d said Dr. Jerold Mande, adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health, via email.\n\nThe decision marks a \u201cmonumental victory\u201d for consumer health and safety,\u201d said Ken Cook, cofounder and president of the Environmental Working Group, in a news release. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be celebrating this historic decision today without the relentless leadership of public health champions like Michael Jacobson and others who took up this fight decades ago on behalf of consumers.\u201d\n\nRed dye No. 3 is found in at least dozens of candy, food and beverage products, but some of the most popular brands either never used, or have already stopped using, the additive. Fewer than 10% of products made by the candy company Ferrara, which produces Brach\u2019s candies, for example, contain the additive, as the company began phasing out the use of it in early 2023, a Ferrara spokesperson said via email.\n\nJust Born, the company behind PEEPS, stopped using red dye No. 3 in its production after Easter of 2024, according to a spokesperson.\n\nSome companies instead utilize red dye No. 40, which has been considered a healthier alternative as it hasn\u2019t been as extensively associated with cancer in animals.\n\nHowever, California also banned red No. 40 from foods and drinks sold in public schools in September due to concerns over links to behavioral and attention difficulties among children. One study found a potential link to accelerated immune-system tumor growth in mice, and other sources say the dye contains benzene, a known carcinogen.\n\n\u2018The regulatory paradox\u2019 of dye red No. 3\n\nRed dye No. 3 has been permissible for use in food despite the Delaney Clause of the FDA\u2019s Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The clause, in part, \u201cprohibits the FDA from approving a color additive that is ingested if it causes cancer in animals or humans when ingested,\u201d according to the agency.\n\nThe FDA already banned the use of red dye No. 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990 under the Delaney Clause after research found the additive to be carcinogenic at high doses for rats in lab tests. The mechanism for the dye causing cancer in rats doesn\u2019t occur in humans, so those studies didn\u2019t raise safety concerns, and therefore the FDA didn\u2019t revoke the authorization for red dye No. 3 in food, according to the agency.\n\nThe FDA has reevaluated the ingredient\u2019s safety multiple times since its initial approval \u2014 based on trials conducted in animals, not humans \u2014 in 1969, according to the agency.\n\nThere don\u2019t appear to be any studies establishing links between red dye No. 3 and cancer in humans, and \u201crelevant exposure levels to FD&C Red No. 3 for humans are typically much lower than those that cause the effects shown in male rats,\u201d the FDA said in its constituent update posted Wednesday. \u201cClaims that the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and in ingested drugs puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter, because the FDA mandate under the Delaney Clause says that if it shows cancer in animals or humans, they\u2019re supposed to keep it from the food supply,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Pomeranz, associate professor of public health policy and management at New York University\u2019s School of Global Public Health.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision to revoke the authorization for the use of red dye No. 3 is a matter of law, the agency said.\n\nA few other studies have cast further doubt on the safety of red No. 3, including a 2012 report that found a link between the additive and cancer in animals. That same year, researchers concluded artificial food colorings \u201care not a main cause of (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), but they may contribute significantly to some cases, and in some cases may additively push a youngster over the diagnostic threshold.\u201d\n\nThen in 2021, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment study found red dye No. 3 can make children vulnerable to behavioral issues, such as decreased attention. The report also concluded that federal levels for safe intake of food dyes at that time may not protect children\u2019s brain health. The study noted that the current legal levels, set decades ago by the FDA, didn\u2019t consider new research, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision \u201cends the regulatory paradox of Red 3,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, DC. But the agency \u201chas a long way to go to reform the broken system that allowed Red 3 to remain in foods decades after it was shown to cause cancer when eaten by animals.\u201d\n\nThe ban also moves the food landscape slightly closer to that of the European Union, which banned the dye in 1994, with the exception of some maraschino cherry products, Pomeranz said. \u201cEurope takes the precautionary principle when it comes to these things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is not a rational reason within FDA\u2019s mission that they did not ban red dye #3 from food in the 1990s,\u201d and why the agency takes \u201cso long to ban ingredients with known health harms\u201d is unclear, Pomeranz said via email.\n\nAt least 10 other states \u2014 besides California \u2014 have introduced legislation seeking to ban red No. 3 from foods, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\n\u201cAmericans are sick because of our food,\u201d Mande said. Though the United States is one of the wealthiest nations, in terms of overall life expectancy, the nation ranks as 49th out of 204 countries.\n\n\u201cThis is because food companies have lost sight of their primary mission, providing food we will thrive on, and focusing entirely on their profits instead,\u201d Mande added. \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. government doesn\u2019t fund the research needed to determine the exact health risks posed by Red Dye #3. Industry works with Congress to block funding for the needed research.\u201d\n\nThe National Confectioners Association said in a statement that food safety is the number one priority for US confectionery companies.\n\n\u201cOur consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework,\u201d the association said via email. \u201cFor years, our industry has been calling for more transparency, more funding, and more staff resources for the FDA to continue fulfilling its mission, and it\u2019s time to put politics aside and work together to fund the FDA at levels that will allow it to continue its work.\u201d\n\nFood and beverage companies will continue to follow the latest science and comply with all food safety regulations to ensure safe and available choices for consumers, Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs at the Consumer Brands Association, said in a statement via email.\n\nAvoiding dyes in your diet\n\nThe FDA has already required manufacturers to list red dye No. 3 as an ingredient on food labels \u2014 so if you\u2019re concerned about avoiding products containing the dye until the ban is implemented, check ingredient lists before buying. Red dye No. 3 is also listed as \u201cred 3\u201d and \u201cFD&C Red #3.\u201d\n\nArtificial food colorings are mostly found in ultraprocessed foods and beverages you couldn\u2019t make at home, Pomeranz said, so avoiding those products is another way you can eliminate red dye No. 3 from your diet. The Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends parents avoid all numbered dyes, such as yellow No. 5 and red No. 40, as well.\n\nYou can find out how much ultraprocessed food you may be eating by taking this quiz.\n\nFor medications that aren\u2019t topical, look for dyes in the \u201cinactive ingredients\u201d section of the drug labeling or package insert, or search for dye-free versions of some drugs, Consumer Reports suggests. But always talk with your doctor before switching medications.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe past few years have marked the advent of a new lunar space race, with a fleet of robotic spacecraft from various countries trying \u2014 and mostly failing \u2014 to reach the moon and carry out their intended missions.\n\nBut 2025 may offer a second chance for the companies and countries behind those missions that crashed and burned, as well as introduce some new players to the field.\n\nJanuary will kick off with the launch of two lunar landers in one fell swoop: A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry spacecraft developed by Cedar Park, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and Tokyo-based Ispace.\n\nFirefly is making its first attempt to put a vehicle on the moon, but this mission marks a second try for Ispace, after its first lander crashed and blasted a divot in the lunar surface in 2023.\n\nAnd those two landers are only a couple of the uncrewed missions looking to reach the lunar surface \u2014 or seek redemption \u2014 in the coming months.\n\nThis year promises to be among the most tantalizing yet in humanity\u2019s renewed push to explore the moon, with the United States and its allies as well as China scrambling to send robots to the lunar surface. Many of these machine-driven missions are designed to pave the way for astronauts to return to the lunar surface, as NASA plans to do as soon as 2027.\n\nHere\u2019s a glance at some of the moon shots on the horizon.\n\nThis week: Firefly and Ispace are on double duty\n\nThe Blue Ghost lunar lander is a part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative and Artemis lunar program. Firefly Aerospace\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket slated to launch landers for both Firefly and Ispace is set to lift off as soon as 1:11 a.m. ET Wednesday from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Firefly\u2019s lander, called Blue Ghost, will spend about 45 days making a careful approach to its lunar destination around Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or the \u201cSea of Crises,\u201d on the moon\u2019s near side.\n\n\u201cMare Crisium was created by early volcanic eruptions and flooded with basaltic lava more than 3 billion years ago,\u201d according to Firefly. \u201cThis unique landing site will allow our payload partners to gather critical data about the Moon\u2019s regolith (rock and dust rubble), geophysical characteristics, and the interaction of solar wind and Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\u201d\n\nOn board Blue Ghost will be a group of science experiments and technology demonstrations, including ones that will test a \u201cLunar PlanetVac\u201d to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, satellite navigation, radiation-adapated computers, and self-cleaning glass that can wipe away lunar dust, according to Firefly.\n\nFor its inaugural mission, Blue Ghost is expected to operate on the moon for about 14 days before its landing zone is plunged into the frigid temperatures of lunar nighttime.\n\nFirefly is among the participants in NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, program in which the space agency partners with private companies to deliver payloads to the moon. Others contractors include Houston-based Intuitive Machines and Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology.\n\nThe goal of the CLPS program is to give NASA a pool of commercial robotic landers that can ferry cargo to the lunar surface as the space agency works on separate plans to get its astronauts to the moon later this decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time for the lunar economy,\u201d Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he\u2019s \u201c100% confident in our team\u2019s ability\u201d to land the company\u2019s Blue Ghost vehicle successfully.\n\nSuccess, of course, is not guaranteed.\n\nThe target landing site of the Ispace Hakuto-R lunar lander's first mission is captured by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera on April 26, 2023, the day after the attempted landing. The scale bar is 328 feet (100 meters) across. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nIspace, the Japan-based company, understands that all too well: The company\u2019s first attempt to put one of its Hakuto-R landers on the moon ended in a dramatic failure in April 2023 because of navigation issues.\n\nNow, an upgraded Hakuto-R spacecraft, named Resilience, will offer Ispace a second chance.\n\nThe spacecraft will take a much slower path to the moon than Blue Ghost after the landers are deployed from their Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nResilience is aiming to land on the moon roughly four to five months after liftoff, according to Jumpei Nozaki, Ispace\u2019s chief financial officer. On this mission, the Resillience lander will carry a tiny rover as well as tech instruments with various goals, including testing algae-based food production and monitoring deep-space radiation.\n\nIspace is targeting an area of the moon called Mare Frigoris \u2014 or the \u201cSea of Cold,\u201d which lies in the far northern reaches of the moon\u2019s near side \u2014 for its landing location.\n\nFebruary: Intuitive Machines returns for a second round\n\nA rendering depicts Intuitive Machines' IM-2 lunar lander, called Athena, on the surface of the moon. Intuitive Machines/NASA\n\nHouston-based Intuitive Machines made history in February 2024 by putting a US-made lunar lander on the moon for the first time in more than five decades.\n\nThe triumphant touchdown of the company\u2019s Nova-C lunar lander, called Odysseus, spurred jubilant cheers during the company\u2019s webcast. But the landing wasn\u2019t perfect: Odysseus tipped over on its side because of a navigation issue, leaving the vehicle to run with limited power and capabilities.\n\nBut Intuitive Machines will soon get another shot at perfection with a new Nova-C lander, called Athena, set to make its way moonward this year.\n\nThe mission, slated to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, could kick off as soon as late February, the company confirmed Monday. It will aim to land near the moon\u2019s south pole \u2014 a region considered crucial to the current moon race because it\u2019s believed to be home to stores of water ice.\n\nWater found there could be used to provide astronauts with drinking water or even converted to rocket fuel.\n\nMSolo is a commercial off-the-shelf mass spectrometer modified to work in space. The instrument will help analyze the chemical makeup of landing sites on the moon, as well as study water on the lunar surface. Kim Shiflett/NASA\n\nNotably, on board Athena will be PRIME-1, or the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment 1, a NASA-developed tech demo designed to search and drill for water ice.\n\nAlso sharing a ride with Athena will be NASA\u2019s Lunar Trailblazer, a satellite designed to orbit the moon and use remote sensing to detect water.\n\nIf both of those NASA payloads succeed, it will be a welcome win for the space agency, which lost at least four research satellites during its November 2022 Artemis I mission.\n\nThe primary goal of that flight \u2014 to send an unoccupied crew capsule on a test flight around the moon \u2014 went smoothly.\n\nBut a group of small NASA satellites deployed alongside the spacecraft, including two meant to hunt for lunar water, failed to hit their marks.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019 company reaches for the moon\n\nAn artist's rendering depicts Blue Origin's Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander. Blue Origin\n\nBlue Origin, the space company Jeff Bezos founded in 2000, may also debut a prototype of its lunar lander.\n\nThe spacecraft, called Blue Moon, is one of two vehicles NASA has picked to potentially ferry astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon. Blue Origin\u2019s contract for that task is worth $3.4 billion. (The other vehicle NASA selected is SpaceX\u2019s Starship, which will aim to carry out the first landing in 2027.)\n\nA Blue Moon vehicle capable of carrying humans is likely at least a few years away from its debut, but Blue Origin plans to launch a \u201cpathfinder\u201d lander for cargo missions to the moon as soon as this year. It\u2019s not clear exactly when, however, or if that timeline will stick.\n\nThe mission will send a robotic lander to test Blue Moon\u2019s design and engine capabilities, aiming to ensure a smooth ride for future missions with valuable science payloads or crew on board. NASA will also put one science instrument on board called Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume Surface Studies, or SCALPSS, which is a set of cameras designed to monitor how moon dust reacts to the engines of landers as they head in for touchdown.\n\nBlue Origin\u2019s pathfinder spacecraft is slated to launch atop one of the company\u2019s New Glenn rockets, which was set to make its debut flight Monday morning. But Blue Origin aborted the inaugural launch attempt as engineers worked to troubleshoot an undisclosed issue with the rocket.\n\nLater this year and beyond\n\nAn Astrobotic Technology staffer works on the Griffin lunar lander. Jordan K Reynolds/Astrobotic\n\nMore moon missions are on the docket for later this year, though the complexity of such endeavors routinely leads to delays.\n\nThat said, Intuitive Machines could launch its third robotic lunar mission, called IM-3, as soon as October.\n\nAstrobotic Technology may also get a chance to bounce back from a disappointing first go at a moon landing in 2024. Its Peregrine lander began leaking fuel after reaching space last January, forcing the vehicle to swing back toward Earth and abandon its lunar ambitions.\n\nThe company has a new, larger vehicle \u2014 called Griffin \u2014 in the works for a launch as soon as this year. However, Astrobotic has already hit several complications with Griffin, including NASA\u2019s cancellation of a rover meant to fly on board the lunar lander. That rover, called the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, remains in limbo.\n\nBut Astrobotic has said it may outfit Griffin with some of the company\u2019s own technology, such as infrastructure for its planned lunar power business called LunaGrid.\n\nFinally, according to a timeline laid out in early 2024, SpaceX may attempt to send an uncrewed Starship spacecraft \u2014 the most powerful launch vehicle ever made \u2014 to the moon.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether that mission will actually happen in 2025. When reached for comment, a NASA spokesperson confirmed in an emailed statement that conducting an uncrewed test mission to the moon is part of the space agency\u2019s development requirements for SpaceX\u2019s Starship \u2014 but the statement did not say whether the rocket may be ready for such a demo this year.\n\n\u201cNASA continues to work closely with SpaceX on progress toward milestones, including a design review, individual subsystem development and testing, and SpaceX\u2019s integrated flight test campaign,\u201d the space agency said. \u201cPlease refer to SpaceX for more information on their development progress.\u201d\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment nor does the company typically respond to routine inquiries from reporters.\n\nOfficials at NASA, however, have more recently indicated that SpaceX at least plans to ramp up Starship development this year, completing missions that will show how the spacecraft can be refueled once in orbit. (Starship is expected to need its propellant topped off multiple times as it sits in Earth orbit before it can complete a moon mission.)\n\nWhether all these missions squeeze onto the 2025 calendar remains to be seen. What\u2019s certain, however, is that NASA, the commercial space sector, and nations around the globe are fomenting their desires to renew lunar exploration.\n\nNASA, for example, wants more than just to return American astronauts to the lunar surface: The federal agency is seeking to establish a permanent settlement there, angling to compete with the ambitions of China, which is aiming to put boots on the moon by 2030.\n\nThe pursuits by the US and China are in part nationalistic and political. But the objectives are also scientific.\n\n\u201cFrom a scientific perspective, if we think about it, the moon is a repository of information of what\u2019s been happening to both the moon and Earth over time,\u201d said Dr. Bethany Ehlmann, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology and the principal investigator for NASA\u2019s Lunar Trailblazer orbiter. \u201cSo a big question is, where did this water on the moon come from? Is it ancient? And then, what does that tell us about how the Earth got water?\u201d",

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nBlue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos in 2000, has called off a second attempt to launch its 30-story New Glenn rocket.\n\nThe vehicle had been slated to get off the ground early Monday, but the company waved off that plan so engineers could work to address a technical issue with the vehicle.\n\nBy Monday evening, after roughly 16 hours with no update and no word on what exactly that problem was \u2014 Blue Origin took to social media to declare it could make a second attempt during a three-hour launch window that opens at 1 a.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nJust a couple of hours later, however, Blue Origin revealed it would not try for the overnight liftoff after all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving our NG-1 launch to no earlier than Thursday, January 16,\u201d the company said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThat day, Blue Origin will have the same three-hour, early-morning launch window from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. ET.\n\nThe company did not immediately say why it reversed course on plans to attempt a New Glenn launch Tuesday morning. But Blue Origin had cautioned earlier that unfavorable weather conditions at the takeoff site may lead to another scrub.\n\n\u201cTonight\u2019s poor weather forecast at LC-36 could result in missing this window,\u201d the company said in a Monday evening post.\n\nTroubleshooting \u2018anomalies\u2019\n\nIn the dispatch, Blue Origin also disclosed more detail on the problem engineers had sought to fix during the last attempt.\n\n\u201cThis morning\u2019s scrub was due to ice forming in a purge line on an auxiliary power unit that powers some of our hydraulic systems,\u201d the company said.\n\nA \u201cpurge line\u201d is a pipe or tube that can be used to flush out any unwanted gases or debris from a rocket system.\n\nThat detail was more than Blue Origin offered during its webcast of Monday\u2019s launch attempt. At the time, the company revealed only that engineers were grappling with \u201canomalies,\u201d which is aerospace parlance for issues with the rocket that must be fixed before giving the final green light for takeoff.\n\n\u201cWe are standing down from today\u2019s launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue\u201d said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin\u2019s vice president of in-space systems.\n\nAt one point Monday morning, the countdown clock crept down to show less than 10 minutes before liftoff, but Blue Origin periodically added more time as engineers worked to troubleshoot outstanding issues. Ultimately, the problems were not resolved with ample time before the launch window was set to close at 4 a.m. ET.\n\nA smooth inaugural liftoff for New Glenn could be crucial, as the company is hoping to gather copious data from this flight and pave the way for the rocket to quickly make an impact on the global launch industry. New Glenn is the first rocket developed by Blue Origin that aims to be capable of sending satellites to orbit \u2014 a feat that will be necessary for any company hoping to challenge SpaceX\u2019s long-held dominance in the launch market.\n\nBlue Origin waved off the New Glenn launch heading into a busy week for spaceflight. Notably, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying two lunar landers is set to take off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center \u2014 which lies adjacent to Cape Canaveral \u2014 as soon as Wednesday at 1:11 a.m. ET. SpaceX is also due to kick off the seventh test flight of its gargantuan Starship rocket on Wednesday.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nScientists have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur footprints, dating back 166 million years to the Middle Jurassic Period, at Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nThe remarkable find, first spied in 2023 when quarry worker Gary Johnson sensed \u201cunusual bumps\u201d on the ground while extracting limestone for road construction, has been nicknamed the \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d as a nod to the extensive pathways left by these prehistoric creatures.\n\nWhile other Jurassic pathways have been documented globally, the recent \u201chighway\u201d discovery in Oxfordshire is the largest known dinosaur track site in the United Kingdom.\n\nAround 100 volunteers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford collaborated this past June for one week, excavating the tracks and recording as much information as possible about the expansive site.\n\nThe discovery holds particular significance as it aligns with the 200th anniversary of the first-ever described dinosaur, the Megalosaurus, which was found in Oxfordshire in 1824.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really long legacy in this area of exciting dinosaur tracks and body fossils,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropaleontology at the University of Birmingham in England who was involved with the excavation.\n\nA Dewars Farm artist constructed an image of the Megalosaurus (left) and Cetiosaurus (right) as imagined during the Middle Jurassic Period in what's now Oxfordshire, England. Mark Witton/University of Birmingham\n\nThe recently uncovered tracks connect to a previously discovered dinosaur path in the same Oxfordshire quarry back in 1997, but it\u2019s no longer accessible.\n\nHowever, with advancements in technology, the new trackways will provide scientists with an opportunity to analyze previously unavailable information about these extinct animals and unlock secrets about their movements, dietary habits and social dynamics.\n\nA prehistoric roadmap\n\nAerial drone photography captured in April 2024 shows the Oxfordshire \"dinosaur highway\" site before the excavation. University of Birmingham\n\nDuring the excavation, scientists uncovered five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous pathway measuring more than 150 meters in length (492 feet), according to a University of Birmingham news release.\n\nFour of these paths contained tracks from colossal, long-necked, four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs of the subgroup known as sauropods \u2014 most likely Cetiosaurus, which reached up to 18 meters (59 feet) in length, with the largest tracks measuring 90 centimeters (around 35 inches) long, according to Edgar.\n\nLawrence Tanner, a paleoecologist and professor of biological and environmental sciences at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York, likened sauropods to modern elephants due to their massive size and herbivorous diet. He explained that most of the tracks were from hind legs, noting that, similar to elephants, sauropods\u2019 hind feet were larger and often stepped over the impressions left by their front feet.\n\n\u201cThe general rule of locomotion is that the faster the animal is moving, the farther apart the footprints will be,\u201d Tanner, who was not involved in the excavation, said.\n\nThe fifth pathway contained prints from the Megalosaurus, a massive predatory dinosaur known for its distinctive, three-toed feet. Megalosaurus is believed to be up to 9 meters in length (30 feet), and in Oxfordshire, researchers found 65-centimeter (2.1-foot) long footprints.\n\nFrom the footprints, researchers were also able to determine the direction and speed at which the dinosaurs were moving. Most of the giants were moving northeast at an average speed of around 5 kilometers per hour (3 miles per hour), which is comparable to the pace of a human walking, Edgar said.\n\nScientists believe larger theropods, such as the Megalosaurus, lacked running capabilities, unlike their smaller theropod counterparts, which possibly had the ability to run at fast speeds. Tanner said this theropod seemed to be moving at a leisurely pace, as indicated by the footprints.\n\nResearchers noted that the Megalosaurus path intersected with the sauropod trackways, suggesting the predator moved through the area shortly after the herbivores.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint where the dinosaurs were headed, Tanner indicated they may have been traveling along the shoreline to navigate around trees or to search for food sources.\n\nIdeal preservation conditions\n\nSeveral volunteers work to examine the footprints uncovered throughout the Oxfordshire quarry in June 2024. Emma Nicholls/OUMNH\n\nThe preservation of such an expansive ancient trackway is rare and was made possible by the unique conditions of the land during this time frame of the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe distinct footprints indicate the area was once covered in soft sediment, with an ideal amount of water to conserve the impressions.\n\nEdgar compared the site\u2019s ancient environment to the Florida Keys, with its carbonate mud banks and nearby water source.\n\nThe tracks were also quickly covered, likely by a storm, protecting them from erosion caused by wind, water or other animals, according to Edgar.\n\nWhile Jurassic bone discoveries often draw significant attention, dinosaur tracks provide more specific insights into the lives of these extinct animals, Edgar said. Unlike bones, which can be transported to different areas by wind, water or scavengers, footprints remain in the exact locations where they were made.\n\nTracks not only indicate the size of the dinosaurs but also provide clues about their behavior, such as group dynamics and predator-prey interactions. If well-preserved, the impressions can also shed light on how these creatures reacted to environmental changes, according to Tanner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a snapshot into the day of the (dinosaurs\u2019) life, and what they were doing,\u201d Edgar said.\n\nPlanning future discoveries\n\nDuring a one-week excavation in June 2024, groups of volunteers gently remove debris from the dinosaur trackways to reveal the scale of many footprints. Caroline Wood/University of Oxford\n\nDuring the excavation, researchers captured more than 20,000 images of the footprints with aerial drone photography. The team will use these images to create detailed 3D models to further investigate the interactions and biomechanics of the dinosaurs.\n\nOver the next six months to a year, researchers will be working to quickly analyze the data collected and prepare to release their findings to the public.\n\n\u201cWe have these 3D models for the first time, which means that anyone, as soon as we publish them, will be able to see the site and (its) legacy,\u201d Edgar said.\n\nAs a result of the limited time researchers had to document the site to prevent further disruptions to the quarry site, Edgar noted that a large portion of the surface remains unexplored, potentially offering even more information about the diverse creatures that once roamed the area.\n\n\u201cAs quarrying continues, as long as we can, I think we\u2019ll be continuously evaluating and working with the quarry workers as new areas are exposed,\u201d Edgar said. \u201cWe would hope to be doing excavations each summer.\u201d",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTahlequah, the mother orca denoted as J35 who captured hearts worldwide in 2018 by carrying her dead calf for 17 days and over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), is once again displaying a similar act of mourning.\n\nHer newest calf, a female known as J61 to researchers, was first spotted on December 20 in the Puget Sound area on Washington state\u2019s northwest coast by members of the public. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later confirmed the sighting on December 23, according to Dr. Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research. Tragically, by New Year\u2019s Eve, the calf was confirmed dead, he said.\n\nResearchers have reported as of January 5 that Tahlequah is still carrying the calf, said Dr. Brad Hanson, a wildlife biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of NOAA. Updates regarding the mother\u2019s activity with J61 may become limited as her family group, or pod, departs from its main Puget Sound base.\n\nTahlequah is constantly nudging the deceased calf\u2019s body, which weighs around 300 pounds (136 kilograms), with her snout to keep it close and prevent the ocean from pulling the carcass away.\n\n\u201cAs with last time, I think it\u2019s enough to recognize how strong the mother-calf bond is in killer whales (among the strongest social relationships in any animal), and to see that she is clearly not ready to let go,\u201d Weiss, whose doctoral research focused on orca social structure, said via email.\n\n\ufeffThe loss of a calf is not only devastating to Tahlequah but for the rapidly declining population of Southern Resident orcas, which is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 73 of the marine mammals remaining as of 2019.\n\nThe Southern Resident population is noted as \u201cone of the most critically endangered populations of marine mammals\u201d in the United States, according to researchers.\n\nDeep mourning by an orca mother\n\nSome female orcas have been known to carry their deceased offspring, but the time and distance Tahlequah has carried her two dead calves is unusual, according to experts. Candice Emmons/NOAA Fisheries\n\nThis act of grief raises concerns among researchers, including Weiss and Hanson, for its physical and emotional toll on Tahlequah as a member of the highly vulnerable Southern Resident population. Carrying the extra weight of the calf\u2019s body is both weighing down the mother and slowing her movements, which could impact her ability to forage for food.\n\nHowever, Weiss noted that during the orca\u2019s previous 17-day display of grief, there was no visible decline in her condition, which could signal that other members of her pod were helping her receive her food supply.\n\nWhile some female killer whales have been known to grieve the loss of their calves in ways similar to Tahlequah, the distance and time that she carried her newborn in 2018 made her an exception. Her current behavior, mirroring her past actions, is also unusual, according to Weiss.\n\nTahlequah is known to be the mother of another orca, J47, who is now around 14 years old, and also J57, a baby born two years after her 2018 loss.\n\nKiller whales typically reproduce every five years, giving the mother time to recover from the physical demands of pregnancy and giving birth, Hanson said.\n\nWhile no significant data are available to suggest why Tahlequah may have lost two calves within her lifetime, orca pregnancies are fraught with challenges. Nearly 70% of pregnancies in the Southern Resident orca population, which Tahlequah and her offspring belong to, result in spontaneous abortions or very early deaths, Weiss said.\n\nChallenges faced by Southern Resident orcas\n\nUnsuccessful pregnancies and struggles for survival within exclusively fish-eating killer whale communities in the northeast Pacific Ocean can be attributed to challenges from pollutants, noise, inbreeding and a lack of Chinook salmon, which is their primary food source, Weiss said.\n\nThe loss of a female calf like J61 is particularly harmful to the species\u2019 future because it diminishes the population\u2019s ability for reproduction.\n\n\u201cAssuming (orcas) live a full lifespan, you\u2019re looking at them producing five to six calves under ideal conditions, and part of the problem is that most of the females in this population have not produced that many viable calves,\u201d Hanson said.",

It then flies west over the Andes to Santiago, the Chilean capital, which sits in a valley surrounded by the snowy Andean peaks and the Chilean Coastal Range.\n\nLast year is now officially the hottest year on record, with scientific analyses saying that is playing a role in recent extreme weather events, with the LA wildfires being the latest example. (Find out here how you can help residents affected by the unprecedented fires).\n\nRising temperatures might also contribute to an increase in severe \u201cclear air\u201d turbulence, which strikes fast and offers no visual cues. While incidents are predicted to rise, experts say it doesn\u2019t mean flying will be less safe.\n\nPeople and planes\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of travel-based misbehavior this month already, with a JetBlue passenger arrested for opening the emergency exit door on a plane, a man caught with a crocodile skull in his luggage in Delhi and a woman stopped in Germany with 90 kilos (nearly 200 pounds) of luxury chocolate from Dubai.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAh, life on the open waves: a place to relax, get away from it all and watch the world go by \u2014 literally.\n\nMillions of travelers love cruises precisely because of their blend of remoteness and comfort. But what is a much-needed break from the real world when you\u2019re feeling well can be trickier if you fall ill or have an accident onboard.\n\nBreak your leg hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital or have a heart attack, and you might not be so pleased to be offshore.\n\nOf course, every cruise ship has a medical center \u2014 but how big is it \u2014 and what do they do in there? Are the doctors general practitioners or is it more like the ER? And if worst comes to worse \u2014 what happens if a passenger dies onboard?\n\nDr. Aleksandar Durovic, who\u2019s spent the past 20 years as a medic on cruise ships, says that a doctor\u2019s life on the high seas is very different from one on terra firma.\n\n\u201cWatching \u2018The Love Boat,\u2019 you think it\u2019s just going around having dinner and drinks with guests, but it\u2019s really not like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a job full of stress and responsibility. The medical side can be very demanding. Most of what we do on big cruise ships is emergency services, like in an ER, but we are also general practitioners for crew, and take care of chronic medical needs.\u201d\n\nAmy White, director of medical operations for Vikand, which provides medical services for over 150 ships on 33 cruise lines, says that staff are cherry picked to have a background in emergency medicine of at least three years. \u201cThe reason is you can have any and all types of medical emergencies [onboard], she says. \u201cYou need highly trained staff to do that. Lots of vessels have one doctor, so you\u2019re it, there\u2019s no backup other than us [shoreside]. So you need to be able to work alone.\u201d\n\nThe other thing you\u2019ll be tested on before boarding is your bedside manner, says White. \u201cOn ships you have to have hospitality \u2014 guests are always right,\u201d she says.\n\nNurse Amy White has spent a decade in the cruise industry, including onboard Royal Caribbean and Viking ships. Amy White\n\nDurovic spent 13 years working in his native Montenegro before moving onto cruise ships. He spent two years with MSC, and 17 with Carnival. Right now he\u2019s taken a job unlike any other in the industry: he is the sole doctor onboard Villa Vie Odyssey, the ship that is making its way around the world on a three-year voyage.\n\nWhite, meanwhile, started as a nurse working in emergency departments in her native South Africa, and was lured into cruise ships by two co-workers \u201cwho\u2019d been on ships and talked about it all the time.\u201d In 2012, she joined Royal Caribbean as a nurse, then moved to Viking where worked up to the role of fleet nurse, before joining Vikand as medical operations manager.\n\nWhether a cruise is for three years or three days, the setup is usually the same, using guidelines laid out by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP).\n\nCruise lines that are members of CLIA, the Cruise Lines International Association, must have at least one onboard medical professional available 24/7, as well as two medical rooms, one of which must be for intensive care treatment. They must also have onboard equipment for monitoring vital signs.\n\nMany large cruise ships have at least one other doctor, as well as a small team of nurses, though this is down to company policy rather than legal requirements. White compares it to a \u201csmall community urgent care or emergency department \u2014 we have a treatment area, one or two ICUs with a ventilator, cardiac monitoring capabilities and a defibrillator.\u201d\n\nFrom 2026, ultrasound capabilities will also be mandatory on CLIA members\u2019 vessels.\n\nLarge cruise ships also have a morgue onboard for when the worst happens.\n\nThe onboard team is backed up by shoreside staff, including doctors with extensive emergency medicine experience. \u201cThe big companies \u2014 Carnival, Royal Caribbean, MSC \u2014 have a medical department in the office giving you full support,\u201d says Durovic. Smaller cruise companies, such as Villa Vie, work with external providers to get the same service. Vikand is one of these companies, providing medical services for over 150 ships on 33 cruise lines, including the staff onboard, and an on-the-ground team to help with logistics.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ship\u2019s captain, who is ultimately responsible for all the souls onboard. They get involved with logistics if a patient needs to be offloaded, or in the case of a death onboard.\n\nBut otherwise, the medical team is all at sea \u2014 alone.\n\n\u2018Similar to any ER\u2019\n\nAleksandar Durovic is the doctor onboard Villa Vie Odyssey, the ship on a three-year global cruise. Courtesy Aleksander Durovic\n\nFor Durovic, working on a cruise ship is a great combination of adrenaline-fueled emergency medicine and general practice, where doctors can build a relationship with their patients. While most interaction with passengers will be of an emergency nature, when it comes to dealing with the crew, onboard doctors become general practitioners, helping them with chronic conditions, building a relationship and even overseeing their mental health. That\u2019s also the case on Villa Vie, where some passengers plan to remain as long as they are physically able to.\n\nThe vast majority of cases cruise doctors see, however, are emergencies.\n\n\u201cRespiratory problems are the main thing, but anything can arise,\u201d says Durovic. \u201cHeart attacks, heart failure, cardiac arrest. Strokes, injuries, fractured bones, spine injuries and head injuries. It\u2019s similar to any ER around the world, and some ships can be very busy.\u201d\n\nHe says that on large ships, doctors tend to deal with around one death per cruise, while White reckons it\u2019s at least one per quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty common \u2014 more common on lines with more elderly passengers,\u201d she says.\n\nWhite says that while emergency medicine on dry land tends to involve a lot of accidents, on a ship the caseload is different. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily trauma \u2014 we saw a lot of chronic heart disease patients in acute cardiac failure,\u201d she says, remembering how she had to put patients on ventilators in her on-ship days.\n\nThe other thing they see a lot of is stomach flu and respiratory diseases \u2014 not a big deal on land, but crucial to contain onboard. \u201cYou come into the ER with diarrhea, we get you on a drip and send you home. On a ship you get isolated for 48 hours. Those kind of things they don\u2019t teach in nursing school,\u201d says White.\n\nFor Durovic, his early experiences with MSC Cruises, when it was still a young company with a handful of ships, taught him how resourceful ship doctors can be.\n\n\u201cI saw the scale of medicine that you can do on the ship, with support from the land,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have CT scans, you\u2019re in the middle of the ocean and need to stabilize the patient long enough to reach the next port, or transfer to a helicopter to a facility on land.\u201d\n\nSo what happens if you have an accident or feel ill onboard \u2014 and are your chances of recovery as good as they would be on land?\n\nWhat actually happens below decks?\n\nShip medical centers \u2014 like this, on Holland America Line's MS Ryndam \u2014 are small but surprisingly capable. Keith Larby/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nFirstly, here\u2019s hoping you bought travel insurance \u2014 because cruise ship medical care is expensive. Be sure when buying your policy that it includes cruise cover, which usually costs a little extra, and to detail all the countries you\u2019ll be calling at as port stops.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of falling ill while on a cruise is low, but when you travel \u2014 by air and land as well \u2014 there\u2019s always the chance that it could happen,\u201d says Adam Coulter, executive editor at Cruise Critic, who has only had to use a medical facility onboard once \u2014 for sunburn for a family member.\n\nWhatever the time of day or night, you can call for assistance \u2014 ships are mandated by law to have at least one member of the medical team on duty 24/7. If you\u2019re able to, you\u2019ll make your way to the medical center, usually on a lower deck. If you\u2019re unable to move, staff (usually the nurses, says White) can come and see you in your cabin, and can help transfer you downstairs \u2014 certain members of the housekeeping team on every ship are also trained to be emergency transporters and CPR responders, taking clients on backboards or stretchers downstairs.\n\nYou might see the doctor immediately \u2014 or the nurse might book you in, sometimes running blood tests so they can have the results ready by the time the doctor gets involved.\n\nYes, blood tests. Although ship medical centers might be small, they can run a barrage of tests, from bloods to X-rays, and can carry out small surgeries, put casts on broken bones, insert catheters, and even intubate and put patients on ventilators. They can reinflate collapsed lungs and stabilize heart attacks. They can even do blood transfusions, appealing over the loudspeakers for volunteer donors amongst the other passengers. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed what kind of things we can do,\u201d says Durovic.\n\nSurgery is not possible, however. Patients requiring that will need to be offloaded from the ship to an onshore medical facility.\n\nAnd even for relatively straightforward surgery, the logistics can be trying. For a burst appendix, for example, doctors can give you antibiotics, and stabilize you with pain medication, then evacuate you to the nearest onshore medical center for a CT scan and surgery.\n\nBut getting patients onshore takes planning. The onshore medical teams help, says Durovic. \u201cThey work with you on the best route, they coordinate with the navigational team to see where the ship can be diverted, and the weather conditions \u2014 a helicopter can\u2019t fly if there\u2019s dust or if it\u2019s too windy.\u201d\n\nThe captain has the last word on logistics, liaising with the nearest coastguard. If the ship is at sea, depending on the situation (both of the patient and the ship), it might make a diversion to offload the patient by pilot boat or helicopter, if time is of the essence. This is where travel insurance becomes crucial \u2013 because the patient will be sent the bill.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how many people who need a helivac don\u2019t have medical insurance,\u201d says White. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you do \u2014 it depends where you are, but the cost can be up to $50,000.\u201d And while passengers are able to decline, she says, \u201cThey need to understand what the risks are if we don\u2019t get you off the vessel.\u201d\n\nHeart attacks at sea\n\nCardiac arrest is one of the most common incidents medical teams deal with onboard, but while having heart failure at sea sounds like a recipe for disaster, they can often save patients\u2019 lives. Teams can\u2019t do an angiogram onboard \u2014 but not all hospitals can either, says White. What they can do is administer thrombolytics \u2014 medicines that break up a clot in the event of a stroke or heart attack. \u201cWe can mitigate any further damage\u201d before getting patients to onshore care if they need, she says. The same goes for a stroke or a bleed.\n\nEven straightforward accidents and injuries can be repaired onboard \u2014 teams can X-ray then splint, stabilize fractures and even do full casts. \u201cIf it\u2019s a femur fracture we have a traction splint \u2014 we can position you properly and get you off in the next available port. It\u2019s the same with a hip fracture,\u201d says White.\n\nDeath onboard\n\nShip medical teams work with the captain and local coastguard and health authorities to offload sick passengers, as happened with the Diamond Princess moored in Yokohama, Japan, in February 2020. Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf course, sometimes the unthinkable happens and a passenger dies. Urban myths abound \u2014 supposedly, a sudden influx of ice cream on the menu means that someone has died and their body has been stored in the freezer.\n\nShockingly, that was indeed the case until about 40 years ago, says White. \u201cBefore they had morgues, they put them in the ice-cream fridge.\u201d\n\nNow, though, most vessels have a morgue, with the exception of expedition ships, which rarely have room. \u201cSometimes the body is put outside, when you don\u2019t have any land for three days, or [the possibility of] a helicopter,\u201d she says.\n\nToday, says Durovic, there are tight procedures around passenger deaths.\n\nThe medical team must immediately inform the captain, as well as the medical team offshore. They must bathe the body, and notify the authorities on dry land. In the US, that means the coastguard and the Centers for Disease Control, says Durovic.\n\n\u201cThe decide what to do. Sometimes medical examiners will come onboard, and take the body for an autopsy. It depends case by case.\u201d Security is stepped up around the body while it rests in the onboard morgue. White adds that usually police will board the vessel at the next port, to take notes and sometimes interview the doctor. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been on a vessel where there\u2019s suspicion,\u201d she says. Local funeral directors usually offload the body in port, since most authorities don\u2019t allow ships to set sail with a body onboard. The only exception, she says, if it\u2019s a US-Mexico return cruise, where they might be allowed to depart Mexico to bring the body of an American citizen back to the States.\n\nBut before all that, says White, there is a moment of silence. \u201cObviously the doctor pronounces the death, but for most medical teams, the person is given some respect. There\u2019s a moment of silence before the body is prepared.\u201d\n\nIf the person has been in an accident, they must keep all the medical devices used on the patient as testament to their recovery efforts. If, as usually happens, it was a natural death, they are taken to the morgue.\n\nPassengers injuring themselves on ships are relatively rare \u2014 the teams tend to treat incidents like heart attacks or strokes more commonly. Planet One Images/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of administration, and we also speak to the family if they\u2019re not there [onboard],\u201d says White. \u201cGuest relations take good care of the family arranging flights or trauma counseling if they want to stay onboard. And if any crew need mental health support \u2014 because sometimes it\u2019s crew who passes \u2014 we provide mental health support to crew, too.\u201d\n\nAnd although your mind might go straight to a Hollywood-style scenario of a passenger dying of a communicable disease, Durovic says that in his 20 years in the industry, it has never happened (although he\u2019s had several patients in a critical condition with Covid since the start of the pandemic). All the deaths he has handled have been from natural causes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling for the whole ship,\u201d he says, of a death onboard. \u201cShips are supposed to be fun places, for people to enjoy their vacation. Any event like that is really stressful for everyone \u2014 but at least we [medics] have training.\u201d Dealing with a cardiac arrest, he says, is the most stressful event for him and his team. \u201cSometimes you manage it, sometimes not,\u201d he says about CPR.\n\nWhite has never forgotten one of her onboard losses. Once, she had to deal with a man who was on his 40th wedding anniversary cruise when he went into cardiac arrest. \u201cAll he\u2019d wanted to do was see the Panama Canal and we had just left it the day before,\u201d she says, the emotion still in her voice. \u201cIt was just a few minutes before New Year\u2019s Eve. We resuscitated him but we didn\u2019t get him back.\u201d\n\nCrew cleaning rashes and diabetes\n\nShip doctors act as general practitioners for the onboard crew, who often have chronic conditions linked to their work. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile passenger incidents can be the most dramatic duties for a cruise doctor, what\u2019s equally important is general practice for the crew, from long-term support for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, to acute problems \u2014 \u201cWe get lots of galley teams who have rashes from the chemicals they use to clean, and they\u2019re cleaning all the time,\u201d says White.\n\nDurovic says crew can have online psychological help online as well as an evaluation in ports of call.\n\n\u201cBeing at sea is very lonely \u2013 you miss out on a lot of things,\u201d says White. \u201cMy mom became very ill and it took me three days to get home. You\u2019re at sea, there\u2019s nothing you can do. I got to her \u2014 but many don\u2019t.\u201d She says that getting a good team together is crucial: \u201cOn ships you have to learn a lot more than just medicine.\u201d And the teams tend to endear themselves to the rest of the crew. \u201cThe medical crew parties are the best,\u201d she says. \u201cYou put stuff in syringes and dress up as nurses.\u201d\n\nThe fast pace, distance from friends and family isn\u2019t for everyone, but Durovic is in no hurry to give up.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s time to come home, and I eventually will, but I learn a lot about what people are doing around the world,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something to take with you.\u201d\n\nHis patients on his current three-year cruise will be hoping he sees it through to the end of their own odyssey.",

Modern airplanes can whiz people from New York to Singapore or from London to Cape Town, journeys that would have taken weeks or months in previous generations.\n\nBut sometimes too much choice can be paralyzing. We\u2019re in the era of FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out. Social media makes it seem like every person you\u2019ve ever met is on an exotic vacation at any given time, so how do we choose which places to visit?\n\nCNN Travel\u2019s belief is that every place has reasons that make it worth visiting. However, our staff has curated this list of 25 destinations we think are particularly worth visiting in 2025.\n\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan Visit Almaty\n\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan\n\nCentral Asia\u2019s dramatic landscapes and unique urban centers are proving to be particularly alluring. Leading the way is Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Almaty, which as we recently reported has become the region\u2019s new \u201cCapital of Cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of those rare cities that truly has it all \u2014 great food, thriving nightlife, a fast-growing arts and culture scene and easy access to some of the world\u2019s most stunning, untouched landscapes, thanks to its position at the base of the Tian Shan mountains.\n\nAlmaty\u2019s metro stations are literally works of art, the perfect complement to its world-class museums including the Abilkhan Kasteev State Art Museum, which is filled with more than 20,000 artworks and the Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture, which moves to new premises in 2025.\n\nWhat to eat? Almaty is considered the birthplace of \u201cNeo Nomad cuisine,\u201d a blend of modern cooking techniques and traditional ingredients used by the nomadic people who reside in the country\u2019s grasslands. Start your culinary journey at the stunning Auyl restaurant in the Medeu Valley south of the city,\n\nGetting to Almaty is surprisingly easy, too. It can be reached via direct flights from Europe, Asia and the Middle East, while Kazakhstan offers visa-free entry to citizens of a long list of countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. \u2014 Karla Cripps\n\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands, India\n\nPlaces to go in 2025: CNN Travel's annual roundup begins with Almaty, Kazakhstan (pictured).

That may begin to change as the archipelago\u2019s first scheduled international passenger flight \u2014 from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the islands\u2019 capital of Port Blair \u2014 launched in late 2024.\n\nSome who have heard of this area likely unfairly associate it with John Allen Chau, the erstwhile American missionary who attempted to evangelize to an uncontacted tribe in the North Sentinel Islands and was killed. But it\u2019s incredibly difficult \u2014 not to mention illegal \u2014 to access North Sentinel from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and it would be a shame to write off these beautiful, friendly locals and the hospitality they offer.\n\nThe lucky people who have been often compare this string of islands to the Maldives \u2014 but before the big international brands showed up. Expect fresh juices, chai and breakfast parathas at locally owned cafes, barefoot beaches as far as the eye can see and an embarrassment of riches when it comes to water activities such as snorkeling and kayaking.\n\nBarren Island, home to India\u2019s only live volcano, is accessible via private boat, and Swaraj Dweep, just a ferry ride off of Port Blair, is a scuba diver\u2019s dream.\n\nInternet connectivity is also spotty at best in the archipelago, so take an opportunity to truly unplug \u2014 perhaps the biggest luxury of all. \u2014 Lilit Marcus\n\nBequia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nThe sun turns everything golden at Bequia Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. Sylvain Sonnet/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\n\u201cEverybody dreams ah fi go England, my dream\u2019s to go Bequia,\u201d are the opening lyrics to a soca song by artist Marlo Benn, celebrating the charm of this seven-square-mile island shaped like a lightning bolt.\n\nAnd once you take a closer look at Bequia, pronounced Beck-way, it\u2019s easy to see why this stunning destination of white sand beaches, year-round warm temperatures and lush tropical foliage would inspire such affection. Situated half an hour by air from the Caribbean island of Barbados, Bequia is one of the 32 islands that make up St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its neighbor Mustique is undoubtedly more famous, but Bequia\u2019s allure is undeniable.\n\nIn 2024, the island was hit by category 4 Hurricane Beryl, but Bequia has bounced back stronger than ever, with a surge in arrivals reported in September.\n\nWith miles of white sand, Princess Margaret Beach, named after the younger sister of England\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, is its most famous. It\u2019s arguably its most beautiful beach, too, and definitely worth a visit. Over in nearby Friendship Bay, the Bequia Heritage Museum offers a complete look at the island\u2019s history, including its long-standing whaling tradition.\n\nMeanwhile, Bequia\u2019s annual TradeWinds yacht event, which celebrates the culture and marine heritage of the Grenadines, draws in visitors from across the world each year. \u2014 Tamara Hardingham-Gill\n\nBolivia\n\nHip Airstream trailers provide a way to stay overnight at Salar de Uyuni, the world's biggest salt plain. Journey Latin America\n\nAugust 6 sees the 200-year anniversary of Bolivia declaring independence from Spain, under the leadership of Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, who became the South American country\u2019s first president.\n\nWhile plans for the festivities are currently under wraps, 2025 promises to be a year of celebration. While most visitors tend to tack a stay in Bolivia on to a longer trip to Peru, \u201cthe country is a destination in its own right,\u201d says Journey Latin America\u2019s Laura Rendell-Dunn. \u201cYou can easily spend two weeks or more exploring its many highlights.\u201d\n\nCapital La Paz\u2019s restaurant scene is nipping at Lima\u2019s heels with places such as Gustu, opened by Noma co-founder Claus Meyer and now run by Bolivian chef Marsia Taha. It\u2019s winning plaudits around the world for its redefined traditional Bolivian food, including alligator with copoazu (a sweet Amazonian fruit) and llama with llullucha (an Andean algae staple).\n\nTop-notch hotels such as Atix provide cushy digs in the 11,975 feet (3,650 meters) altitude of La Paz. In more rural areas, you\u2019ll find barefoot luxury such as Airstream campers on the Salar de Uyuni salt flats.\n\nWherever you travel in Bolivia \u2014 to Lake Titicaca (bordering Peru in the Andes, it\u2019s the world\u2019s highest navigable lake), Tiwanaku (a nearby pre-Inca settlement) or UNESCO-protected Sucre with its Spanish colonial architecture \u2014 you\u2019ll find luxury digs and, usually, fewer tourists than across the border in Peru. \u2014 Julia Buckley\n\nChemnitz, Germany\n\nA giant bronze bust of Karl Marx looks over cultural events in the heart of Chemnitz in eastern Germany. Peter Rossner/Chemnitz 2025\n\nOnce renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt, this east German city\u2019s most famous landmark is a gigantic bronze head, the \u201csecond-largest bust in the world,\u201d of the 19th-century philosopher. Erected in 1971, the imposing sculpture, a reminder of Chemnitz\u2019s complicated past, has long been a top attraction for visitors. Yet Marx never actually visited the destination in his lifetime.\n\nThis year, the spotlight is shifting to its many other notable characteristics. Chemnitz shines as one of the 2025 European Capitals of Culture, along with Slovenia\u2019s Nova Gorica. Once one of Germany\u2019s richest cities, Chemnitz\u2019s rich diversity is being celebrated in the form of jazz, indie and dance festivals, street art, vintage car rallies and exhibitions.\n\nVisitors will also be able to take in Chemnitz\u2019s eclectic architectural styles. The two-part town hall \u2014 made up of the Old Town Hall, or Altes Rathaus, built in the 15th century, and the Art Nouveau style New Town Hall, Neues Rathaus, erected in the early 20th century \u2014 is one of the finest examples.\n\nUsing the motto \u201cC the Unseen,\u201d officials are championing cultural projects such as the Purple Path, an art and sculpture trail that connects Chemnitz with 38 municipalities and communities, as well as highlighting the city\u2019s commitment to transforming small public spaces into community hubs.\n\n\u201cThe cultural program shows in an impressive way where the cultural heart of Europe will beat in 2025: in Chemnitz!\u201d says the program\u2019s managing director Stefan Schmidtke. \u2014 THG\n\nEngland's footpaths CNN\n\nAll manner of footpaths, bridleways and byways crisscross the English countryside, many of which have been trodden by humans since ancient times. Access to them is enshrined in law passed just over 75 years ago. That means no matter who owns the land, there\u2019s usually a signposted trail, and some of the most idyllic scenery in the world remains open to all.\n\nEngland might not have the epic mountain trails found in some parts of the world, but just yards from almost every doorstep in the land, there\u2019s a hedgerow path wending off into a green tunnel of overhanging trees or onto a romantically wuthering moorland.\n\nPopular long-distance routes such as the Pennine Way (60 years old in 2025), Coast-to-Coast or South Downs Way get attention, but quieter corners of the country have their own waymarked trails. Indeed, anyone armed with an Ordnance Survey map can create their own.\n\nOnly visiting London? Check out the Capital Ring Walk \u2014 a sectioned trail that loops around the city\u2019s suburbs and hidden wildernesses. Or head up the London Underground\u2019s Metropolitan Line and sample the Chess Valley Walk from Chesham to Rickmansworth: 10 miles (16 kilometers) of mostly rural bliss with a Tube station at either end. \u2014 Barry Neild\n\nEswatani and Mpumalanga province, South Africa\n\nEswatini's Sibebe Rock is the largest exposed granite pluton in the world. Edwin Remsberg/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\nThe tiny landlocked Southern African country of Eswatini \u2014 formerly known as Swaziland \u2014 has joined forces with the South African province of Mpumalanga and their neighbor Mozambique for a cross-border tourism initiative known as TRILAND 2024-2025.\n\nThe aim to build a tourism corridor through the southeast African region and while the US government currently advises against travel to Mozambique, its TRILAND buddies are visitor-ready.\n\nMpumalanga province is home to Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, the third biggest canyon in the world after the Grand Canyon and Namibia\u2019s Fish River Canyon. What sets Blyde River apart, though, is that it\u2019s richly blanketed in green subtropical vegetation. God\u2019s Window is one of the most spectacular viewpoints on what\u2019s known as the Panorama Route. Visitors often combine it with a trip to Kruger National Park, just over an hour\u2019s drive away.\n\nIn Eswatini, Sibebe Rock is Africa\u2019s answer to Australia\u2019s Uluru, but without the crowds. Just 10 kilometers north of the capital Mbabane, it\u2019s the largest exposed granite pluton in the world. It\u2019s a challenging but rewarding hike, best done with a guide, following marked trails, and during the dry season (April to September). \u2014 Maureen O\u2019Hare\n\nGda\u0144sk, Poland\n\nKayakers glide past the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, Poland. Patryk_Kosmider/iStock Editorial/Getty Images\n\nGda\u0144sk is perhaps most famous for being the location where World War II officially began, as well as the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which played an important role in the collapse of communism in Poland. But there\u2019s far more to this port city, located on the Baltic coast of the country, than its connection to defining moments in history.\n\nFormerly known as Danzig, Gda\u0144sk was almost completely rebuilt after the aforementioned war, emerging as one of Poland\u2019s most beautiful and colorful cities. Perhaps fittingly, the Museum of the Second World War, a towering prism situated along the city\u2019s waterfront, stands out as one of the most notable examples of its most stunning architecture. There\u2019s also the 14th-century Artus Court and the Old Town\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s Church, thought to be one of the largest brick churches in the world standing at 78 meters (256 feet) high.\n\nIn 2023, the European Commission\u2019s Report on the Quality of Life in European Cities ranked Gda\u0144sk as one of the best cities in which to live, with the majority of its residents being satisfied with their living conditions.\n\nThis year marks a turning point for the city, with the completion of its \u201cgame-changing\u201d port terminal, moving Gda\u0144sk one step closer to its goal of becoming the main gateway to Central and Eastern Europe. \u2014 THG\n\nGilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan\n\nGilgit-Baltistan is a challenging but sublime region of northern Pakistan. Tjetjep Rustandi/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBack in the 1970s, Pakistan was an adventure travel hot spot, its sublime mountain scenery a key stop on the \u201cHippie Trail\u201d overland route from Europe to South Asia. Decades of political instability put an end to that, but those epic peaks haven\u2019t gone anywhere.\n\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan region in the Karokoram Mountains isn\u2019t the easiest place to get to \u2014 flight schedules can be unreliable, roads can be blocked off seasonally \u2014 but it has more tantalizing peaks than a lemon meringue pie.\n\nIt\u2019s home to five of the 14 \u201ceight-thousander\u201d peaks recognized as the world\u2019s highest. That includes K2, the world\u2019s second-tallest mountain but No. 1 in terms of difficulty and danger.\n\nIn terms of tourism and infrastructure, hiking in this region makes the Himalayas look like a traipse in Central Park.\n\nLast year, Nepal banned solo hiking throughout that country, and this, too, is a place where going alone is not an option. It is, however, now accessible through trips organized by reputable global tour operators, including G Adventures and Wild Frontiers. Intrepid offers a 10-day, fully supported hike through the region known as \u201cLittle Tibet\u201d starting at around $3,000. \u2014 MOH\n\nItalian trains\n\nLa Dolce Vita Orient Express promises fine dining and the romance of the rails. Courtesy Orient Express Italy\n\nLuxury lovers are holding their breath for the launch of La Dolce Vita Orient Express, a super-luxurious train that\u2019ll rattle around Italy from April, with eight itineraries. They\u2019ll include the well-traveled paths of Venice and Tuscany to lesser-known parts of southern Italy, including Abruzzo and Basilicata (the Eternal Stones of Matera itinerary), as well as Sicily to Rome and back.\n\nThose of us with shallower pockets will be relieved to know that we don\u2019t have to spend five figures to ride the rails in style in Italy.\n\nIn December, state operator Trenitalia was ranked the best in Europe, scoring especially highly for its \u201ctravel experience.\u201d Its high-speed Frecce trains connect major cities on a T-shape down the peninsula, often faster than flying. For a touch of dolce vita luxury, book the Executive class, a carriage with huge recliner chairs and butler service.\n\nThere are also the Treni Turistici Italiani (TTI) trains \u2014 often vintage \u2014 that have been reupholstered and redesigned to cater for a luxurious visitor experience. New routes for 2025 include a cross-border summer service from Milan to Saint-Rapha\u00ebl on France\u2019s C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, and a seasonal night train from Rome to Lecce in the sizzling southern Puglia region. \u2014 JB\n\nKa\u00e7kar Mountains, Turkey\n\nChoose a rustic-chic cabin for the best views of the Ka\u00e7kar Mountains. Maureen O'Hare/CNN\n\n\u200b\u200bTucked away in the northeast corner of Turkey between the Black Sea and Georgia lies this thousand-kilometer-long coastal mountain range. The Ka\u00e7kar Mountains\u2019 mild, humid climate means this is an alpine idyll brimming with biodiversity.\n\nIn summer, the slopes are carpeted with wildflowers, making the area popular with hikers, while hazelnut fields and tea plantations hint at the region\u2019s excellent produce.\n\nThis is also the home of the prized Caucasian honey bee, and hives are a common sight in this quiet and rural region, which has been a national park since 1994.\n\nIn October, visitors come to admire the spectacular russets and yellows of the fall foliage. The mountains\u2019 craggy peaks rise to almost 4,000 meters (13,120 feet), and there are glaciers and glacier lakes in their upper reaches. There are also plenty of waterfalls and streams, with the 63-meter (207-foot) Maral Waterfall, one of the tallest in the country.\n\nSkiing and heli-skiing are increasingly popular winter activities, although the tourism industry here is still in its infancy.\n\nThat\u2019s set to change, though, as the opening of Rize-Artvin Airport on the Black Sea coast in 2022 has made the region much more accessible for international visitors. A flight from Istanbul takes just over two hours. \u2014 MOH\n\nOsaka, Japan Kansai Tourism Board\n\nKansai, Japan\n\nOsaka is playing host to Expo 2025 from April to October.

About 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the famous capital city, Mendoza glories in its own deserved reputation as a para\u00edso del vino.\n\nIn all, the area is home to about 1,200 wineries, and Malbec is prized here. This cosmopolitan city is also known for its world-class restaurants and spas, tree-lined streets and sunny skies. The visuals here are stunning, with the towering Andes Mountains forming the backdrop to the city. If wine\u2019s not your jam, you\u2019ll have other ways to relax.\n\nIf you\u2019re OK with crowds, consider visiting during the annual Fiesta de la Vendimia. Events throughout Mendoza province start in January and February and climax in March, when some 40,000 visitors come to sample local wine varieties. If you go then, you\u2019ll be arriving in the Argentinian summer.\n\nVisit the lovely General San Mart\u00edn Historical Park, known for its 500 species of roses and Natural Science Museum. Or do a day trip to the soothing Cacheuta thermal springs \u2014 you can even take a budget bus and let someone else do all the driving. \u2014 Forrest Brown\n\nNashville, Tennessee CNN\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an even bigger year than usual for country music in Nashville: The Grand Ole Opry is turning 100.\n\nOn November 28, 1925, radio station WSM debuted what was then called WSM Barn Dance, and the famous country music showcase was born. Now the longest-running radio program in history, the Opry has featured performers such as Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton as well as today\u2019s rising stars.\n\nThe Ryman Auditorium, the \u201cMother Church of Country Music,\u201d hosted the Opry for many years before the show moved to the current Opry House in 1974. Visitors can tour both venues. And there will be more shows on the Opry calendar than ever in 2025, including special birthday and anniversary events and select dates at the Ryman.\n\nThere\u2019s more going on in Music City. A new, mixed-use development, Nashville Yards, is expected to open in 2025, anchored by a 4,500-person capacity music venue, The Pinnacle.\n\nThere\u2019s also an effort under way to bring more Asian flavors to Nashville with its first Chinatown. That project, located southeast of downtown in Antioch, will feature a Pan-Asian supermarket expected to open this year as well as numerous restaurants and retail spaces to come. \u2014 Marnie Hunter\n\nNiue\n\nNiue\u2019s territorial waters have been designated a multi-use marine park Hunter Malcolm/Niue Tourism\n\nNearly any South Pacific island you throw a dart at may feel like a suitably away-from-it-all speck on the map. But when it comes to less-trodden islands in this unparalleled part of the planet, it\u2019s hard to compare any place with Niue.\n\nThe tiny self-governing Polynesian island in free association with New Zealand (residents have New Zealand passports) lies roughly between Fiji and the Cook Islands. Since 2022, 100% of Niue\u2019s territorial waters have been designated a multi-use marine park, including a vast no-take zone that\u2019s an important habitat for grey reef sharks and the endemic katuali sea snake.\n\nHumpback whales migrate, give birth and frolic with their calves just offshore from the 100-square-mile island from late June to October, when visitors have the opportunity to snorkel and sometimes scuba dive with them in waters that regularly push 160 feet of visibility (since Niue has no surface water flowing off it, the surrounding ocean is exceptionally clear).\n\nEven visitors who stay on dry land at spots like Scenic Matavai Resort regularly see humpbacks passing offshore during the season (the hotel\u2019s \u201cwhale bell\u201d rings to announce their presence).\n\nMagic abounds above the water\u2019s surface, too. \u201cSea tracks\u201d called Hala Tahi lead from the island\u2019s villages to the cliff\u2019s edge and down to the reefs below, where fascinating limestone caves and chasms and pristine swimming and snorkeling spots said to have been a favorite with Niuean royalty await. Home to just 1,700 people (roughly 600 of whom live in the tiny capital, Alofi), Niue is also a stargazing paradise as the world\u2019s first country to receive Dark Sky designation.\n\nMost visitors arrive on Air New Zealand flights from Auckland (3.5 hours) that come and go several days a week, keeping visitor levels low. \u2014 Terry Ward\n\nNuuk, Greenland\n\nThe Icefjord Centre in Ilulissat offers insight into the culture of local Inuit people. Odd Adersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe rugged landscapes and incredible wildlife of Greenland recently got a little more accessible, thanks to the opening of Nuuk International Airport. This revitalized aviation hub in Greenland\u2019s capital is home to a 2,200-meter (7,217-foot) runway, allowing larger aircraft to land in the Arctic-based Danish territory for the first time. This summer, United Airlines will operate the first direct flight from the US to Greenland, landing in Nuuk.\n\nThe city is a great jumping-off point for exploring the rest of Greenland via boat or plane \u2014 from absorbing the culture of the local Inuit people at the Icefjord Centre in Ilulissat, to marveling at icebergs and considering the impact of the climate crisis at Disko Bay. But Nuuk isn\u2019t only a gateway to Greenland. City highlights include the history-filled National Museum and Archives, and the striking Sedna sculpture on the shoreline, a tribute to the Inuit goddess of the sea.\n\nAs Greenland\u2019s visitor numbers grow, travelers can help embrace sustainable tourism practices by employing local guides \u2014 whether that\u2019s for a locally run walking tour of the city, or to visit neighboring Nuup Kangerlu, a vast fjord that offers humpback whale sightings amid gorgeous mountain surroundings. \u2014 Francesca Street\n\nThe Ozarks, USA\n\nReady for some Americana entertainment?

But those features and more await visitors to the gorgeous Ozark Mountains of Arkansas and Missouri.\n\nThe region is best known for the Americana entertainment hub of Branson (including Dolly Parton\u2019s Stampede) and the Silver Dollar City amusement park (with a new Spring Exposition festival in 2025 \u2014 and don\u2019t miss the recently revamped, immersive Fire in the Hole family coaster). Those are great, for sure, but they\u2019re just the start.\n\nOne of the Ozarks\u2019 best-kept secrets is the Johnny Morris Conservation Foundation, a privately owned, paid-entry nature and history reserve. One of its highlight attractions is Dogwood Canyon Nature Park in Lampe, Missouri. It holds fishing holes, historic chapels and bridges, biking and hiking trails plus a tram tour to visit free-roaming herds of elk and bison.\n\nIn Arkansas, Eureka Springs is a funky getaway with fun restaurants and places to stay, and it\u2019s emerged as something of an oasis for the LGBTQ community. Go floating or fishing at Withow Spring State Park not far from the university town of Fayetteville. For a stunning drive, consider the Mount Magazine Scenic Byway. \u2014 FB\n\nRabat, Morocco\n\nThe Minaret of Rabat's Hassan Mosque.

But all that looks set to change in 2025 with the new Four Seasons Hotel Rabat at Kasr al Bahr, which opened in October 2024, and the opening of the Royal Theater, designed by the late, great starchitect Zaha Hadid.\n\nCountrywide, the tourism industry is recovering from the devastating earthquake that hit the Atlas Mountains in September 2023. There was a 20% increase in travelers to Morocco year-on-year in 2024 (from figures released in November), and 2025 looks to be even more successful, with new flight routes including Los Angeles-Casablanca from Royal Air Maroc, and Newark-Marrakech from United Airlines. Waldorf Astoria is another brand opening up its doors \u2014 its 2025 Tangier property will be its first foray into the country.\n\nFor sports fans, the Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament will take place in December \u2014 while the venues have not yet been announced it\u2019ll be a proud moment for Morocco, whose national team became the first African squad to reach the semifinals of the FIFA World Cup, in 2022.

Via Transilvanica\n\n\u200b\u200bThere aren\u2019t many places left in Europe that still have that undiscovered vibe, but Romania comes close. That\u2019s a gift in these days of overtourism \u2014 for here\u2019s a country that has everything, from the beach resorts of the Black Sea to the drop-dead gorgeousness of the Carpathian Mountains, and is reputedly trying to grow visitor numbers sustainably.\n\nYes, there\u2019s the Dracula thing at Bran Castle, but for other gothic medieval treats in wider Transylvania and beyond, try Timi\u0219oara, Cluj Napoca, Sibiu, Brasov and Sebes. Capital Bucharest has a charming Old Town, now a bit overloaded with tourist bars and restaurants, but the city\u2019s recent history is still a major draw. The jaw-dropping excess of communist-era dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s luxurious former home and his vast Palace of the Parliament (the world\u2019s heaviest building) are worth exploring.\n\nThey contrast with the extreme hardships he forced on the country\u2019s people, charted in the diminutive but essential Museum of Communism. A more idyllic past can still be found in the Romanian countryside. There\u2019s probably no better way to explore this than the recently launched Via Transilvanica, an 870-mile (1,400-kilometer) hiking trail through rural landscapes and villages seemingly frozen in time. \u2014 BN\n\nSan Francisco de Campeche, Mexico\n\nIndependence Plaza in the Old Town of San Francisco de Campeche is a popular spot for visitors.

That\u2019s where San Francisco de Campeche comes in.\n\nThe capital of Campeche state, this harbor city of about 250,000 is located on the western side of the verdant Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Campeche is one of just two states in Mexico with the US State Department\u2019s top safety rating, and the city occupies that sweet spot of having some tourism infrastructure without being \u201cdiscovered\u201d yet.\n\nSeafood lovers should appreciate offerings such as pompano in tin foil, Pan de Caz\u00f3n (Dogfish Bread) and various shrimp dishes that have a Caribbean flair. Architecture and history enthusiasts will be enthused \u2014 the old walled Historic Fortified Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Bastions (fortifications) and colonial churches abound. In the outdoors, the beaches of nearby Sihoplaya and Seybaplaya and the cenotes (freshwater sinkholes) make for splashy fun. And don\u2019t miss the Mayan ruins and tropical forests at Calakmul.\n\nGetting around the city might be easier in 2025 if the light rail system goes into operation in April as planned. \u2014 FB\n\nSierra Leone CNN\n\nSierra Leone\n\nThis English-speaking West African country has plenty to offer those adventurous enough to make the trip, although getting there isn\u2019t easy. There are connections via Brussels and Casablanca, but new airline Air Sierra Leone has yet to deliver direct flights to London promised for late 2024.\n\nTourism is still in its early stages 20 years on from civil war and a decade after a major Ebola outbreak. That means a county unspoiled by excessive visitors and still rough around the edges. Beaches like those at the Turtle Islands, Bureh and River Number Two have crystal waters and white or golden sands. Capital Freetown has markets, museums and, in the ruins of Bunce Island, a poignant tribute to the victims of the slave trade who passed through. Inland rainforests offer hiking and chimpanzee encounters.\n\n\u201cSierra Leone is hands down one of the safest and friendliest countries in Africa,\u201d says travel blogger Helen Davies, AKA Helen in Wonderland, just back from leading a tour in the country. \u201cThe people here are just beautiful, with an energy that\u2019s warm, welcoming and absolutely infectious.

Visitors staying in downtown Stockholm can easily hop on a short ferry to nearby islands like Fj\u00e4derholmarna, where beautifully preserved historic architecture and more watery views await.\n\nBut for those feeling adventurous, the city of Stockholm recently opened a new 270-kilometer hiking trail crisscrossing the Stockholm outer archipelago. An accompanying website helps travelers map out routes.\n\nBack in the city center, visitors can learn more about Sweden\u2019s maritime history at the Vasa museum, home to a preserved 17th-century wreck. Meanwhile, the outdoor Skansen museum offers insights into Sweden\u2019s architectural and cultural history, while the ABBA Museum is interactive, pop-based fun.\n\nAfter a day hiking or sightseeing, don\u2019t forget to embrace the Swedish tradition of fika (AKA taking a break to enjoy a hot drink and a pastry) and sample the cinnamon buns at bustling Caf\u00e9 Saturnus or award-winning Robin Delselius Bageri. \u2014 FS\n\nTaup\u014d, New Zealand\n\nAt Huka Falls, 250,000 liters of water flow over the falls every second.

In the winter, snowmobiles are also allowed.\n\nThe state\u2019s newest such path, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, has had a bumpy start. Devastating flooding in July 2023 caused an estimated $11 million worth of damage to the $31 million trail, delaying its grand opening by a year. It sustained some damage again in July 2024 flooding, but the 93-mile trail is nearly fully open \u2014 save for a handful of miles close to the trail\u2019s southern end and one short detour. The longest rail trail in New England, Lamoille Valley Rail Trail stretches from Swanton in the northwestern corner of the state to St. Johnsbury in the Northeast Kingdom.\n\nThere are plenty of spots to stop along the way \u2014 maybe for a beer or a bite in Morristown, where a variety of breweries, restaurants and shops are ripe for exploration, or to peek at the 150-year-old train station in Danville. \u2014 MH",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nMartin Johnson and his fianc\u00e9, Celeigh Chapman, had spent several years restoring and renovating their home in Altadena by hand. It took only hours to lose the home and everything in it last week.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a kitchen for a year and a half. We had just cooked the first dinner in the house just after Christmas,\u201d said Johnson, who co-owns LA Woodshop, which provides woodworking spaces and lessons for people who want to do it themselves or build furniture professionally.\n\n\u201cWe spent many nights hand-sanding doors and window frames,\u201d Chapman said.\n\n\u201cThe floors took 18 months to finish,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe were weeks away from being done making the house into a piece of art, and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nIf dealing with that financial and emotional loss isn\u2019t enough, they\u2019re faced with what was already a difficult and expensive housing market in Southern California. The massive wildfires that have sent thousands of families scrambling to find some place to live, likely for the next several years, could make everything even worse.\n\nThey\u2019ve been staying with friends since they evacuated, dealing with the stress and anxiety that Chapman says has made it difficult for her to sleep.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll find something,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cIf it ends up being a lifestyle downgrade for more money is difficult to say. We can\u2019t be too selective. We couldn\u2019t be selective even before 10,000 houses burned down.\u201d\n\nReal estate agents and economists agree. They say the sudden surge in demand for housing by those who lost their homes, combined with the plunge in the number of homes available, is likely to send housing prices \u2014 to buy or to rent \u2014 shooting up in the months and years ahead.\n\nShort supply, surge in demand\n\n\u201cWe were already in a housing crisis. Even before this, we didn\u2019t have nearly enough homes for sale. We didn\u2019t have enough homes for lease,\u201d said Los Angeles real estate agent Brita Kleingartner. \u201cNow there\u2019s an overwhelming demand, and we\u2019re just starting to see what that looks like. All our agents have had their phones ring off the hook. Most of showings are for families who have lost everything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sobering,\u201d Kleingartner added. \u201cThe next week will be really heart breaking.\u201d\n\nSome real estate agents are saying they\u2019re already starting to see prices of rental units climb hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a month. Prices of some units that had been on the market are up 15% to 20% in the last week, said Jeremiah Vancans, another Los Angeles real estate agent.\n\nA \"For Sale\" sign sits in a neighborhood destroyed by the Eaton wildfire in Altadena, California.

I imagine it\u2019s going to create more upward pressure on prices.\u201d\n\nBut he said the longer-term impact on prices is tough to determine, as people are trying to get a sense of how much they might get from insurance for their losses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to really tell how this is going to affect the LA market,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still numb. The fires are still burning.\u201d\n\nReal estate agents reported working 12-to-14-hour days because of the surge in demand.\n\n\u201cThere are basically no rentals,\u201d said Jade Mills, a Beverly Hills real estate agent at Coldwell Banker. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone for the last two days asking my sellers if they\u2019d be willing to rent, or calling rentals that are no longer available.\u201d\n\nHer son lost his home in Pacific Palisades, too.\n\nYears to rebuild lost supply\n\nRestoring the city\u2019s lost housing stock is likely to take at least three to five years, according to the real estate agents who spoke to CNN, because of the time it takes to clear the burned homes, reach settlements with insurance companies, work through the permitting process and then find the labor needed to rebuild.\n\nVancans said in addition to the increased prices on some rental units, he\u2019s concerned that those who lost their homes could get cash offers for the property where their houses once stood \u2014 the offers coming from what he calls \u201cpredatory buyers\u201d who are seeking to take advantage of financial misfortune.\n\nHomes burned from the Palisade fire smolder near the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday. Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA study of past wildfires by Redfin showed that the average prices for property can actually fall in the short term as fire-damaged homes or lots that need to be cleared of debris sell at a discount. But that decline doesn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cLike much of the US, California is facing an acute housing shortage,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe wildfires themselves are also making housing more expensive. After a town burns, builders come in and construct new homes, which are typically more expensive. And homeowners who stay frequently invest in making their homes more fireproof, which increases property value.\u201d\n\nBidding wars even before the fires\n\nThe market had already been very tight. Data from the California Association of Realtors shows fewer than 30,000 homes, townhouses and condos sold last year in a county of 3.7 million households, meaning less than 1% of homes being sold. Now suddenly an estimated 10,000 homes may have been lost to the fires, and counting.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that as many as 10,000 people are suddenly added to the buying market. It\u2019s how they were added, as well.\n\n\u201cIn the past five years it\u2019s been bidding-war city,\u201d said real estate agent Brock Harris. \u201cAny house that was under $2 million was getting 10-20 offers. Now with people shopping with insurance money, it\u2019s going to get distorted significantly.\u201d\n\nHarris and his wife, Lori Levine Harris, who is also a real estate agent, have been trying to lend a hand to the people calling them. Johnson and Chapman are staying in an outbuilding on their property temporarily. And Lori Levine Harris has been compiling a spreadsheet among real estate agents of furnished homes available for rent over the last week. But there aren\u2019t nearly enough to go around.\n\n\u201cShort-term furnished housing \u2014 that\u2019s what people are going to need. My phone has been ringing off the hook,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already have limited housing supply, and losing 10,000 homes will exacerbate that situation.\u201d\n\nBut most of the furnished units on her spreadsheet are in some of the more expensive parts of market, such as Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Malibu or Westwood. And they come with staggering rents \u2014 a median price of about $16,000 a month for the 75 properties available, ranging from a relatively affordable $2,600 unit for a one-bed, one-bath apartment, to $250,000 a month for a 22,000-square-foot furnished Beverly Hills mansion with eight bedrooms and 15 baths.\n\nFortunately for people who are renting apartments or homes already, Los Angeles and most of the communities in the county have rent control that limits rent increases at the end of an existing lease. But those looking to move into a vacant apartment because of the fires are likely to face significantly higher rents.\n\n12 months of rent upfront to sign a lease\n\nJoe Thompson, who lives in Pacific Palisades with his wife, two young children and two dogs, said he\u2019s very fortunate that his home was not completely destroyed by the fire. But there was enough damage that it could take months before it\u2019s safe to return to live in.\n\nHis family has been staying in a hotel, and they were on their way to look at a rental unit for the first time on Monday morning. But he said he\u2019s seen prices going up sharply from what they were previously listed for on various online sites.\n\nHe said a friend of his, another fire victim, told him that that he was only able to sign the lease for the home he wanted when he agreed to pay 12 months of rent upfront. Thompson said he\u2019s considering doing that if that\u2019s what it takes to get the home his family needs.\n\n\u201cFinancially, I think the insurance plan we have will be OK for helping with living expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the price-gouging and competing for rentals with everyone who is going through even worse right now is difficult. You\u2019re trying to line up rentals, but you have no idea how long you\u2019ll need it. And the only way to distinguish yourself (when trying to sign a lease) is put up 12 months of rent upfront.\u201d",

But its deliveries for the month show it continues to struggle to rebound from the crippling strike earlier in the fall.\n\nThe company said it had 142 gross orders in the month, mostly for its troubled 737 Max. It was the best sales month of 2024, a year in which the company saw orders initially grind to a near-halt following the incident in which a door plug blew off of a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.\n\nStill, even with the strong sales, December orders were down sharply from the record 371 plane orders it received in the same month of 2023. And it left Boeing with full-year gross orders of 569, down 60% from the 2023 total.\n\nBoeing was hit by a strike by 33,000 members of the International Association of Machinists on September 13, and while they voted to end the strike on November 4, production at the unionized plants did not resume until early December. So, it made only 30 deliveries to customers in December, bringing its full-year deliveries to 348 planes, down 34% from the 2023 total.\n\nGetting more planes out the factory doors and into airlines\u2019 hands is crucial to Boeing\u2019s battered finances, since that is when the company gets most of the money from the sale of a plane. But fourth quarter deliveries overall fell 64% from the final three months of 2023, pointing to another massive loss that will be reported when it releases financial results at the end of the month. Boeing has already warned investors that losses are likely to continue throughout 2025.",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAmerican food markets are running short on eggs, and the situation may not improve for months.\n\nThe highly contagious avian influenza has wreaked havoc on the egg market. In November and December alone, 17.2 million egg-laying hens died as a result of the virus. That\u2019s nearly half of all birds killed by the virus in 2024, according to the USDA. And it will take months to replace those flocks.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t begin fixing it the next day. It is really a six-to-nine-month process. It\u2019s causing some shortages in certain markets that are intermittent and localized,\u201d said Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board.\n\nFewer egg-laying hens means fewer eggs, more empty store shelves and higher prices.\n\nThe average price of a dozen eggs of any kind at the end of December was $4.33, up nearly 25% from the beginning of November, according to Nielsen IQ data provided by the American Egg Board. And that\u2019s on top of what has already been a startling rise throughout the year: Egg prices were up 37.5% year-over-year in November, according to the Consumer Price Index.\n\nAt one King Cullen store in Island Park, New York, a sign on the Long Island supermarket\u2019s empty egg shelf read \u201cas a part of Avian Influenza, select egg varieties may be temporarily out of stock.\u201d\n\nPublix, which has nearly 1,500 grocery stores, mainly in the south, confirmed the chain is experiencing egg shortages as well.\n\n\u201cItems in this section have limited availability. We are working to bring these products back as soon as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nEgg prices were expected to rise around the holidays because of seasonal demand and a bad year of avian flu. But as the holidays came and went, supply didn\u2019t stabilize; it dwindled instead, leaving shelves less stocked and prices higher.\n\nIn the last two months, avian flu spread to dairy farms, infecting egg farms nearby. Extreme weather across the country delayed and changed the flight path of wild birds, the main carriers of the virus.\n\n\u201cHurricanes in the southeastern United States last year actually picked up those wild birds and repositioned them so that they were flying back over the same territory that they already flew over. And again, that just provides a greater opportunity for virus to spread,\u201d said Metz.\n\nMorton Wiliams, a tri-state area grocery chain in the surrounding areas of New York City, has seen egg prices rise across all categories since December.\n\n\u201cOur cost just skyrocketed. It was crazy,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, director of sales and marketing at Morton Williams.\n\nSchwartz said the grocery chain buys from six egg distributors, which allows for multiple channels to get its eggs. But prices remain troubling.\n\nIn mid-October, a dozen conventional eggs cost Morton Williams $2.38. This week they paid their distributors $5.48, and that\u2019s with a 70-cent discount, said Schwartz.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to struggle through this for a while because when I spoke to the farm a week ago, I asked the question: \u2018When do you expect to see relief?\u2019\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nTheir reply was concerning.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have an answer for me.\u201d",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nHow old was Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Godfather?\u201d\n\nThat was the fairly straightforward question my husband typed into Google while the movie played in the background over our Thanksgiving break. The answer from Google\u2019s AI overview: \u201cMarlon Brando was not yet old enough to act in The Godfather when he died in 2004 at the age of 80.\u201d\n\nIt was one of the funnier, somewhat surprising screw-ups we\u2019d seen from Gemini, which like all publicly available artificial intelligence tools is prone to what the tech industry calls \u201challucinations.\u201d He screenshot the answer so that we could have a laugh about it, and then scrolled down to find the first non-sponsored, non-AI search result: an entry from one of the most reliable places on the internet, Wikipedia.\n\nIf I\u2019d written that last sentence at the start of my career, no editor would have allowed it into print. You can\u2019t trust something that anyone can edit, the thinking went, and so it became a bad word in journalism and academia. Don\u2019t cite it; don\u2019t even look at it. Or if you do, for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t let anyone see you.\n\nBut over the past two decades, the free-to-use online encyclopedia has carried on with its mission, expanding its global community of volunteer editors, known as Wikipedians, and ultimately resisting the kinds of platform decay that have claimed other 2000s-era internet phenoms like Facebook, Twitter and, to some extent, Google. (In a statement to Nightcap, Google said it maintains a \u201chigh quality bar with all Search features\u201d and that its extensive testing found \u201cpeople find their results more helpful with AI Overviews.\u201d Meta and X didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nWhat\u2019s emerged is a port in a storm of misinformation, and a potential roadmap for startups as Big Tech continues to abdicate any responsibility for the garbage littering its platforms in the form of AI-generated slop and human-generated propaganda. (By the way, Brando was 47 at the time he filmed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and turned 48 shortly after its release in 1972, according to Wikipedia and multiple obituaries.)\n\nWikipedia is the seventh most popular website on the planet, according to analytics firm Similarweb \u2014 after Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, X and WhatsApp. It is the only one on that list not owned by Alphabet, Meta or Elon Musk (who has recently taken aim at what he called \u201cWokepedia,\u201d for what he and the MAGA right views as liberal bias).\n\nThe nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation hosts Wikipedia, generating the bulk of its financing through small donations and grants. That\u2019s part of the secret to its success, according to Molly White, a researcher and prolific Wikipedia editor.\n\nWith Wikipedia, \u201cthere isn\u2019t some huge corporation enriching themselves off the backs of the free editing\u201d White told me. \u201cWhereas over on Twitter, your free labor is going toward a corporation that is directly enriching Elon Musk.\u201d\n\nElon Musk's overhaul of Twitter included gutting its trust and safety team. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nMusk promptly fired Twitter\u2019s trust and safety team when he bought Twitter, now called X, in 2022. The site now relies on users to fact-check one another through a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system that has done little to counter false information, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate. X users who\u2019ve stepped up to try to debunk lies and flag propaganda recently told the Washington Post that their efforts often feel like a game of whack-a-mole.\n\nThat\u2019s the same system that Mark Zuckerberg revealed last week for Meta, which is preparing to fire its third-party professional fact-checkers who are already straining against a flood of conspiracy theories.\n\nBy Zuckerberg\u2019s own admission, that move is a \u201ctrade-off\u201d that will mean allowing more \u201cbad stuff\u201d on the platforms.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s crowdsourcing model isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 the site has an entry on its own reliability in which it acknowledges instances of vandalism, and it keeps a list of hoaxes that have taken off there. Still, as a general rule, you\u2019re not going to find Marlon Brando\u2019s Wikipedia entry not suggest that he wasn\u2019t in \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d\n\nWhen someone tries to insert bad intel into a Wikipedia page, that edit gets flagged to hundreds or thousands of Wikipedians around the world who keep tabs on various pages. (More than 280,000 editors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month, according to the organization.)\n\nI asked White why the community notes model, which on paper seems in line with the Wikipedia ethos, doesn\u2019t seem to be working so well on X.\n\n\u201cI think that people who are writing community notes are very much in a reactive frame of mind, where it\u2019s not about providing high-quality information \u2014 it\u2019s about preventing some of the most egregious misinformation from proliferating.\u201d\n\nWith Wikipedia, she added, there\u2019s a baseline level of behavior that the community of editors reinforces. \u201cPeople who are trolling or expressing their own political beliefs are not tolerated on the site.\u201d\n\n(No wonder Musk dislikes it.)\n\nBottom line: The internet\u2019s most popular sites are in a state of transition. X and Meta are doing away with guardrails. Google is forcing unreliable AI to the top of its search results. Meanwhile, TikTok is facing a ban in the US and lawmakers are forcing Pornhub to block its content in roughly a third of US states.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s stodgy nonprofit model suddenly looks a lot more appealing. Its community-focused approach to moderation is also taking off with platforms like Bluesky, which has reportedly surged past 21 million users amid an exodus from X.\n\n\u201cThis idea of a social network with the benevolent dictator\u2026 isn\u2019t a particularly sustainable thing,\u201d White said. \u201cIt works until that benevolent dictator either sells the platform or has a political 180 of his own.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRussian-born American photographer Anastasia Samoylova loves \u201cBarbie.\u201d Not only did she wear a hot pink suit to the opening of her own photography exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, she also insisted on taking her teenage son to see Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2023 film \u2014 considering it essential feminist viewing. \u201cIs it perfect? No. But it addresses very complicated and divisive subjects,\u201d Samoylova told CNN in a video call from her home in Florida. She recalls how Margot Robbie\u2019s title character, Barbie, stops the euphoric dance floor in its tracks when she wonders aloud, \u201cdo you guys ever think about dying?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s literally what I\u2019ve been trying to communicate,\u201d said Samoylova. \u201cThis is all pink and attractive, but we are going to die.\u201d\n\nSamoylova, whose work is currently on display at both the Met Museum in New York and the Saatchi Gallery in London, has garnered critical acclaim for her subtle, anxiety-inducing images of Florida\u2019s collapsing pastel-pink landscapes. Her 2019 series \u201cFlood Zone\u201d \u2014 a nod to the unnervingly bureaucratic label that can often dictate life or death \u2014 is a surreal chronicle of an area decaying in real time.\n\nSamoylova's work fuses pastel pink color palettes with images of displace flora and fauna, shown here in \"Pink Sidewalk\" (2017). Anastasia Samoylova\n\n\"Concrete Erosion\" (2019). The series \"Flood Zone\" is a study of real-time climate decay. Anastasia Samoylova\n\nCracked bubblegum-colored concrete, flooded swimming pools, uprooted palm trees and displaced alligators paint a new, unnerving picture of the climate crisis. Samoylova\u2019s images are a far cry from the visual language of starving polar bears and blazing wildfires that often saturate converage around the environment. \u201cEverything is intertwined,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think isolating climate change as something detached and abstract, and visually associated with melting ice caps, is very dangerous because we\u2019re in the moment right now. Every political decision is going to affect us on this daily basis.\u201d\n\nSamoylova moved to Florida in 2016, where she was struck by the state\u2019s severe weather events and aging infrastructure. She immediately began to document her new surroundings. Almost eight years on, \u201cFlood Zone\u201d feels more relevant than ever in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, the Category 3 storm that killed more than a dozen and left more than 2.6 million Floridians without power. Milton was the third hurricane in 2024 to make landfall in the state. But Samoylova doesn\u2019t call herself an environmental photographer. \u201cI\u2019m averse to labels,\u201d she said. \u201cI live in Miami and the choice of medium itself, to me, comes with the responsibility to reflect on our time. Otherwise, why photograph?\u201d\n\nSamoylova believes the medium of photography comes with a responsibility to \"reflect on our time.\" Currently, our time is defined by climate change. \"Crabbing, Georgia\" (2018) by Anastasia Samoylova. Anastasia Samoylova\n\nThe insidious, blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it approach to her observational photography is intentional. Several years of capturing political extremism, gentrification and environmental disintegration has given Samoylova time to think about how to package disastrous messaging. \u201cHow do you communicate these very complex subjects and make them relatable?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe trickiest part is to not make them off-putting.\u201d Come for the pink sidewalks that characterize the streets of Miami \u2014 as many tourists do \u2014 and stay for the subsequent feelings of existential dread. It\u2019s a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down, she says. \u201c(Climate change) is stigmatized, and it\u2019s become divisive, at least where I live in the US, especially in Florida. And who knows, it\u2019s likely going to be erased from the conversation again.\u201d\n\nBut beyond providing a record of Florida in crisis, there\u2019s also a dark poetry to her work \u2014 and plenty of space for creative interpretation. Samoylova\u2019s favorite pastime is haunting her own gallery installations, parking herself on a viewing bench or floating between visitors like a \u201cghost,\u201d and tuning in to how people are reading her pictures. \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling,\u201d she said, \u201cLeaving the work open enough to where people can discuss it on their own terms without supplying too much of a didactic narrative.\u201d\n\nOne image in particular is ripe for analysis. In \u201cGator\u201d (2017), an alligator floats above the viewer, suspended in murky, acerbic green water. While Samoylova took the photo at a nature reserve, holding the lens close to the gator\u2019s tank, there\u2019s no real context to the animal\u2019s surroundings. It could be anywhere \u2014 swimming through a flooded street or lying in wait beneath the surface of a flooded pool. \u201cIt\u2019s an allegory,\u201d said Samoylova. \u201cBecause they really do end up in people\u2019s pools like that,\u201d she said, adding that it felt like barely a month went by without a report of an alligator attack \u201cBut these beasts have been here forever. It\u2019s their native habitat, so we are the ones encroaching, not them.\u201d\n\n\"Park Avenue, Miami Beach\" (2018) by Anastasia Samoylova. Anastasia Samoylova\n\n\"Pool After Hurricane\" (2017). Samoylova's favorite pastime is listening to audience interpretation of her work. Anastasia Samoylova\n\nSamoylova sees something \u201cBallardian\u201d in the alligator photo, which she also chose to front her business card, particularly in relation to the British author J. G. Ballard\u2019s 1962 dystopian novel \u201cThe Drowned World\u201d which depicts a post-apocalyptic Earth consumed by water. \u201c(The alligator) is kind of ascending over you, and you\u2019re already on the bottom of that reservoir,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it feels like in Florida. I mean we\u2019re sitting here today and it\u2019s 29 degrees (Celsius) (84 degrees Fahrenheit). This is November.\u201d\n\nThe series \u2014 along with Samoylova\u2019s own personal perspective \u2014 is not supposed to be pessimistic, however. \u201cI remain, not really an optimist, but hopeful,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nHer next project, titled \u201cTransformations,\u201d explores that sentiment \u2014 focusing primarily on capturing the many climate solutions already being implemented across the globe. Anything counts: From solar panels and green roofing to urban gardens and corporate initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe need a bit of hope,\u201d she said.",

The proposed move was intended to combat the nation\u2019s labor shortage stemming from a declining birth rate and an aging population.\n\nAccording to Kim, South Korea\u2019s leisure culture is marked by a yearning for respite from the country\u2019s intense work pressures and fast-paced lifestyles.\n\nAt a public park in the South Korean city of Yangju, visitors take photos at a festival dedicated to the vibrant globe amaranth flower, which is known for its resilience and colorful blooms. Kim Seunggu\n\nKim, 45, started capturing these scenes in 2010, during his graduate studies. His project has taken him to the popular Jangheung Hanok Swimming Pool, its mineral waters set against the backdrop of a traditional Korean house; Royal Azaleas Hill, known for its blooming azaleas; Mulbit Park, which features tranquil nature trails; and various campsites in city parks across the country.\n\nAs a child, Kim observed the vibrant interactions of everyday people in their free time. As he grew older, he felt compelled to document them. \u201cI felt a newfound fascination with these scenes,\u201d he told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nThe photographer\u2019s series has garnered critical acclaim, earning him the Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Photography Competition and a shortlist nomination for the BBA Photography Prize Kim\u2019s work has also been showcased in prominent exhibitions at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art and the Seoul Museum of Art.\n\nHis upcoming book \u201cBetter Days\u201d features almost 50 photos from the series and delves deeper into themes of community, recreation and work-life balance.\n\nUnwinding at a water playground in Seoul's Mulbit Square. Kim Seunggu\n\nSledders enjoy the snowy conditions in Seoul. Kim Seunggu\n\nMuch like how 20th-century photographers unwittingly captured the fleeting moments of their time \u2014 Kim, who says he looks up to American color photographers like Richard Misrach and Joel Sternfeld \u2014 has emerged as a chronicler of modern Korean life, revealing the nuanced layers of joy and complexity that define it.\n\nThe art of finding locations\n\nIn many of Kim\u2019s photographs, bleak cityscapes loom in the background, while lively leisurely pursuits take place in the foreground, producing a stark contrast between the pressures of daily life and the moments of joy that punctuate it.\n\nIn his photograph of the Hanok swimming spot, Kim showcases a teeming pool framed by traditional Korean architecture of wooden structures and curved roofs, echoing a dialogue between past and present. Children splash in the water, their laughter almost palpable in the air. Parents lounge poolside in colorful swimwear, while others float on inflatable tubes.\n\nMeanwhile, in his photograph of Royal Azaleas Hill, pink blossoms dominate the scene, reflecting the significance of seasonal festivities in Korea.\n\nGunpo's Royal Azalea Hill in full bloom. Kim Seunggu\n\nKim\u2019s locations for \u201cBetter Days\u201d often focus on the middle class, rather than the upper echelons of Korean society.\n\n\u201cUpper-class people tend to be in luxurious, exclusive places that are inaccessible, such as high-end resorts or hotels, making it hard to observe their culture closely,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI believe that the culture enjoyed by the majority better represents Korean society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Joseon dynasty, genre paintings often depicted the culture of the common people, much like European genre painters who focused on local festivities and peasant life,\u201d he said, referencing the neo-Confucian dynasty that shaped Korean history from the 14th to the late-19th century. \u201cSuch depictions reveal a lot about the era, as upper-class life is often hidden behind layers of luxury, while the open culture of the common people reflects a modern folklore.\u201d\n\nUncovering cultural resilience\n\nTo better understand South Korea\u2019s unique leisure culture, Kim looked to its historical backdrop \u2014 particularly the cultural stagnation that followed the decades of Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War.\n\n\u201cIn the 1980s and \u201890s, the push for political reform \u2014 especially following the 1987 democratic uprising \u2014 sparked a strong desire for freedom and democracy. This led to the acceptance of Western cultures from America and Europe,\u201d he said. Kim added that the pursuit of individualism in Korea coexists with a sense of community, rooted in Confucian values, and a collective yearning for freedom stemming from Japanese occupation and dictatorial regimes.\n\nIn turn, Kim said, South Korean society became what he called a \u201cflexible community\u201d that blends individualism with mutual trust \u2014 and where gatherings among strangers are considered routine and safe.\n\nKim\u2019s photographs serve as a testament to a society that, while grappling with the pressures of long work hours and rapid modernization, finds moments of joy and connection. He insists his work does not directly address political issues, but when asked about various challenges facing South Korea today, from recent political turmoil to a deepening demographic crisis, the photographer said he considers society\u2019s \u201ccontradictions\u201d to be \u201cgrowing pains toward a better democracy and a better world.\u201d He sees these ideas as part of \u201cBetter Days,\u201d adding: \u201cKorean society has overcome many challenges through the power of its citizens, and the passion reflected in our leisure culture indicates the potential for improvements.\u201d\n\nA scene from a festival at the Salgoji Sports Park. Kim Seunggu\n\nOutdoor swimming at the Baekun Valley in Pocheon, South Korea. Kim Seunggu\n\nLong work hours and short breaks have led many Koreans to live close to urban centers, with over 80% of the population living in cities. And within Kim\u2019s photographs there is an intriguing duality \u2014 a tension between the oppressive cityscape and the colorful leisure activities of its residents.\n\nHe frequently employs vivid colors, high-angle shots and distant vantage points, capturing the broader context of social interactions.\n\n\u201cPeople may view the long hours and short vacations in Korea negatively, but I see them as a reflection of individuals adapting to and overcoming challenges, showcasing their diligence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe accept these contradictions to some extent, and within that lies a pursuit of satisfaction in leisure. This optimism is evident in Korean leisure culture, which I aimed to express through warm, bright exposures.\u201d\n\nSpectators gather for a performance by South Korean honor guard soldiers in Seoul. Kim Seunggu\n\nHe also stressed the importance of his creative process and commitment to \u201cslow photography,\u201d which demands patience as he often spends hours observing before capturing a single image.\n\nSomewhat ironically, his documentation of Korea\u2019s evolving leisure culture contains a strong work ethic.\n\n\u201cI plan to continue until I can no longer do so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBetter Days,\u201d published by Kehrer Verlag, is available now.",

A source with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday he had lost consciousness.\n\n\u201cIt is with great sorrow that we announce the news that today, 13 January 2025, our beloved Oliviero has embarked on his next journey,\u201d Toscani\u2019s wife Kirsti and three children said in the statement.\n\nThe photographer had revealed in an interview in August with the Corriere della Sera newspaper that he was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare and incurable condition that leads to the build up of amyloid proteins that affect the body\u2019s vital organs.\n\nToscani said he had lost 40 kilograms (88 pounds) in weight in one year and the newspaper published a picture of him looking sickly and emaciated.\n\nToscani, who was born on Feb. 28, 1942, followed in his father\u2019s footsteps by training as a photographer, studying in Zurich and working for a number of fashion magazines where he helped establish the careers of models including Monica Bellucci.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN's 2017 interview with world-renowned Italian photographer, Oliviero Toscani 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever he came to prominence in the 1980s as creative director for Benetton, the family-owned fashion chain based in northern Italy.\n\nToscani put images of a dying AIDS patient and the blood-drenched clothes of a soldier killed in Bosnia on to billboards around the world, stoking controversies that helped to popularize the \u201cUnited Colors of Benetton\u201d logo.\n\nA 1996 photo of a billboard in Milan, Italy, shows one of Toscani's controversial Benetton campaign posters. Luca Bruno/AP\n\nThe photographer left Benetton in 2000 after a furore over a campaign featuring images of US prisoners on death row.\n\nToscani and American freelance journalist Ken Shulman interviewed and photographed 26 prisoners awaiting execution in US jails in a campaign which read like a passionate manifesto against capital punishment.\n\n\u201cI exploit clothing to raise social issues,\u201d Toscani told Reuters in an interview at the time as the controversy raged over whether the campaign was a step too far.\n\n\u201cTraditional advertising says if you buy a certain product you will be beautiful, sexually powerful, successful. All that bullshit doesn\u2019t really exist,\u201d he said.\n\nHe resumed working for the group in 2017, reestablishing his partnership with Luciano Benetton, one of the company founders, who had returned to try and revive a brand that had been overtaken by nimbler players in the fast fashion sector.\n\nHowever, the Benetton group cut ties with him in 2020 after comments that played down the significance of the 2018 Morandi Bridge disaster which killed 43 people.\n\nThe bridge in Genoa was operated at the time by a unit of the Benetton family-controlled infrastructure group Atlantia.\n\nHis work was showcased in an exhibition in Zurich\u2019s Museum fur Gestaltung in 2024 entitled \u201cPhotography and Provocation.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nHistorical treasures hidden for decades have been uncovered in the crypts of a cathedral, with items including burial crowns and insignia belonging to Medieval European rulers.\n\nThe cache from Vilnius Cathedral, in Lithuania, has not been seen since the outbreak of World War II in 1939, according to a press release from Go Vilnius tourism promotion agency on Wednesday.\n\nItems include a crown belonging to Alexander Jagiellon, or Aleksandras Jogailaitis, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who lived from 1461\u20131506.\n\nOther artifacts include a crown, a chain, a medallion, a ring and a coffin plaque belonging to Elizabeth of Austria, or El\u017ebieta Habsburgait\u0117, who lived from 1436\u20131505.\n\nThe burial insignia were recovered from a hiding place where they were stored in 1939. Go Vilnius\n\nThere was also a crown, a scepter, an orb, three rings, a chain and coffin plaques associated with Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, or Barbora Radvilait\u0117. She was married to Sigismund II Augustus, or \u017dygimantas Augustas, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and died in 1551.\n\n\u201cThe discovered burial insignia of the monarchs of Lithuania and Poland are priceless historical treasures, symbols of the long tradition of Lithuanian statehood, signs of Vilnius as the capital city, and magnificent works of goldsmithing and jewellery,\u201d said Vilnius Archbishop Gintaras Gru\u0161as in a statement sent to CNN by the Vilnius Archdiocese on Thursday.\n\nThe artifacts would have been put inside the sarcophagi of the royals when they were laid to rest, and the crowns would not have been worn, instead being made after death to form part of the burial tomb, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the burial and honouring practices of the time,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cThis discovery is of particular importance for our statehood, as it shows the location of Vilnius Cathedral as the necropolis of the elite of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\u201d\n\nThe artifacts will go on display after being restored. Go Vilnius\n\n\u201cThese symbols are important both for the State and for each of us, as signs of European identity, as a reclaimed identity of the old State, as a sign of the strength of our roots,\u201d said Rita Pauliukevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, director of the Vilnius Church Heritage Museum, in the Archdiocese statement.\n\nThe items were first discovered in 1931 when the cathedral was being cleaned following a spring flood, revealing a crypt containing the remains of the rulers.\n\nThey were put on display until World War II broke out in 1939, when they were hidden. Several fruitless searches were carried out before researchers turned their attention to the crypts in September 2024.\n\nUsing an endoscopic camera, the artifacts were finally recovered in December, wrapped in newspapers dated September 1939.\n\n\u201cThey will be examined, restored and presented to the public in the future,\u201d according to the archdiocese.",

            "title": "Keyboard jackets and garden ornaments worn as bags: Welcome to the new maximalism movement",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCoco Chanel, possibly apocryphally, once said: \u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off,\u201d establishing the idea that, in her eyes, to be overdressed was a fashion faux pas.\n\nIt\u2019s a commandment that has informed many fashion houses for decades; take the monochromatic styling of Issey Miyake, or the clean leatherwork of Herm\u00e8s. Muted, neutral tones, simple silhouettes and chic fabrics have previously found favor in the fashion world thanks to the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d aesthetic, made even more visible by shows like HBO\u2019s boardroom drama \u201cSuccession.\u201d (HBO and CNN are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nYet recent runway shows by the likes of Valentino, Prada and Ashish indicate maximalist fashion \u2014 a style with roots as far back as 17th century Rome \u2014 might be staging a loud return. The economic timing certainly feels right too, as maximalism movements often bubble up around times of sustained economic hardship, such as the one gripping much of the post-Covid-19 world right now.\n\nAlessandro Michele's first collection as creative director of Valentino in September 2024 was maximalist's dream, with clashing patterns, textiles and overloaded accessories. Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of the 2019 exhibition \u201cMinimalism/Maximalism\u201d at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York explained it thus: \u201cIn the broadest terms, if we look back at fashion history, we can see alternating periods of minimalist and maximalist aesthetics in fashion. It is the back-and-forth nature of these two opposing aesthetics that propels fashion forward.\n\n\u201cEvery time an aesthetic re-appears it is not only expressing the social and political climate of the moment \u2014 it is also reacting to what came before it,\u201d Marra-Alvarez added. \u201cFor this reason, it\u2019s never the same iteration of minimalist or maximalist expression. It evolves every time.\u201d\n\nIndeed the current maximalist movement, popularized on social media, is more extreme and theatrical than ever before. It also brings the look to a whole new demographic that may not have previously experienced earlier iterations of the style.\n\nJaclyn posts videos of her building maximalist outfits on TikTok under the name @llolfashiondump. lolfashiondump\n\nHer eclectic, mis-matched style has garnered her a social media following of over 1.2 million. lolfashiondump\n\nJaclyn goes by @llolfashiondump on TikTok and has 1.2 million followers. In a Zoom interview with CNN, she said that, for her, maximalism is a way to be \u201clike a walking shrine of my art\u201d \u2014 it has become a physical embodiment of her creativity. Through her popular \u201cget dressed with me\u201d videos (which average 200,000 views and can sometimes reach up to 4 million people) Jaclyn challenges the conventions of clothing, wearing jumpers upside down, attaching various accoutrements and layering endless accessories. It\u2019s a style that at times seems cumbersome, presenting its own challenges and needing dedicated sewing techniques. Yet, she said, this is all part of the fun.\n\nMyra Magdalen is another prominent TikToker in the maximalist space, who joined a Zoom call with CNN wearing a top embroidered with an image of nail clippers. She has encountered similar issues with attaching heavier embellishments to her outfits, like dolphin lamps or computer mice. The solution? \u201cMultiple (points of) anchoring,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to attach something, especially if it\u2019s heavy, you need to have it where if one point of attachment fails it will not fall off.\u201d\n\nBoth Jaclyn and Myra enjoy experimenting with bold statement pieces like long nails and decorative headphones. But for those looking to dip their toes into maximalism, fashion stylist Kristine Kilty suggests picking up a statement piece from a thrift store and using the color palette to inform the rest of the outfit. Finding inspiration photos on social media can also combat some of the anxiety people might feel during their first foray into a more experimental style of fashion, said the creative director, who focuses on maximalism, over Zoom. Most importantly, she added, \u201cmore is more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really go wrong\u2026 It\u2019s not that the outfit isn\u2019t working. You just haven\u2019t finished it yet,\u201d she said.\n\nMyra's unusual outfits are often thematic and she regularly styles household items as fashion accessories. Myra Magdalen\n\nMyra's creative accessorizing have seen her fastening dolphin lamps to her shirt and headphones. Myra Magdalen\n\nWhen curating their wardrobes, the US-based Myra and Jaclyn both rely heavily on secondhand clothes, whether from in-person shopping in thrift stores or online platforms like Depop and Vinted. The algorithms have adapted to their unusual tastes, helping Myra find unique pieces \u2014 such as a jacket resembling a computer keyboard \u2014 to complete her looks. In videos styling these pieces, Myra takes a statement item, like a DIY duck bag, and adds seemingly-endless matching accessories including a duck-patterned skirt, a duck neck necklace and press-on miniature duck nails.\n\nBoth TikTokers say their creativity is well-received not only on social media but also in real life. While Myra and Jaclyn know when to dress down in jeans and a simple T-shirt, they enjoy the spectacle of wearing bold outfits in public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a positive feeling to have confidence in what you do,\u201d said Jaclyn, who admitted that her maximalist clothing originally acted as a mask for insecurities stemming from psoriasis \u2014 wearing unusual clothing blurred the reasons behind peoples\u2019 stares. \u201cIt radiates into so many other aspects of your life,\u201d she said. Myra\u2019s unique approach to fashion has also caught on among her friendship group which, she said, has become more experimental in its own sartorial choices.\n\nKilty strongly believes that people should use fashion to inspire confidence and creativity. \u201cFashion can be an armor or it can be a disguise,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ultimately, it\u2019s what you feel comfortable in.\u201d\n\nFor some, this might be sleek silhouettes in muted colors, while for others it\u2019s clashing colors and contrasting patterns. If the latter is you, Kilty had some parting words. Just \u201cgo really extreme \u2014 don\u2019t hold yourself back.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nOver the years, cameras have caught NFL players doing some memorable non-football things on the sidelines during games. Tom Brady once hurled an electronic tablet in frustration. Three members of the Seattle Seahawks were fined for eating hot dogs during a 1995 preseason game.\n\nOn Sunday evening in Philadelphia, as the Eagles hosted a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, wide receiver A.J. Brown did something arguably even more intriguing.\n\nHe sat down and opened a book.\n\nAs the Eagles ground out their 22-10 victory, cameras showed Brown on a sideline bench, studying a well-worn paperback. One of the Fox Sports broadcast announcers chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen too many people read books (during a game),\u201d he said.\n\nThe book is called \u201cInner Excellence: Train Your Mind for Extraordinary Performance and the Best Possible Life.\u201d It was written by Jim Murphy, a former professional baseball player and self-described \u201cperformance coach\u201d who helps athletes build mental toughness.\n\nBrown is one of the Eagles\u2019 best players. Only three passes went in his direction on Sunday, and he caught only one, for just 10 yards. Still, when he took questions after the game, he was cheerful.\n\nThis may have been the first time he\u2019d been reading on camera. But he said it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d read that book during a game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a book that I bring every single game,\u201d Brown said, adding that \u201cmy teammates call it \u2018The Recipe.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles receiver A.J. Brown, seen here during a January 5 game, says he brings the book to every game. \"It gives me a sense of peace,\" he said. Andy Lewis/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images/File\n\nSome passages were underlined and highlighted. Naturally, viewers were curious. The Eagles have a lot of fans, and the book quickly soared up the charts. On Monday afternoon, it was #1 on Amazon\u2019s bestsellers list.\n\n\u201cAs an outfielder in the Chicago Cubs organization, my sense of worth and identity revolved around my performance, mostly my batting average,\u201d Murphy writes in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cWhen I hit well, I walked tall and felt great. When I hit poorly, my shoulders slumped and my outlook was dark. Life was a roller coaster of emotions. I was a slave to results and it stifled my performance. I was afraid of failure and that fear kept putting my mind in the past and future.\n\n\u201cWhen I started coaching professional and Olympic athletes, I saw this over and over again: athletes had lost their joy and passion for life as they struggled under the pressure to perform. The fear of failure engulfed their lives.\u201d\n\nThe book has helped propel athletes to higher levels of performance even when they were filled with doubt, Murphy writes. \u201cBut far more than that,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou\u2019ll learn how to live with deep contentment, joy and confidence in your everyday life.\u201d\n\nBrown told reporters the book helps him refocus after every drive, \u201cregardless of if I score a touchdown or I drop a pass.\u201d He will get more chances next Sunday, when the Eagles host another playoff game.\n\nA reporter for Sports Illustrated reached Murphy by phone on Sunday night, as his book was suddenly going viral. Murphy said of Brown, \u201cIt\u2019s really an honor to be a part of his life and to have a meaningful place in anyone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the book had at least one new five-star Amazon review, from a user named Todd. The headline of the review said \u201cGo Birds.\u201d The full text of the review said, \u201cAJ Brown recommended this book, so I\u2019m looking forward to reading this. Fly Eagles Fly.\u201d\n\nAt least 1,044 people found Todd\u2019s review helpful.",

Her heart is with Los Angeles, as wildfires have been raging there for days.\n\n\u201cI was watching the fire map, and the fire is like three blocks from my house. So I had someone go and get my daughter\u2019s birth certificate and all that because I didn\u2019t know what would happen if that burned down,\u201d Osaka said in her on-court interview after her first-round win.\n\n\u201cSending all my love to LA. I know we hear about fires, but for me in particular, I didn\u2019t know how devastating it could be. I just hope everyone\u2019s doing well and I\u2019m sending them all my love.\u201d\n\nOsaka, seeking her third Australian Open title and first grand slam title since winning in Melbourne in 2021, later addressed reporters in a press conference wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey and a Los Angeles hat with a heart. She was asked about how she has kept her focus while knowing what\u2019s been happening close to her house.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been doing the greatest keeping focus, but obviously I won, so I think it\u2019s an acceptable job,\u201d Osaka said.\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult for me because I think it\u2019s tougher now because I find my home is more of a home because I have memories with my daughter, and there\u2019s so many things like keepsakes and stuff like that, and obviously you can\u2019t hoard them all when you\u2019re asking someone to go to your house and just grab stuff.\n\n\u201cSo it is really tough in that sense, and I\u2019m not there, so I don\u2019t know how bad it is or how bad it\u2019s going to get, but I think the biggest thing that I am grateful for is that everyone in my family is safe.\u201d\n\nOsaka said she\u2019s checking on the fire situation back home any chance she gets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go back to LA immediately after,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s safe enough to go back there, so it\u2019s kind of a little bit in a limbo, but also motivating me to hopefully stay here as long as I can.\u201d\n\n\u2018I love getting difficult draws\u2019\n\nOsaka\u2019s season got off to a promising start when she reached the final in Auckland, New Zealand. But after winning the first set 6-4 against Clara Tauson, Osaka was forced to retire because of an abdominal injury. It was her first final since returning from maternity leave 12 months ago.\n\nIn Melbourne, Osaka has a potentially daunting Australian Open draw ahead \u2013 with players she\u2019s familiar with.\n\nIt started with Garcia. This Australian Open first round, the pairing had the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but with a different result compared to 12 months ago. They have now faced each other three times at the Australian Open, including last year, with Garcia winning in 2024.\n\nOsaka passed the Garcia test and is now 3-2 in matches against her. In the second round, she\u2019ll face a tough opponent in Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1.\n\nMuchov\u00e1 beat Osaka in this same round last year at the US Open and went on to make a run to the semifinals.\n\n\u201cObviously I fell a little short in the US Open, but my outfit was spectacular,\u201d Osaka said with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping this time my tennis can shine a little bit better. And also, I love getting difficult draws, like I find that the most fun. It\u2019s kind of like once you get a difficult draw you can prove that you\u2019re the best of the best.\u201d\n\nShould Osaka get past Muchov\u00e1 , she potentially could face Belinda Bencic \u2013 also back from maternity leave \u2013 in the third round. A fourth round could be against Coco Gauff.\n\nIn head-to-head matchups, Muchov\u00e1 (2-1), Bencic (3-2) and Gauff (3-2) all have winning records against Osaka.\n\nThis is also the same half of the draw as world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking her third straight Australian Open title.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump has spent weeks preparing a shock and awe start to his second term.\n\nBut the new president will walk back into the Oval Office next week with a crisis over the raging wildfires in Los Angeles threatening to distract attention from his big moment.\n\nTrump\u2019s team is determined to get a fast start after learning the lessons of his chaotic first term, especially since the Republican monopoly on Washington power may only last two years. Swift border reforms, huge tax cuts and new incentives for oil exploration are already on deck. And the new White House, which is also expected to unveil a slew of early executive orders, has scheduled an Oval Office signing ceremony for Monday before Trump dons black tie for a trio of presidential balls.\n\nBut even if most of the flames are doused by Inauguration Day, the sudden prospect of finding billions of dollars in federal aid to rebuild miles of charred homes already threatens to complicate the task of passing Trump\u2019s agenda with a tiny GOP House majority determined to cut federal spending.\n\nTrump\u2019s rush to blame Democrats and progressive environmental policies for the catastrophe indicates his antipathy to fighting for federal cash for one of the bluest states in his first weeks in office.\n\nBut presidents don\u2019t get to pick and choose their crises.\n\nSo, Trump is considering a visit to Los Angeles in the first few days of his administration that would bring him face-to-face with two leaders he\u2019s already accused of causing the conflagration, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, sources told CNN on Monday.\n\nSuch a trip would allow Trump to try to establish a \u201cfix-it\u201d persona to cut through what he claims is the calamitous governance of progressives.\n\nAnd the devastating sight of the damage may bring home to the new president the enormity of the situation facing tens of thousands of people who no longer have anywhere to live.\n\nTrump told Newsmax Monday that the destruction in Los Angeles was \u201cfar worse than you even see on television.\u201d But the prospect of a massive real estate construction project did seem to appeal to the billionaire property magnate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do things with Los Angeles. You know, I\u2019m already putting my developer cap on,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPresidential trips to disaster zones can offer solace and unlock the power of government. An empathetic visit from the new president could create a strong impression and erase some negative perceptions of his first term among some Americans. But such photo-ops also establish a marker of the commander in chief\u2019s responsibility for a complex and costly relief project.\n\n\u201cThe president intends to go to California at some point,\u201d a Trump adviser told CNN Monday, adding that the specific timing is \u201cyet to be determined. Nothing has been finalized.\u201d\n\nA home is engulfed in flames as the Eaton Fire burns in Altadena on Wednesday. Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA firefighter battles a house fire from a residence next door as the Palisades Fire burns in Malibu on Wednesday. Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nHow Trump\u2019s disaster management failed during his first term\n\nThe Los Angeles wildfire catastrophe will also provide a personal test for Trump and his tolerance for acting as the president of all Americans.\n\nDuring his last spell in the White House, Trump sometimes suggested that he\u2019d break with established practice and withhold disaster aid to create political leverage against Democratic jurisdictions. He appeared to deeply resent sending hurricane aid to the US citizens of Puerto Rico, for instance, accusing \u201cinept politicians\u201d of using \u201cridiculously high amounts\u201d to pay off other obligations.\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s leadership was especially exposed when there was a clash between an emergency response and his own political interests. During the Covid-19 pandemic, his early commitment to mitigation efforts frayed when it became clear that the crisis and its impact on the economy could harm his 2020 reelection prospects.\n\nEven before the latest California wildfire crisis, Trump warned he\u2019d let the state burn unless Newsom fell in with his demands for changes in the way it manages its water. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t sign those papers, we won\u2019t give him money to put out all his fires. And if we don\u2019t give him the money to put out his fires, he\u2019s got problems,\u201d Trump said in California in September.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters may see this as a legitimate use of presidential power to force California to change environmental policies that the incoming administration regards as key to causing the wildfires.\n\nBut attempting to use the power of the federal purse to compel policy changes in cities and states is a recipe for political tumult.\n\nThe president-elect could turn out to be prescient if investigations show that local officials did not properly prepare for the scale of the fires. There are also likely to be lessons to be learned about the building of neighborhoods in areas with a high fire risk. But it\u2019s too early to say for sure what caused the disaster. And Trump\u2019s approach has been to cite conspiracy theories and misinformation in his angry social media posts in a clear grasp for personal political gain.\n\nPost-disaster probes are also likely to show that weeks of drought dried out vegetation combined with high winds to create a tinderbox for a perfect fire storm. Such conditions are being made more likely by the man-made warming of global temperatures \u2013 a phenomenon Trump denies. The president-elect, for example, reposted a social media photo of a burning neighborhood Monday from a follower that had the slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s not climate change. It\u2019s Democrats.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s claims that progressive attempts to preserve the environment and to save a rare fish \u2013 the delta smelt \u2013 led to water shortages that hampered firefighters has been debunked by fact checkers. Any decision to withhold aid for tens of thousands of people, many of whom have lost their homes, based on such falsehoods would be controversial and could damage his wider appeal early in his presidency.\n\nCalifornia leaders face tricky test with Trump\n\nThe president-elect\u2019s unpredictable nature will force California officials already under huge political pressure into a balancing act because they know that personal disputes with Trump could be counterproductive.\n\nNewsom has had a rocky relationship with Trump \u2013 exacerbated by his own potential presidential ambitions and California\u2019s status as a Democratic bastion with the power to challenge the president-elect\u2019s policies on everything from the environment to reproductive rights.\n\nIn a letter to Trump on Friday, Newsom recalled how they\u2019d worked together to help victims of a previous wildfire. But he also warned: \u201cWe must not politicize human tragedy or spread disinformation from the sidelines. Hundreds of thousands of Americans \u2014 displaced from their homes and fearful for the future \u2013 deserve to see all of us working in their best interests to ensure a fast recovery and rebuild.\u201d\n\nPaula Tapia hugs Katja Schmolka, who lost her home in Pacific Palisades on Friday. David Ryder/Reuters\n\nJohnson angers Democrats with suggestion of conditioning California aid\n\nWhile the fires still rage in Los Angeles, their political reverberations are now reaching Washington.\n\nPassing Trump\u2019s agenda while raising the government\u2019s borrowing authority was already certain to strain the smallest House majority in decades.\n\nThe idea of adding billions for California was weighing on GOP leaders Monday.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson raised the prospect of using disaster aid to enforce change or to exact punishment on Democratic leaders in California. He told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that \u201cit appears to us that state and local leaders were derelict in their duties in many respects.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there should probably be conditions on that aid. That\u2019s my personal view. We\u2019ll see what the consensus is,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said, adding that he hadn\u2019t yet had the chance to discuss the issue with any of his members. He also said that there had been \u201csome discussion\u201d about linking California aid to raising the debt ceiling \u2013 a step that must be taken within months to avoid an economic crisis caused by a US debt default. Such a move might be designed to coerce Democrats to vote to raise government borrowing authority since many Republicans may deprive Johnson of a majority on the issue.\n\nStill, withholding disaster aid is a touchy issue in Congress because each lawmaker knows that their district could suddenly find itself in need.\n\nDemocrats reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThis is a Mistake. If you start this, it will never end,\u201d Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz wrote on X. \u201cWhen Dems retake the House, they will condition aid to Florida and Texas. Disaster Aid must stay non partisan. I would fight Democrats should they try and do this. The Speaker can find many other ways to hold people accountable,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNew York Rep. Jerrold Nadler also offered a glimpse of the political battle ahead, writing on X that such funds \u201cshould NEVER be conditioned or used as a bargaining chip\u2014period.\u201d He added: \u201cUsing this tragedy for political points, then making it harder for people to get federal assistance? That\u2019s shameful.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This is the second of a five-part series that looks at how Donald Trump mounted the greatest comeback in American political history, how he is preparing for what he and his own team describe as a potentially tumultuous second term, and what all that might mean for those who support him \u2014 and those who don\u2019t. Read the first part here.\n\nCourt is in session at Mar-a-Lago, and it is the kind of court the owner likes.\n\nEven when he was president, Donald Trump seemed to prefer the golf shirts and sunshine of his Florida home over the formality of the White House, and a watchdog group clocked him making 134 visits to that private club and golf course during his first term in office. There, many observers noted, he basked in standing ovations when he walked to his private table for dinner. He greeted an endless stream of friends and admirers.\n\nAnd now, it is a river: Job and influence seekers, friends of friends, the rich, famous and powerful, even people who have paid members of the club to get them past the front door \u2013 all jockeying for any stray minute with the victorious president-elect. The list of those seeking an audience will grow to include some of the biggest names in business: Tim Cook from Apple, Sundar Pichai from Google, Ted Sarandos from Netflix, and Jeff Bezos from Amazon.\n\n\u201cI had dinner with almost all of them and the rest are coming,\u201d Trump will eventually say of his fellow billionaires, dryly noting the change in atmosphere. \u201cThe first term everybody was fighting me. This term everybody wants to be my friend.\u201d\n\nIt seems hardly coincidental weeks later, when Mark Zuckerberg of Meta decides to cut fact checkers from Facebook and Instagram \u2013 a feature right-wingers have often howled about.\n\nSome outside observers, such as CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta who covered Trump\u2019s first term, are watching the pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago skeptically. \u201cIt seems bending the knee is in for 2025. A lot of people think that will take you places, and it tends to lead to bad places\u2026 with Trump.\u201d\n\nStill, after the long months of campaigning, he is reportedly content to let the world come to him for a change. While loyal staffers scramble to simultaneously prepare for the transition and house hunt in DC, the boss is playing golf, talking to candidates for administration jobs, and meeting favor-seekers on the patio. \u201cHe\u2019s been very active, but he gets to do it from base camp. He\u2019s happy laying low right now,\u201d a Trump adviser tells CNN.\n\nAnd what better place to rock boats than a seaside town?\n\nA US Coast Guard boat patrols outside the Mar-a-Lago Club on November 8, 2024, near West Palm Beach, Florida. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs promised during his campaign, Trump is wasting no time laying out an aggressive, immediate \u2013 and for his foes, alarming \u2013 agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be at lightning speed,\u201d adviser Stephen Miller says of the coming changes on Fox News, noting the new White House team is \u201cprepared, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, to implement historical, transformative, long-awaited change to make this government accountable to the people of this country once again. It will be as Donald Trump said, a new golden age for America.\u201d\n\nOn his pledge to make the economy better and pull inflation down even further than President Joe Biden already has, Trump has a one-word answer: Tariffs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in tariffs,\u201d he tells NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in his first post-election network TV interview, echoing comments from his campaign. \u201cI think tariffs are the most beautiful word. I think they\u2019re beautiful. It\u2019s going to make us rich.\u201d\n\nMany who have shared Trump\u2019s orbit for years say he profoundly believes in the power of these fees imposed on goods imported to the US from other countries. He cites tariffs as an almost mythical fix for trade imbalances, loss of domestic manufacturing jobs, and a potential key to eliminating taxes up to and including the federal income tax. He likes to talk about the tariffs he launched during his first term, some of which the Biden administration maintained. \u201cI had a lot of tariffs on a lot of different countries, but in particular China. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and we had no inflation.\u201d\n\nThe problem? An overwhelming majority of economic experts say that last part is untrue, and most of Trump\u2019s ideas about how tariffs work are flatly wrong. For starters, since the cost is frequently passed on to consumers, in practical speak, tariffs are taxes. And an analysis by the non-partisan Tax Foundation of some of the tariffs Trump applied in his first term is damning:\n\nTrump instigated a trade war by imposing new tariffs (taxes) on imports of washing machines and solar panels\u2026steel and aluminum\u2026and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China\u2026throughout 2018 and 2019. Based on levels of trade before the tariffs went into effect, the new levies amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion a year.\n\nAnd while tariffs can increase federal government income, budget analysts widely agree even massive tariff hikes would come nowhere near replacing the taxes Trump has targeted.\n\nTrade experts broadly say the new tariffs Trump wants to slap on the US\u2019 biggest trading partners \u2013 China, Mexico, Canada and perhaps scores of other countries \u2013 could raise prices on televisions, smartphones, household appliances, furniture, clothing, cement, sporting goods, medicine and many more products. Analysts at the Yale Budget Lab predict Trump\u2019s new tariffs, if fully realized, could decrease the purchasing power of the average American family by $1,200 annually.\n\nYet Trump, who often says he trusts his gut over anything else, brushes aside the critiques. When asked about the cost consumers paid for his last term tariffs, he bristles. \u201cThey cost Americans nothing,\u201d he said in that December NBC interview. \u201cThey made a great economy for us.\u201d\n\nIn the days after his victory, that steamroller approach is applied to all his big priorities.\n\nHis promise to sweep up and deport 11-20 million undocumented immigrants (Team Trump widely disputes the lower, established number) is short on details and long on questions: How will these people be found? Where will they be held? How fast will this happen and how much will it cost? But Trump proclaims his first-day-in-office goal as if it is the easiest thing in the world: \u201cI want to close the border,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd his newly named border czar Tom Homan acts almost as cavalier. In his more nuanced moments, he suggests he will first go after dangerous criminals who have entered illegally. But he also feeds Trump\u2019s MAGA base with attacks on the idea of sanctuary cities and calls for families fearful of being split up by the Trump plan to self-deport en masse. \u201cThey put themselves in the position. We didn\u2019t,\u201d he tells CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. And despite the myriad challenges, Homan, like Trump, steadily talks this up as possibly the largest deportation in US history. \u201cI got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that Joe Biden has released into our country \u2026 you better start packing now,\u201d he said at a rally.\n\nAmid all the frenzy of planning in Florida, perhaps no players are viewed more curiously and skeptically than Trump\u2019s picks for remaking the government itself: the richest man in the world, Tesla and SpaceX impresario Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Those two have been chosen to head what Team Trump calls the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe DOGE duo initially promised to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget \u2013 almost a third of it \u2013 by eliminating waste, unnecessary jobs, regulations the administration sees as needless or counterproductive, and frankly who knows what else?\n\nElon Musk, right, carries his son on his shoulders at the US Capitol following a meeting with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, left, Rep. Kat Cammack, center, and other members of Congress on December 5, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nFor the MAGA nation, cutting big bad Washington down to size is a key tenet of their movement. At its core, DOGE is the tip of the spear for taking out bureaucrats. Many knowledgeable DC hands consider such people the backbone of the government. But in his first term, Trump was clearly irritated by workers he saw as constantly citing regulations, laws and customs that thwarted his instincts \u2013 the so-called Deep State.\n\nOn X, Musk has railed: \u201cThe power of the unelected Federal bureaucracy has grown to become an unconstitutional \u2018FOURTH BRANCH\u2019 of government! Especially with the creation of their own internal court system, it has become the most powerful branch of government. We must fix this!\u201d\n\nCritics suggest the two men don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. A massive share of federal spending is not merely protected by law but legally required on programs like Social Security and Medicare. There is simply no way DOGE can come even close to their wish list of cuts, according to California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren. \u201cThe impoundment of funds that have been appropriated by the Congress is unconstitutional and illegal.\u201d Furthermore, she adds, \u201cThere is no such \u2018Department of Government Efficiency.\u2019 It\u2019s made up. So good luck to \u2019em.\u201d\n\nNone of the pushback seems to slow the whirlwind, leaving Democrats more dismayed by the day. But then, their party is reckoning with other issues too.\n\nDemocrats confront their loss as finger-pointing begins\n\n\u201cA fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results.\u201d\n\nThe day after the voting, Kamala Harris is finally onstage at Howard University, doing what Trump never did despite his defeat in 2020. She admits her dash to hold the White House for Democrats has failed. Her gathered fans are despondent. She is defiant. \u201cWhile I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign.\u201d\n\nIt is an interesting choice of words because her party has another fight on its hands. Within hours of Harris\u2019 speech, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who twice sought the Democratic nomination, fires a blistering shot at the party\u2019s whole approach to the election. \u201cIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,\u201d he posts on X. \u201cWhile the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nOld guard Democrats rage against Sanders\u2019 assessment, but the blame game is underway.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party should have one simple mission,\u201d California Rep. Ro Khanna says on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cand that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans \u2014 not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats are convinced, after Harris inspired an initial blast of enthusiasm, that she retreated too quickly into safe, traditional campaigning, which was a poor match against Trump\u2019s bombast. Some say she refused to trumpet loudly enough the accomplishments she shared with Joe Biden, while others say with so many voters wanting change, she did not push Biden far enough away \u2013 pointing to her appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d when asked if she would have done anything differently over the past four years. \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind,\u201d Harris said, \u201cand I\u2019ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had an impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey blew it,\u201d says CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, who sees a host of problems and a standout issue that sank Democratic hopes. He cites a Gallup poll showing how 28% of voters wanted to decrease immigration in 2020, but now the number stands at 55%. \u201cThe first big error was the Biden administrations\u2019 blindness to the collapse of the immigration system and the chaos at the border,\u201d he says. \u201cThey missed a massive shift in American public opinion in just a few years.\u201d\n\nOthers say the bias against female and minority candidates played a role, or that the deluge of criminal cases against Trump triggered sympathy, or that anger over violence in Gaza suppressed votes that might have favored Harris. For Democrats, untangling the possibilities is painful and more so because Harris lost to a candidate so many Americans have told pollsters is deeply flawed, mistrusted and disliked.\n\nLegendary Democratic campaign guru James Carville, who had predicted a solid win by Harris, comes on CNN to admit his mistake and to talk about what must come next. \u201cIt\u2019s very depressing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re doing political strategy, you know, if you have an airplane crash, you\u2019ve got to go back and find out what went wrong. You don\u2019t say, well, let\u2019s just forget about it and move on.\u201d\n\nFor Van Jones, a CNN senior political commentator, some of the blame belongs to misplaced mechanics. Harris relied too much on a traditional plan of door knocks, TV commercials, and phone calls, he says, while Trump went rogue \u2013 flooding the internet with memes, pumping nonstop clickbait into millions of cell phones, and wallowing in non-traditional campaign stops such as that three-hour interview with Joe Rogan. \u201cWe were making fun of Donald Trump for having thrown away his ground game and doing some weird stuff online,\u201d Jones says. \u201cWe thought they were idiots. It turns out we were the idiots.\u201d\n\nThen again, some political observers wonder if the party might be over-correcting, because while Republicans are hailing their victory as monumental, the raw numbers tell a different story.\n\n\u201cI wrote them down and I have them on my bulletin board,\u201d says CNN\u2019s Acosta, pointing to the scrap of paper with scribbled figures tacked up behind his desk. They show Trump\u2019s total margin for victory in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin was just under 230,000 total votes out of more than 152 million cast across the country. Far less than 1%. \u201cHad Kamala Harris won those states, she would have won the Electoral College, and she would have won the presidency.\u201d\n\nBut of course, that is not what happened. Trump took every battleground and expanded his support in almost every demographic, including some where Democrats least expected it. Minorities, especially Latinos, drifted toward him over immigration and the economy, the very issues the Republicans at Mar-a-Lago are preparing to attack now. Young men bought into what many Democratic analysts had dismissed as Trump\u2019s hyper-masculine pandering. Red rural areas bent hard into their support, while unexpected shares of suburban and urban voters tilted toward Trump too. He didn\u2019t win in every district or state, but he boosted his numbers and blunted Harris\u2019 almost across the board. Her metrics expanded beyond Biden\u2019s only among college-educated women.\n\nStill, the race remained close. Sorting through all the math to determine where Democrats truly lost ground and Republicans truly gained will take time.\n\nKamala Harris pauses while speaking on stage as she concedes the election at Howard University on November 6, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some things we don\u2019t fully know yet,\u201d Harris strategist Dan Kanninen says as he warns against anyone holding too firmly on to the early assessments of what went wrong for his candidate. \u201cThe real person-by-person data that tells you, \u2018Did you actually have a spike?\u2019 That\u2019s not really going to be in place for Democratic campaigns and the voter action network until February or March.\u201d\n\nThat data may reveal that Trump re-aligned the electorate, or Kanninen notes, those numbers may show the race was pretty much a coin toss even at the end.\n\nAnother former Harris adviser, Ashley Etienne, is also not convinced the Democratic position was poisonous. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to throw away the baby with the bathwater,\u201d she says as she sorts through other possible factors. \u201cWas it a message issue? Was it a candidate issue?\u201d\n\nPerhaps, she argues, the ousting of the incumbent party in the White House was a relic of the long tail of the Covid pandemic. Or maybe Trump was just the right figure at the right moment with the right message \u2013 much like Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cThis is a little provocative,\u201d she says, stinging from the loss but, like Harris, looking for a way to not concede the fight. \u201cI think you study Trump. There is something to be learned from what he was able to do. Trump is more sophisticated, more astute, and more strategic than we give him credit for.\u201d\n\nRepublicans plan for Day One\n\nAll the woulda-coulda-shoulda by Democrats is just background noise for the incoming Republican juggernaut. Perhaps not even that. From the GOP vantage, the razor-thin election margins, anxiety about Trump triggering a whole new level of government dysfunction, and fears about the careening chaos of his ever-shifting worldviews are nothing. The fact he won is everything. Even all their hand-wringing over election security has vanished in the smoke of victory.\n\nFor the swirling storm of people around Trump as he prepares to move north from his exile in Florida and set up residence in the White House again, this is not the time for looking back, but for leaning forward, staffing up and drafting executive orders to batter the status quo. Where others see a date on the calendar \u2013 Monday, January 20, 2025 \u2013 Trump\u2019s true believers see a day of reckoning when a vast share of political power in the most powerful nation on Earth will fall into their hands.\n\nTrump will soon be inaugurated once again, the nation of their imaginings will be reborn, and this time it seems nothing can stop them.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWith just days left before handing over the keys to the US government, the Biden administration is making a last-ditch effort to seize hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian assets as future negotiating leverage for Ukraine, according to two senior administration officials.\n\nTop Biden aides have been working to convince European partners to support moving some $300 billion of Russian money into a new escrow account that would be released only as part of a peace deal. The money belongs to the Russian Central Bank and was initially frozen three years ago after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMost of that money is still being held in European banks, though a fraction remains in banks based in the US.\n\nSeizing the assets would be meant to send a simple message to Moscow, one senior administration official told CNN: \u201cIf you want your money back, you\u2019re going to have to come talk.\u201d\n\nSenior Biden officials have consulted closely on the idea with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s national security team, including Sen. Marco Rubio, his secretary of state designee, and Rep. Mike Waltz, tapped for national security adviser.\n\nThe Trump camp, according to people familiar with the matter, is generally supportive of the strategy, believing that the seized money could give Russia fresh incentive to come to the negotiating table, with Trump wanting to see a swift end to a war he believes has already gone on too long.\n\nThe Europeans, however, are not as keen on the idea and have raised concerns about violating international law if banks confiscate Russia\u2019s money outright.\n\nFor more than a year, US officials have worked to ease those concerns and find a way to use the frozen Russian money in a way that could benefit Ukraine. In a deal that was seen as a compromise, G-7 countries agreed last year to use interest that had accrued from the frozen investments, which generate a return each year of about $5 billion, as a loan to Ukraine.\n\nThe resulting $50 billion loan would be paid back by the investments\u2019 profit over a decade.\n\nWith just days to go before a transition of power in Washington, Europeans remain skeptical about confiscating the principle of the frozen Russian cash, sources told CNN, making it highly unlikely that any deal gets done before Trump assumes office.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy walk on the day of signing a new security agreement between the United States and Ukraine, in Fasano, Italy, June 13, 2024. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters/File\n\nSenior US officials suggested that Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party who is poised to become chancellor, is open to the idea of pursuing the strategy \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t taken office.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had expected to discuss the issue with Italian leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a meeting in Rome this week, which the US cancelled as the most destructive fire in Los Angeles\u2019 history raged across the city. Biden spoke by phone with Zelensky last Friday. It\u2019s unclear if the topic of the Russian money came up.\n\nThe White House has long been supportive of using the $300 billion in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and increase Ukraine\u2019s leverage. In recent meetings, Biden has personally broached the topic with G-7 leaders, a White House official said.\n\nIn its final weeks, the Biden team has looked for other ways to bolster Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield and its balance sheet ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration. The US last week announced new sanctions on secretive ships transporting Russian energy. That came a day after the White House said it would send a final tranche of $500 million worth of weapons, bringing the total amount of security aid for Ukraine to more than $65 billion.\n\nBiden officials have stressed that they want to leave the Trump administration with the strongest hand possible on Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Paris last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken again stressed that the outgoing administration wants to make sure that, if the Trump administration chooses to negotiate, that it would do so from a \u201cposition of strength and that President Trump could get the strongest possible deal.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly voiced his desire to quickly bring the war to a close. Blinken acknowledged that \u201cwe\u2019re at a point in the coming year where it may be that the parties will choose to negotiate.\u201d\n\nWhile the Biden administration has rushed to use as much of the money authorized by Congress to send to Ukraine, it will not have been able to disburse all of it before its term expires next week. There will be \u201cjust under $4 billion\u201d in funding from the Presidential Drawdown Authority that will roll over from the outgoing Biden administration to the incoming Trump administration for funding aid to Ukraine, according to a Defense Department spokesperson.\n\nAs for the G-7 loan program, the US committed $20 billion toward it and delivered its portion to the World Bank in December. But only $1 billion has been disbursed, with the rest to come on a World Bank schedule, according Ukrainian officials. To what extent the Trump administration could try to claw back the remainder if it hasn\u2019t been delivered is a cause for concern among Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe Kremlin called the $1 billion transfer theft and has repeatedly blasted the freezing of its assets.\n\n\u201cThis money was stolen from us, and the blocking of our assets is absolutely illegal, violating all norms and rules,\u201d Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last month.\n\nIn a recent interview, Zelensky said he told Trump to instead give the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to them to cement the strength of the Ukrainian military as a kind of security guarantee that Ukraine would want for agreeing to end the war.\n\n\u201cTake money, what we need for our interior production, and we will buy all the weapons from the United States,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need gifts from the United States. It will be very good for your industry, for the United States. We will put money there. Russian money, not Ukrainian, not European.\u201d",

            "title": "Defense pick Pete Hegseth repeatedly criticized removing names of Confederate generals from US bases",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of defense, has voiced strong opposition to removing the names of Confederate generals from US military bases, repeatedly saying the names should be changed back.\n\nHegseth, a National Guard veteran and longtime Fox News host, has described the renaming efforts as \u201ca sham,\u201d \u201cgarbage,\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d in various media appearances between 2021 and 2024 reviewed by CNN. Hegseth said the moves eroded military tradition and were part of what he characterized as a politically motivated progressive agenda infiltrating American institutions.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, the names of nine US military bases previously dedicated to Confederate leaders were changed, the result of the National Defense Authorization Act passed at the end of the first Trump administration. Trump initially vetoed the bill, partly in protest over the renaming provision, but Congress overwhelmingly overrode the veto to pass the bill in January 2021 .\n\nAs secretary of defense, Hegseth could advocate for reverting base names to their former Confederate names, but the changes would require congressional approval.\n\nHegseth, whose Senate confirmation hearings begin January 14, has criticized other cultural shifts in the military, including allowing women to serve in combat roles and gay service members to serve openly .\n\nHegseth did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDuring his 2024 book tour promoting \u201cThe War on Warriors,\u201d Hegseth frequently criticized the decision to rename military bases, calling it an erasure of legacy and tradition.\n\n\u201cWe should change it back by the way,\u201d he said emphatically while promoting his book when discussing North Carolina\u2019s Fort Liberty \u2013 previously Fort Bragg \u2013 on a podcast. \u201cWe should change it back. We should change it back. We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.\u201d\n\nFort Bragg, one of the largest Army bases in the US, was named for Braxton Bragg, a general in the Confederacy and slave owner who lost nearly every battle he was involved in during the Civil War. A naming commission set-up by Congress to study renaming bases noted Bragg is \u201cconsidered one of the worst generals of the Civil War,\u201d and was \u201cwidely disliked in the pre-Civil War U.S. Army and within the Confederate Army by peers and subordinates alike.\u201d\n\nThe base, originally Camp Bragg, opened during World War I and was named by locals for Bragg, the only Civil War general from North Carolina.\n\nThe base was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Army garrison commands organizational Fort Liberty flag waves after a redesignation ceremony officially renaming the military installation on June 2, 2023 in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Fort Liberty, formerly known as Fort Bragg, is the largest military installation by population in the United States. Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images\n\nTrump has been adamant in his opposition to renaming bases honoring Confederate leaders.\n\n\u201cI have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles,\u201d Trump said at the time of the legislation.\n\nHegseth\u2019s remarks are in keeping with a broader opposition expressed by incoming Trump officials to a range of cultural policies they view as overly progressive.\n\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the two billionaires tasked with slashing government waste, are expected to recommend an agency-wide purge of spending on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as CNN has previously reported.\n\nIn an interview with Megyn Kelly in early December, Hegseth gave a laundry list of DEI-related initiatives that he says Trump has told him to remove at the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cClean house of the woke crap,\u201d Hegseth told Kelly. \u201cAll that stuff. Climate stuff, the (critical race theory), the DEI and genderism. Get rid of it.\u201d\n\nAs CNN previously reported in December, Hegseth was once critical of allowing openly gay troops in the military \u2013 calling it part of a \u201cMarxist agenda.\u201d He has also expressed opposition to women serving in combat roles, describing it as detrimental to military readiness.\n\nSince CNN\u2019s report Hegseth has softened both positions.\n\nIn one interview in 2021 with Israeli podcaster Yair Netanyahu, the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hegseth argued that efforts to rename American military bases represented a trend of viewing the United States solely through the lens of its past sins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that view that America is defined by its sins of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the only lens through which you should view America is it was stolen from Indians \u2013 from Native Americans and built on the backs of slaves. Therefore, anyone who was a slave owner, anyone who was a part of, you know, didn\u2019t go far enough in their time should be canceled.\u201d\n\nHegseth took particular aim at retired Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accusing him of supporting the renaming efforts for political reasons.\n\nHegseth questioned why Milley, who previously commanded Fort Hood, did not raise objections to Confederate base names earlier in his career.\n\nHegseth\u2019s criticisms align with Trump\u2019s known hostility toward Milley, whom Trump has called \u201ca f**king idiot,\u201d and suggested could be executed for treason.\n\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he screaming about the racist base?\u201d Hegseth added on the June 2024 podcast. \u201cOh my goodness. How in the world am I gonna send troopers through basic training at a racist base? It must be changed. It\u2019s a sham. He showed up and he did it as a sham to kowtow to all the chattering class in Washington, DC, and he should be called out for it.\u201d\n\nIn another June 2024 interview, Hegseth referred to renaming the bases as \u201ccrap\u201d and \u201cgarbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI emailed my company commander from my infantry training, which was at Fort Benning, which is no longer Fort Benning,\u201d he said in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s Fort Moore. And Hal Moore\u2019s a great guy. But like, there\u2019s also a generational link that breaks when you rename Benning and Bragg. Like, where\u2019d you serve? Bragg, where\u2019d you serve Benning? Where\u2019d you serve now Liberty, like, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s garbage. It\u2019s all, it\u2019s just, let\u2019s just crap all over it.\u201d\n\nHegseth was discussing Fort Benning - now Fort Moore - named for Confederate Gen. Henry L. Benning.",

Job design, as defined by the study, includes elements such as the amount of technology used at work, levels of physical activity and work schedules, specifically the time of day when employees work.\n\nParticipants reported their sleep habits at the beginning of the study (2004 to 2006) and again a decade later (2013 to 2017) using six sleep health indicators: sleep duration, regularity, insomnia symptoms, napping habits, daytime fatigue and the time it took to fall asleep.\n\nTo track changes in sleep patterns over 10 years, the study identified three distinct sleep health categories: good sleepers, insomnia sleepers and catch-up sleepers.\n\nGood sleepers are those individuals who exhibit optimal sleep patterns, which include regular sleep cycles with low levels of daytime tiredness.\n\nInsomnia sleepers experience short sleep cycles and higher levels of daytime fatigue.\n\nCatch-up sleepers fall between these two groups and often rely on naps or extra weekend sleep to compensate for irregular sleeping patterns.\n\nWorkers operating on nontraditional schedules, particularly those working overnight hours, were 66% more likely to fall into the catch-up sleeper category because of their evening shifts. Smith noted that white-collar employees were more frequently categorized into the good sleeper or insomnia sleeper groups, whereas blue-collar workers were more likely to be catch-up sleepers because of their demanding shift schedules.\n\nEmployees who develop poor sleep patterns because of their job design are also at risk of dealing with these habits for years. Ninety percent of insomnia sleepers saw continuous symptoms up to 10 years later.\n\nInsomnia sleepers also face a 72% to 188% greater risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and frailty, according to another study coauthored by Smith.\n\nThe study\u2019s large sample size and statistical technique, which allows the volunteers\u2019 sleep patterns to be tracked over an extended timeframe, makes the research incredibly valuable, said Dr. Luis Buenaver, director of the behavioral sleep medicine program at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences.\n\nUnlike other sleep studies, which tend to focus on sleep quantity or quality, Smith said this research considered many factors that could provide a deeper understanding of common sleep problems.\n\n\u201cBy using this approach, we\u2019re able to gain access to a whole new population of people, (catch-up sleepers) who are having sleep problems that are typically ignored,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile the researchers expected extensive computer usage to worsen sleep health, they found little correlation between the two factors.\n\nWhile that\u2019s surprising given that devices are known to emit light that can be disruptive to sleep, Smith said the rise in technology use may offset these negative effects by increasing employee efficiency, ultimately protecting their sleep health.\n\nWhat you can do to improve your sleep\n\nSmall alterations to your daily routine could help with poor sleep patterns, including unplugging from your devices two hours before you go to bed. demaerre/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSmith acknowledges that switching careers to better align with sleep needs is unrealistic for most people. However, if possible, she recommends job crafting \u2014 making small adjustments throughout the workday to better align with personal needs \u2014 to address sleep issues.\n\nFor sedentary workers, these tweaks could include short breaks throughout the day to move. Quick bouts of physical activity such as briefly walking through the office may help you feel more tired at bedtime and help some people avoid sleep-disrupting musculoskeletal issues, Smith said.\n\nTo ensure you don\u2019t forget to take breaks, Buenaver advises people to set an hourly alert on their phone as a movement reminder. He added that taking the stairs instead of the elevator is another small way to add some more physical activity to your day.\n\nIf your job allows it, setting firm boundaries around work hours can prevent late-night tasks from disrupting your biological clock, which can lead to a reliance on catch-up sleep, Smith said.\n\nBuenaver recommends unplugging smartphones and computers two hours before bedtime to avoid disturbances and setting up a charging station outside of your bedroom to avoid the temptation.\n\nIf avoiding screens isn\u2019t an option, Buenaver suggests using the blue-light filter on your device to minimize the impact on your sleep.\n\nFor those working the night shift, Smith said employees may find relief by using light exposure to readjust their circadian rhythms.\n\nUltimately, Buenaver advises people who struggle with sleeping not to lose hope if they find themselves trapped in poor sleep habits.\n\n\u201cI want to send a positive message that you can change,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with little behavioral changes, they can amount to significant change if you\u2019re persistent.\u201d",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nFewer people are eating in a way they consider healthy \u2013\u2013 and they don\u2019t even like it, according to new data.\n\n\u201cIn some instances, we\u2019re still seeing strong majorities of people saying that they enjoy their food,\u201d said Andrew Dugan, consulting principal researcher at Gallup. \u201cBut the decline has been pretty stark.\u201d\n\nThe research, published Tuesday by Gallup, collected data from people across more than 140 countries regarding how they think about their food, including how healthy their considered it, how much they enjoyed what they ate, and how much food choice was available to them.\n\nGlobally, 81% of people said in 2023 they enjoyed their food in the past week, which was down from 87% the year before. And about 75% of people said they ate mostly healthy, compared with 82% in 2022, according to the survey.\n\nIn the United States in particular, the percentage of people who felt they ate mostly healthy foods dropped from 83% in 2022 to 71% in 2023, according to the data.\n\nResearchers cannot yet say why healthy eating and food satisfaction have been on the decline, but enjoying your food is key to other aspects of good, happy living, Dugan said.\n\nTaking even 10 minutes out of your workday to sit down to a meal can make a difference in how much you enjoy the food, said dietitian Natalie Mokari of Charlotte, North Carolina. Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nWhy is food satisfaction important?\n\nHaving a good meal is a gift that keeps giving, Dugan said.\n\nEating food you consider healthy and satisfying is connected to other indicators of a positive life rating, including feeling socially connected and part of a community, he added.\n\n\u201cPeople who feel good about their food, for the lack of a better phrase, also feel good about many other aspects of their life,\u201d Dugan said.\n\nThe connection appeared in the data, too. Younger people in Western countries reported less satisfaction in their food and the choices that they have available, and a similar age demographic has also rated their lives at a lower level than their older counterparts, he added.\n\nIgnoring the \u201csatisfaction factor\u201d of a meal \u2013\u2013 as dietitian Natalie Mokari calls it \u2013\u2013 is not helpful if you are trying to eat in a way you find healthy, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen we end a meal feeling satisfied, we\u2019re much less likely to engage in mindless snacking, looking for something else,\u201d said Mokari, who is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re both physically and mentally satisfied with a meal.\u201d\n\nHow to enjoy your food more\n\nBoth what you eat and how you eat it might contribute to how satisfying you find your meal, Mokari said.\n\nWhile it is essential to consider all the nutrients you want in your meal \u2013\u2013 like your fiber, proteins and carbs \u2013\u2013 determining whether you might need a drizzle of sauce on top to make it enjoyable also matters, she added.\n\nFood affordability and accessibility was shown in the data to be a huge barrier to enjoyment and satisfaction, Dugan said.\n\nWhen making your grocery plan for your meals, Mokari recommends trying to find affordable staples that you can find fun ways to make satisfying. Canned beans, for example, might be a low-cost way to make a meal feel a little more filling.\n\nThe rush of a busy life can make nutritious, satisfying food seem out of reach, so prioritize carving out time to plan and prepare food you like that will give you the nutrients you need on hand, she added.\n\n\u201cHave options available for a satisfying meal so you\u2019re not stuck scrounging for something and then disappointed whenever it\u2019s not very appetizing,\u201d Mokari said.\n\nThen, put down your phone before you settle in and enjoy your meal.\n\nWith a lot of her clients, the \u201csatisfaction factor goes down when we are distracted while eating,\u201d she said. \u201cMore often than not, people are eating and watching TV at the same time, scrolling their phones, or eating fast on the run. None of these are generally maximizing the satisfaction of a meal.\u201d\n\nOf course, competing demands on your time and attention are normal and is part of life, she said. But when you can, make an event out of your meal, she suggested.\n\nThe social factor of gathering over a meal is a big part of the Mediterranean diet, which is consistently rated among the healthiest ways of eating.\n\nMokari recommends being intentional about trying to take even 10 minutes out of your workday to dedicate to your meal. That approach means putting your phone down and resting your fork between bites. Pay attention to the color, texture, tastes and smells, she said.\n\n\u201cReally try to engage about the meal itself,\u201d Mokari said. \u201cTaking your lunch outside, getting new plates, new bowls, things that make you more excited about that meal \u2013\u2013 even those things can contribute to the satisfaction factor of a meal.\u201d",

            "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life\u2019s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here.\n\n(CNN) \u2014 The start of the year can be exhausting: After running yourself ragged over the holidays \u2014 hosting the perfect party, finding the right gifts or staging the ideal holiday mise-en-sc\u00e8ne \u2014 popular culture prods you to do even more. Enter the New Year\u2019s resolution, those self-imposed marching orders to improve yourself and, often, your health.\n\nBut sometimes the solution to better health \u2014 whether mental, emotional or physical \u2014 may be doing less and learning to let go, even just a bit.\n\nDr. Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist at Boston University\u2019s Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, author and a self-described perfectionist, finds doing less doesn\u2019t come naturally. And she is hardly alone.\n\n\u201cI would say most of my clients come in with perfectionism at the center of the overlapping Venn diagram of their challenges,\u201d Hendriksen told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his Chasing Life podcast recently.\n\n\u201cBut nobody ever says, \u2018Ellen, I\u2019m a perfectionist. I need everything to be perfect,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, what they say is, \u2018I feel like I\u2019m failing.\u2019 \u2018I feel like I\u2019m falling behind.\u2019 \u2018I should be so much farther ahead than I am now.\u2019 \u2018I have a million things on my plate and I\u2019m not doing any of them well.\u2019 And ultimately, I think that\u2019s because perfectionism is a little bit of a misnomer; that instead of striving to be perfect, it\u2019s really about never feeling good enough.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the full episode of the podcast here.\n\nPerfectionism \u201ccan look like striving for excellence for the sake of excellence, for setting high standards, working hard, caring deeply,\u201d Hendriksen said, noting those are positive attributes. It is a huge asset for many professions \u2014 say, for a pilot or brain surgeon \u2014 but it can tip over into unhealthy behavior.\n\nHendriksen should know. She said she wrote her most recent book, \u201cHow to Be Enough: Self-Acceptance for Self-Critics And Perfectionists,\u201d for herself.\n\n\u201cThere is a saying for self-help book authors, which is, \u2018Write the book you need.\u2019 So I did write it for me. But as a clinical psychologist at an anxiety specialty center, I also wrote the book for everybody else like me.\u201d\n\nPerfectionism is at the heart of many medical and mental health challenges, Hendriksen said. \u201cAnd it also is a really central component of eating disorders, of a lot of kinds of depression, of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder).\u201d She said it even \u201creaches its tendrils\u201d into conditions you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily think of, such as migraines, erectile dysfunction and panic attacks.\n\n\u201cFor me, it manifested physically,\u201d she said. \u201cI developed a GI (gastrointestinal) illness. I went through like five rounds of physical therapy. I had an overuse injury from typing too much. I woke up one morning, and I couldn\u2019t turn my head to the right because my muscles were too tight.\u201d\n\nHendriksen said perfectionism has several sources: It can be genetic, come from the family environment or stem from Western culture, where capitalism, consumerism and social media dominate. The pandemic, she said, made it worse.\n\n\u201cPerfectionism is essentially the result of being in an economic system that is hell-bent on exceeding human thresholds,\u201d she said, citing the work of psychologist and perfectionism researcher Dr. Thomas Curran. And studies show that the rate of perfectionism is going up, especially among young people.\n\nHendriksen said you don\u2019t have to lower your standards or be less driven to loosen the vice grip of perfectionism on your psyche. Here are her five tips to ease up on yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re not your achievements\n\nThere is value to you beyond your accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWe all identify with our performance,\u201d Hendriksen said in an email. \u201cOf course we\u2019re proud of good grades, an excellent job review, hitting our workout goals, or even turning out a killer new chocolate chip cookie recipe.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s natural to feel bad or disappointed when falling short of your goals. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we are not defined solely by our performance,\u201d she said.\n\nConflating performance with self-worth, Hendriksen said, is called overevaluation, which can lead to fluctuating self-esteem \u201cthat results when every performance becomes a referendum on our worth.\u201d\n\nShe wants to remind people they\u2019re so much more than their outcomes. \u201cWe are our relationships, our interests, our values, our enjoyment of life,\u201d she pointed out.\n\nTone down your inner critic\n\nTake your critical brain less seriously, Hendriksen said.\n\n\u201cThose of us who aim high, work hard, and care deeply take things seriously. We take our commitments seriously, our responsibilities seriously. But that means we also take our own thoughts very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we think \u2018I\u2019m not good enough,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m falling short,\u2019 we assume those thoughts are true. We treat them as fact. But actually, they\u2019re just thoughts.\u201d\n\nHendriksen said that some people are simply wired to be self-critical. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have to take every thought seriously and literally. Take the stance of listening to your self-critical thoughts as you would listen to the music playing in the background at a coffee shop,\u201d she advised. \u201cIt\u2019s there. You can hear it. But you don\u2019t have to get wrapped up in it or let it yank you around.\u201d\n\nMake self-compassion easier\n\nSelf-compassion is often described as \u201ctalking to yourself like a good friend,\u201d Hendriksen said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to feed yourself a steady stream of self-compassionate hype.\u201d\n\nShe said self-compassion can be one word or a phrase: \u201c\u2018Easy,\u2019 \u2018Gentle,\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re OK,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEven easier? Self-compassion can be actions: three deep breaths, asking for help, taking a break, taking time to savor your coffee in the morning or read a novel before bed.\u201d\n\nIt can also be permission not to do all the things you expect of yourself, Hendriksen said. \u201cSelf-compassion can be permission to skip the gym because what you really need is an extra hour of sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cAll in all, self-compassion is turning toward your pain and suffering with care and understanding and asking, \u2018What do I need? What would work for this situation?\u2019\u201d\n\nLet your inner sloth out\n\nDare to be unproductive, Hendriksen said.\n\n\u201cSelf-improvement feels good. But resist the urge to be endlessly productive with your leisure time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to build a skill, learn something new, or do something \u2018good for you\u2019 all the time.\u201d\n\nAlso, do things you like, not because you should do them. \u201cIf your heart sings when reading non-fiction history, absolutely read history. If you love running, please run,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you think you \u2018should\u2019 read history or \u2018it would be good\u2019 to go running, allow yourself to reflect. Improvement and personal development are important, but so are pleasure, enjoyment, connection and expression.\u201d\n\nSo, go ahead and indulge in so-called unproductive pursuits: \u201cRead a rom com, watch a gross-out comedy, spend an hour doing nothing but singing to your cat,\u201d she advised. \u201cIf you love it (assuming it\u2019s safe and respectful), you\u2019re doing it right.\u201d\n\nDo good work for the right reasons\n\nKeep your high standards, but focus on the work, not yourself, Hendriksen said.\n\n\u201cImperfection is having a moment in our culture, which provides much-needed relief from ever-escalating standards,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the advice around imperfection tends toward \u201cstop when things are good enough,\u201d or \u201cyou need to lower your standards,\u201d Hendriksen noted, which can feel fraught and risky for many.\n\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019re not going to settle for subpar or mediocre outcomes because that would mean that we ourselves are subpar or mediocre,\u201d she said. \u201cSo keep your high standards. But focus on the work, not yourself. Take the stance of a sculptor eyeing a block of marble and ask, \u2018What would make this thing better?\u2019 \u2018What would make the work better?\u2019\n\n\u201cKeep your focus squarely on the work. Don\u2019t extrapolate it into a referendum on your character.\u201d\n\nWe hope these five tips help you ease up on perfectionistic tendencies. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast to examine the purpose of boredom.",

            "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Dana Santas, known as the \u201cMobility Maker,\u201d is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book \u201cPractical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.\u201d\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, when you hear the word core, you probably think of six-pack abs. But your core is so much more than that \u2014 it\u2019s the powerhouse that stabilizes, supports and moves you through life.\n\nDespite its central role in your body\u2019s physical function, the core is often misunderstood and poorly targeted in workouts. Many people focus on achieving a sculpted appearance while neglecting other critical aspects such as mobility and stability. A truly healthy core is about function \u2014 not just form \u2014 supporting your body in accomplishing both daily tasks and athletic feats.\n\nWhether you want better balance, more powerful movements, or fewer backaches and injuries in the new year or any time of year, your core holds the key. Read on to learn why core health matters and how to train your core effectively.\n\nWhat is your core?\n\nYour core is an interconnected group of muscles that includes all your abs \u2014 not just your rectus abdominis, the long vertical muscle that can appear as a visible six-pack in people with low body fat. And because your core wraps around the entire midsection of your body, it also includes your side waist, pelvic floor and lower back muscles as well as your diaphragm, your primary respiratory muscle that runs from your rib cage to your lumbar spine. Together, these muscles form a fundamental support system, enabling nearly every move you make and every breath you take.\n\nThe core\u2019s role in movement\n\nAs a mobility coach in professional sports, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how core integration is essential for nearly every physical action. Your core isn\u2019t just along for the ride \u2014 it\u2019s the driver, ensuring strength, stability and efficiency in movement.\n\nWhether you\u2019re walking, lifting or playing a sport, your core plays a pivotal role in your body\u2019s key functions. Here\u2019s how:\n\nStabilization and balance: Your core stabilizes your spine and pelvis and influences rib cage position, creating a foundation for posture and movement. This stability is crucial not only for athletic performance but also for ensuring the ability to maintain neutral posture and balance to prevent injuries. For example, standing on one leg or walking on an uneven surface both rely on your core to keep you upright and stable.\n\nMovement in all directions: While stability is crucial, your core also needs to be mobile. Imagine twisting to grab something from your car\u2019s back seat or reaching into your grocery cart to place items on the checkout conveyor belt \u2014 both movements require core mobility. A stiff or inflexible core can limit your range of motion and increase your risk of injury. I see this limitation lead to injury all too often in rotational athletes when they focus too much on anterior core strengthening and not enough on mobilization.\n\nPower transmission: Whether you\u2019re throwing a football, swinging a golf club or sprinting, your core allows for the efficient expression of power through your limbs. Without a stable core, this power transfer is less effective, putting more stress on your joints, which can lead to compensation and overuse injuries, especially for athletes. In my experience, this is a common cause for tennis elbow.\n\nThe plank: A foundational core exercise\n\nCrunches have a long-standing history as the gold standard of ab exercises. But, unlike crunches, which isolate your rectus abdominis, planks activate your entire core, from your deep stabilizing muscles to your obliques and lower back.\n\nImportant note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nHow to do a basic plank\n\nMobility coach Dana Santas demonstrates the straight-arm plank, without modifications, which works the entire core. Aaron Lockwood\n\n1. Start on your hands and knees with your wrists aligned under your shoulders.\n\nGaze slightly ahead of your hands to keep your neck in a neutral position.\n\n2. Step your feet back one at a time, straightening your legs to create a diagonal line from your head to your hips and down to your heels.\n\n3. Engage your core by exhaling and moving your ribs back and down toward your waist. Avoid letting your hips sag or back arch.\n\n4. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds to start, maintaining a deep, even breathing pattern. Rest for 10 to 15 seconds in between reps and repeat two to three times. Gradually increase the duration of holds as your strength improves.\n\nIf a traditional straight-arm plank is too taxing on your wrists or shoulders, modify with a forearm plank by putting your forearms down with your elbows aligned under your shoulders. Likewise, if having your legs straight is too difficult, drop down to your knees.\n\nPlank variations add well-rounded benefits\n\nAlmost every exercise imaginable requires core activation to be safe and effective, but the plank stands out as a foundational core exercise because it not only enables full core muscle activation but also provides a base for variation to increase emphasis on specific areas and benefits. Adding dynamic movements \u2014 such as shoulder taps or mountain climbers \u2014 emphasizes integrated strength and mobility, while variations, such as a side plank, target your obliques and challenge your balance.\n\nOne of my favorite side plank dynamic progressions is adding a reach-and-rotate movement, which covers the bases of stability, mobility and strength. To perform this, from a side plank, reach your top arm under your body as if threading a needle, then rotate it back upward toward the ceiling.\n\nNo matter what variants of plank you choose or other core-focused exercises, always round out your core training with mobility exercises that rotate and stretch your core in all directions. You can easily accomplish this with some basic yoga twists and bends.\n\nCore health for everyday life\n\nA well-functioning core is not just for athletes. It\u2019s essential for everyone.\n\nBut building a healthy core does not mean spending hours in the gym. You can build a stronger, more resilient core with a few minutes of targeted exercises a few times a week.\n\nBy practicing a mix of static holds, dynamic exercises and rotational movements, such as those mentioned above, over time, you will notice improvements not just in your core strength, but in how you move, perform and feel in everyday life.\n\nWant to build on your core strength in 2025?

            "text": "Los Angeles CNN \u2014\n\nJust hours after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg announced last Tuesday that the social media giant would eliminate its US-based fact-checkers, the iconic hills above Los Angeles began to smolder.\n\nAs fire crews scrambled in vain to contain the resulting firestorm, the fact-checking partners, still working for Meta, took on their own fight: trying to slow viral misinformation rapidly spreading around the wildfires.\n\nRumor and speculation about the disaster began to swirl online like glowing embers, before eventually becoming a wild blaze of vast conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cCutting fact checkers from social platforms is like disbanding your fire department,\u201d said Alan Duke, a former CNN journalist who co-founded the fact-checking outlet Lead Stories, one of dozens of such organizations around the world funded by Meta.\n\nMeta has not announced when it will formally end its fact-checking program, but a person familiar with the program said it could be eliminated as soon as March. The decision will force some of Meta\u2019s fact-checking partners to lay off staff or shut down once the company\u2019s financial support dries up.\n\nDuke, a Los Angeles resident, could see the orange glow of the fires from his home as he and his colleagues at Lead Stories worked to tackle conspiracy theories about the blazes that have left at least two dozen people dead.\n\n\u201cFires and looting. A regular Democrat run city,\u201d read the caption on an Instagram video showing men removing a television from a home amid the fires.\n\nAfter Lead Stories fact-checked the claim and found that the men were not looters, but in fact the resident\u2019s family helping save their belongings, Meta placed a fact-check label on the video. When a post is labeled as false or misleading, Meta says it applies penalties that \u201csignificantly reduce that content\u2019s distribution so that fewer people see\u201d it and also notifies users who try to share the post.\n\nPolitiFact, the Florida-based Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-check organization that also is part of Meta\u2019s program, debunked a viral post on Threads falsely claiming Los Angeles police were \u201clooking for three \u2018persons of interest\u2019 all tied to a MAGA website who were spotted at the source of all three major LA fire.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact also debunked an image circulating on Instagram that purported to show the iconic Hollywood sign on fire. PolitiFact said the false image was likely created using artificial intelligence.\n\nMuch of the misinformation swirling online was of a distinctively partisan nature and spread beyond Meta\u2019s platforms by some of the most widely followed and influential figures on the internet.\n\nFalse claims promoted by President-elect Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform sought to blame the Democratic Party for the wildfires. On X, Elon Musk downplayed the role of climate change while repeatedly blaming diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies for the fires. \u201cDEI means people will DIE,\u201d Musk posted.\n\nThe disgraced conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed on X that the fires were \u201cpart of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Musk wrote in a response to Jones.\n\nLike the devastating Maui wildfires in 2023 and Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, conspiracy theorists claimed the Los Angeles fires had been deliberately set by the government. Some baselessly suggested the government was controlling the weather and directing strong winds to spread the fires.\n\n\u201cThe false claims we are seeing on the wildfires are similar to what happened with the recent hurricane that slammed the southeast a few months ago. It creates distrust of emergency agencies that are actively responding to the disaster, making it more difficult for them during the crisis,\u201d Duke told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe same thing happened after the Maui fires in 2023,\u201d he added. \u201cSpace lasers were blamed. It was allegedly a conspiracy to steal the land. Unless the false claims are countered with facts collected and assessed by professionals, the myths and distrust will continue to spread.\u201d\n\nBut removing professional fact-checkers from the equation is precisely what Zuckerberg intends to do.\n\nIn his announcement last Tuesday, the billionaire said he planned to replace the fact-checking program that was created in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2016 election with something similar to X\u2019s Community Notes feature. Community Notes is a crowd-sourced form of fact-checking where the platform\u2019s users can append notes to debunk or provide further context to posts.\n\nCommunity Notes only appear on posts when X users with \u201cdiverse perspectives\u201d agree a post warrants one, the Musk-owned company outlines in a somewhat obscure explanation on its website.\n\n\u201cCommunity Notes doesn\u2019t work by majority rules. To identify notes that are helpful to a wide range of people, notes require agreement between contributors who have sometimes disagreed in their past ratings. This helps prevent one-sided ratings,\u201d the company says.\n\nUnlike fact-checking journalists, however, community users are not bound by ethical guidelines to provide fair and accurate assessments. Fact checks in the form of Community Notes have been added to posts on X, including on a video with more than 500,000 views that falsely purported to show the fire approaching the Hollywood sign (An assessment by Lead Stories found the video was likely created using artificial intelligence).\n\nAnother Community Note offered a robust fact-check of a post from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about the fire that played into conspiracy theories about the government\u2019s ability to control the weather.\n\nBut other posts baselessly suggesting the fires had been planned by the government, started using lasers, and spread through weather manipulation have gone unchecked on X.\n\nAlex Jones\u2019 baseless claim that the fires are part of a \u201cglobalist plot\u201d has not been marked with a Community Note and as of Sunday had been viewed more than 17 million times.\n\nAngie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, whose members are part of the Meta fact-checking program, told CNN that while Community Notes has had some success, it is no substitute for professional fact-checks.\n\n\u201cProfessional fact-checkers can tackle a wider variety of complex conspiracy theories and political claims, while community-based systems excel mainly at flagging obvious visual misattribution,\u201d Holan said.",

            "title": "Biden unveils last round of AI chip curbs aimed at China, Russia",
            "text": "Washington/Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nThe Biden administration has issued new restrictions on the export of US-developed computer chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) systems, in a final effort to prevent rivals like China from accessing the advanced technology, just a week before leaving office.\n\nThe fresh curbs, the culmination of years of attempts to block China from gaining ground in its military and industrial leadership efforts, are expected to further inflame tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump next week. They\u2019ve also triggered intense criticism from US tech giants like Nvidia and Oracle.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the new rules were \u201cdesigned to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries, but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\u201d\n\nThe global export framework, announced Monday, creates three tiers of countries for exports of advanced AI chips and technology. There are no new restrictions for partners and allies like Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nA second tier of countries including China and Russia, which are already blocked from buying advanced chips, will be newly subject to restrictions on the sale of the most powerful \u201cclosed\u201d AI models, which refer to models whose underlying architectures are not released to the public.\n\nThe biggest changes will be faced by the third group, which comprises most of the world, which will soon have new caps on the amount of computing power that can be bought, although they will be able to apply for additional quotas subject to certain security requirements. Analysts have said this change is intended to prevent China from accessing AI chips through third countries, particularly in the Middle East.\n\nThe restrictions are being announced against a global backdrop of soaring demand for AI chips made by the likes of Nvidia, AMD and Intel. With days to go before Biden leaves office, the rules now enter a 120-day comment period but will take effect before that period is over.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the next administration takes full advantage of those 120 days to listen to experts, industry, industry players, partner countries,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cI fully expect the next administration may make changes as a result of that input.\u201d\n\nSenior Biden administration officials, speaking on background, were asked Sunday about the extent to which they consulted with the incoming Trump administration. Officials would only acknowledge there were \u201congoing discussions about a range of issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019re in a critical window right now, particularly vis-a-vis China,\u201d one official said. \u201cEvery minute counts from our perspective.\u201d\n\nThe latest measures were announced just a month after the outgoing administration announced curbs on the sale of two dozen types of semiconductor-making equipment and restrictions on numerous Chinese companies from accessing American technology.\n\nSince October 2022, the administration has announced several rounds of semiconductor export restrictions targeting Beijing. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made self-sufficiency a major pillar of his economic strategy to make China a tech superpower.\n\n\u2018In jeopardy\u2019\n\nTech giants Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest provider of processors that power AI, and Oracle as well as an influential semiconductor industry group blasted the newest restrictions, accusing the Biden administration of bureaucratic overreach and saying they would harm US competitiveness.\n\nIn a blog post published on Monday, Ned Finkle, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of government affairs, wrote the adoption of AI around the world fuels growth and opportunity for industries at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThat global progress is now in jeopardy. The Biden Administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided \u2018AI Diffusion\u2019 rule which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile cloaked in the guise of an \u2018anti-China\u2019 measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance US security,\u201d he added.\n\nOracle Executive Vice President Ken Glueck wrote last week the rule \u201cdoes more to achieve extreme regulatory overreach than protect US interests and those of our partners and allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt practically enshrines the law of intended consequences and will cost the US critical technology leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the unprecedented scope and complexity of this potential regulation, which was developed without industry input and could significantly undercut US leadership and competitiveness in semiconductor technology and advanced AI systems.\u201d",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nTikTok\u2019s fate in the United States is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. And things are not looking good for the app.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday heard oral arguments over the law that could ban TikTok in the United States. The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, requires TikTok to be sold off from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a US ban.\n\nThe hearing did not seem to go well for TikTok, making it more likely than ever that the ban will go into effect starting on January 19. Most of the justices appeared likely to uphold the law, lobbing tough questions at lawyers for TikTok and its users about the relevance of their argument that the law violates the First Amendment.\n\nThere are a lot of lingering questions about how the ban would work in practice because there\u2019s no precedent for the US government blocking a major social media platform. And much of how the government plans to enforce it remains unclear.\n\nEven TikTok attorney Noel Francisco seemed uncertain about how exactly a ban would go down. \u201cOn January 19, as I understand it, we shut down,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond being unavailable in the app stores, \u201cwhat the act says is that all of the other types of service providers can\u2019t provide service either,\u201d Francisco said. \u201cSo essentially what they\u2019re going to say is that, I think, \u2018we\u2019re not going to be providing the services necessary to have you see it.\u2019 So it\u2019s essentially going to stop operating. I think that\u2019s the consequence of this law.\u201d\n\nTikTok itself said in its emergency filing to the Supreme Court that if the court doesn\u2019t block the law, it \u201cwill take effect on January 19, 2025, shutting down TikTok for its more than 170 million monthly American users.\u201d\n\nBut some things are clear, including the fact that TikTok won\u2019t suddenly disappear from existing users\u2019 phones.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about how a ban would work.\n\nRemoved from app stores\n\nTechnically, TikTok could take its ball and go home, blocking access to the app for American users itself, as a way of rebuking the US government and strengthening its bargaining position with the support of millions of newly irate people, bereft of their beloved TikTok. But given how hard it\u2019s fought to avoid a ban, it\u2019s more likely the US government will have to act to enforce the law.\n\nIt is widely expected that the US government will force app store operators, like Google and Apple, to remove TikTok from their platforms.\n\nThat would mean new users won\u2019t be able to download it. TikTok\u2019s existing American users could still use the app on their phones, but they won\u2019t be able to update it via the app stores, meaning the company won\u2019t be able to fix bugs or security holes. And either of those can add up, eventually making the app difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to use.\n\n\u201cPotentially, vulnerabilities will become known in the app, and hackers will take advantage of those vulnerabilities to compromise your account or your device,\u201d Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNN\u2019s Terms of Service podcast.\n\n.Still, it could be weeks or months before existing users see their experience on the app degrade.\n\nThe government could also force American internet service providers (ISPs), which provide access to the internet and the websites on them, to block TikTok, making it impossible to access the web version of the platform. But that approach would be complicated, Galperin said, because there are many more ISPs than app stores.\n\nCould you get around a ban?\n\nRegardless of the precise route the government takes to block TikTok, there will almost certainly be ways around it, for example, by using a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN is a program anyone can download that can hide location data and make it appear as though the user is accessing the internet from a different country.\n\n\u201cMany other countries have blocked social media apps and websites in the past using a variety of different methods, with a very wide range of results and levels of effectiveness,\u201d Galperin said. \u201cIn Turkey, for example, a lot of social media sites have been blocked for years, and having a VPN that gets around that censorship is something that nearly every single person in Turkey does.\u201d\n\nEven if the ban does go into effect, it\u2019s not necessarily permanent. ByteDance would still have the option to sell the platform to a non-Chinese owner to restore access for American users.\n\nAnd there are willing buyers. A group created by billionaire Frank McCourt and backed by Shark Tank-famous investor Kevin O\u2019Leary said Thursday they made a formal bid to ByteDance to acquire TikTok\u2019s US assets, although the company has repeatedly said the app is not for sale.\n\n\u201cWhen push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the government, told the Supreme Court Friday. \u201cIt might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.\u201d\n\nWhat about Trump?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promises to save TikTok have also added uncertainty to how a ban would unfold.\n\nAhead of Friday\u2019s Supreme Court hearing, Trump filed a brief urging the court to temporarily pause the ban\u2019s implementation \u2014 currently set to begin one day before his inauguration \u2014 to give him time, as president, to negotiate a sale of TikTok.\n\nLegal experts have also suggested that Trump could simply choose not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they won\u2019t be fined for continuing to host the app on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that come January 20th, 21st, 22nd, we might be in a different world,\u201d Francisco, TikTok\u2019s attorney, said Friday, referencing the change in administration.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, that those companies would be willing to violate the letter of the law, even with an assurance from Trump.\n\n\u201cI am a little concerned that a suggestion that the president-elect or anyone else would not enforce the law, when a law is in effect and is prohibitive of certain action, that a company would choose to ignore enforcement on any assurance, other than a change in that law,\u201d liberal-leaning Justice Sonia Sotomayor said during the hearing. \u201cWhatever the new president does, doesn\u2019t change that reality for these companies.\u201d",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nJoanne Molinaro\u2019s life changed when she found TikTok.\n\nShe had clawed all the way up to being a partner at a big Chicago law firm after more than a decade of working in corporate litigation. And it nearly crushed her.\n\n\u201cI was thinking to myself \u2026 lucky me to have this job that pays my bills,\u201d Molinaro said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Terms of Service podcast. \u201cAnd so what if it\u2019s soul-sucking and it makes me want to curl up at night into fetal position and cry? That\u2019s okay because this is what adults do.\u201d\n\nLike many people who were bored at home in the pandemic spring of 2020, Molinaro downloaded TikTok for fun. She mainly watched other people\u2019s videos, although she also posted some cooking videos of her own. But then, one of her videos unexpectedly went viral.\n\nJust over a year later, Molinaro withdrew from partnership at her firm to go full-time as a TikTok creator. She\u2019s since built a brand around her profile, @TheKoreanVegan, publishing a cookbook with the same name and racking up more than 3 million followers across TikTok and Instagram.\n\nMolinaro is just one of many TikTok influencers who are now bracing for a possible ban of the app in the United States \u2014 and the loss of her six-figure income that could come with it.\n\nA US law that could ban TikTok is set to go into effect on January 19, unless the app is sold or the law is blocked by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court is heard oral arguments on TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the law, which the company claims violates its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users. The US government has argued that the app poses a risk to national security because its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China.\n\n\u201cTikTok collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans, which the (People\u2019s Republic of China) could use for espionage or blackmail,\u201d the US Justice Department stated in a legal filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cAnd the PRC could covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States.\u201d\n\nThe court appeared likely to uphold the law and allow the ban to go into effect, with both liberal and conservative justices directing a series of tough and skeptical questions at lawyers for TikTok and the app\u2019s users. Several key justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, worried about the potential national security concerns that two presidents have raised about the platform. Historically, the court has deferred to the other branches of government on matters of national security.\n\n\u201cAre we supposed to ignore the fact that (TikTok\u2019s) ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\u201d Roberts said.\n\nAnd during more than two hours of arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law not primarily as one with First Amendment implications, but rather an effort to regulate foreign control of popular app.\n\nBut TikTok lawyer, Noel Francisco, repeatedly argued that the law violates its free speech rights, and that separating TikTok\u2019s US presence from ByteDance is an unreasonable solution.\n\n\u201cAny new TikTok would be a fundamentally different platform with different content, which is yet another reason why I think this is a content-based restriction that falls directly on TikTok,\u201d Francisco said.\n\nFinancial impact of a ban\n\nMany TikTok users aren\u2019t concerned by the Chinese government, at least if the revenue they generate is any indication.\n\nBy TikTok\u2019s own estimate, the 7 million US small businesses that use the app stand to lose $1 billion in revenue, and around 2 million creators would suffer $300 million in lost earnings in just one month, if the app is banned.\n\n\u201cA TikTok ban would be absolutely catastrophic for the creators and the small businesses who rely on it,\u201d said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media and internet culture. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career talking to creators and influencers, they are resilient, they\u2019ll pivot, but it will be a struggle in the meantime and take a hit to them financially.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s popularity skyrocketed in 2020 thanks in large part to its unique algorithm, which prioritizes showing users entertaining content whether or not it\u2019s from an account they follow. It was unlike older mainstay platforms\u2019 feeds, which had largely been based on reinforcing existing social connections. Users flocked to the app, as did creators, who found it far easier to quickly build an audience and discover almost overnight success if they correctly predicted what the algorithm would want.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Eli Rallo, who downloaded the app in 2020 as a senior in college, stuck at home because of Covid-19.\n\n(L-R): Joanne Molinaro, Eli Rallo. The two creators are working to grow other income streams ahead of a possible TikTok ban. JP Yim/John Nacion/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI was messing around with my brothers one night\u2026 in our kitchen. And I made a video of us filling up a jar of snacks with trail mix and I put music behind it. It was kind of random, very Gen Z humor-esque,\u201d Rallo told CNN. \u201cAnd the next day it had, like, 200,000 views. I was shocked. And then I just started to make videos from there.\u201d\n\nSocial media has been Rallo\u2019s full-time job since October 2021; she now has more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram and is in the process of writing her second book.\n\n\u201cMy career just simply would not be where it is today without TikTok,\u201d she said.\n\nRallo says she now regularly inks five-figure deals with brands to promote their products on TikTok. She\u2019s part of the \u201ccreator economy\u201d that Goldman Sachs has estimated could be worth $480 billion by 2027.\n\nBut she\u2019s worried that could change if the app is banned.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned, if I\u2019m being honest, about what would happen because I do think my financial situation would change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky that I make money from my books, and I\u2019m very lucky that I make money from brands on Instagram. I think we would see an uptick in deals on Instagram, but the TikTok money is definitely the bulk of my income.\u201d\n\nMolinaro said she\u2019s already seeing the financial impact of a potential ban, starting back in April when President Joe Biden signed the sale-or-ban law. In 2024, Molinaro estimates she took in 30% less money from sponsors.\n\n\u201cThose brands are not willing to spend dollars right now because they\u2019re terrified. \u2018Oh, why would I spend money on a campaign that\u2019s going to just fall flat on its face in a few days?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat has directly impacted me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s impacted a lot of influencers.\u201d\n\nOpportunity on other platforms\n\nA TikTok ban could boost competitors like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut for people who make earn their income on TikTok, it may be difficult to shift to depending entirely on those other platforms.\n\nIt can take time to build up a following on other apps large enough to draw big sponsorships, as their TikTok followers may or may not follow them. And other platforms\u2019 algorithms often prioritize different things \u2014 maybe longer videos or certain kinds of music \u2014 and it can take time for people to adjust their strategies.\n\nTikTok supporters hold signs at a news conference expressing concerns about the sale-or-ban legislation, outside of the US Capitol Building on March 12, 2024 in Washington, DC Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same technology. It\u2019s not the same type of user. It\u2019s not the same culture,\u201d Maddox said.\n\nAnd a ban could have ripple effects beyond individuals on TikTok. Many influencers employ teams to support their careers, such as agents, accountants and lawyers to review brand deals.\n\n\u201cMany people think, oh, a TikTok ban is going to mean these glamorous, frivolous influencers are going to have to get real jobs,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s the top 1% that is making a lot of money and living a very glamorous lifestyle. But the reality is the people who are going to be most hurt by a TikTok ban are those staunchly middle-class Americans who are using this for information, for entertainment, to grow their business, their following, and grow their community.\u201d\n\nFor now, Rallo and Molinaro say they\u2019re working to diversify their businesses and grow their followings elsewhere, including other social platforms or email newsletters.\n\n\u201cSocial media, somebody once described it to me, it\u2019s like building real estate on sand. You never know,\u201d Molinaro said.\n\n\u2013CNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report.",

Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\n\nWith its silky orange mane and wide-eyed glare, the golden lion tamarin might not seem out of place as a character in a Dr Seuss book.\n\nLion tamarins, small monkeys found in eastern Brazil, were described as \"beautiful, simian-like cats similar to small lions,\" by Antonio Pigafetta, one of the explorers on the first voyage to successfully circumnavigate the Earth in 1519.\n\nHalf a millennium later, the golden lion tamarin has become something of a local celebrity \u2013 featuring on a Brazilian postage stamp and the country\u2019s 20 real banknote.\n\nYet despite its popularity, the species is under threat. Its native habitat, the Atlantic rainforest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, has been reduced to just over 7% of its original size. Of that, 80% is highly fragmented, and most patches are too small to support healthy golden lion tamarin populations. Alongside capture for the pet trade, this drove the species to the brink of extinction; by the 1970s as few as 200 individuals remained in the wild.\n\nHowever, through coordinated reintroduction programs, vaccination schemes and initiatives to reconnect fragmented habitats, the golden lion tamarin has made an impressive comeback. The IUCN changed its status from critically endangered to endangered in 2003, and the most recent census estimated 4,800 wild individuals.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blared toward space Wednesday carrying a pair of lunar landers on a journey to our closest celestial neighbor \u2014 kicking off what\u2019s expected to be a bustling year of moon missions amid a renewed race to establish a long-term human presence on the lunar surface.\n\nThe SpaceX rocket took off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 1:11 a.m. ET.\n\nTucked inside the rocket\u2019s bullet-shaped nose cone were the two lunar landers \u2014 hailing from two different countries. The first is Blue Ghost, a 6.6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) lunar lander developed by Firefly Aerospace, a Cedar Park, Texas-based company.\n\nThe uncrewed mission marks Firefly\u2019s first foray into sending a spacecraft to the lunar surface. The company is a contractor for NASA\u2019s Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, which is part of the space agency\u2019s Artemis program \u2014 a framework under which NASA plans to return humans to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time for the lunar economy,\u201d Firefly Aerospace CEO Jason Kim told CNN in December, adding that he\u2019s \u201c100% confident in our team\u2019s ability\u201d \u2014 even if success isn\u2019t guaranteed for Blue Ghost\u2019s inaugural flight.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost and Ispace's Resilience lunar landers, lifts off Wednesday from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Image\n\nSharing a ride inside the Falcon 9 rocket\u2019s cargo bay is a 7.5-foot-tall (2.3-meter-tall) lunar lander from Tokyo-based Ispace. Wednesday\u2019s launch kicked off the company\u2019s second attempt to send one of its Hakuto-R spacecraft to the moon.\n\nIspace is a company that aims to sell its services to space agencies or private companies seeking to put science or other payloads on the moon. Similar to Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology, which developed the Peregrine lunar lander that met a fiery end during its first attempted mission in January 2024, the company has its roots in the Google Lunar XPrize. The competition offered $20 million to any company that could get a lander to the lunar surface in an effort to spur space technology innovation in the private sector. (The contest ultimately ended in 2018 with no winner as development processes took longer than expected.)\n\nFirefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander aims to carry 10 NASA tech demos and scientific instruments to the moon. Firefly Aerospace/NASA\n\nIspace, which is now a publicly traded company on the Tokyo stock exchange, made its first moon landing attempt in 2023, but the Hakuto-R spacecraft used on that mission ultimately crash-landed, creating a fresh pockmark on the lunar surface. The company later attributed the failed landing attempt to imprecise data about the spacecraft\u2019s altitude.\n\nBut Ispace said it\u2019s back \u2014 armed with lessons learned \u2014 and ready to execute a soft touchdown the second time around.\n\n\u201cWe gathered huge data, very valuable data, from mission one,\u201d Jumpei Nozaki, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Monday. \u201cSo we 100% are going to utilize this (on) mission two. And, yes, we have confidence to make a successful mission this time.\u201d\n\nBoth Firefly and Ispace confirmed they have established communication with the Blue Ghost and Resilience landers, respectively, after launch. Both spacecraft are healthy and operating as expected as they embark on their lunar journeys.\n\nThe looming lunar trek\n\nA model of Ispace's Hakuto-R lunar lander is seen at a venue in Tokyo on April 26, 2023. Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters\n\nThe Ispace Hakuto-R and Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost lunar landers may be hitching the same ride to space, but they will take different paths to the moon.\n\nThe Hakuto-R and Blue Ghost landers are now beginning their individual journeys.\n\nUltimately, Blue Ghost will spend about 25 days orbiting Earth before making a four-day trek to the moon and spending a couple weeks in lunar orbit. Firefly confirmed a target landing date of March 2.\n\nThe Hakuto-R lander, called Resilience, is taking an even slower path to the moon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a low-energy trajectory,\u201d Nozaki said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not necessarily something bad. We can verify many kind of systems during this long journey.\u201d\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera took a snapshot of the lunar pockmark made when Ispace's Hakuto-R spacecraft crash-landed after its first mission. The image was captured on April 26, 2023, the day after the attempted landing. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe company has not publicly set an expected landing date for Resilience, but Nozaki told CNN that the spacecraft will follow a path similar to that of the last Hakuto-R mission \u2014 taking four to five months to reach the moon.\n\nHakuto-R\u2019s inaugural mission failed because the spacecraft miscalculated its descent as it passed over a crater, causing it to plummet about 3 miles (5 kilometers ) to the ground, according to Ispace.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything performed perfectly \u2014 propulsion system, communication system, and also structure,\u201d Nozaki said of the first Hakuto-R mission. \u201cThe issue was the software and the altitude measurement has some issue.\u201d\n\nA NASA spacecraft captured an image of the impact crater created during the crash landing.\n\nWhat\u2019s on board the Blue Ghost moon lander\n\nBlue Ghost will seek to touch down on the lunar surface near Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or \u201cSea of Crises,\u201d on the far eastern edge of the moon\u2019s near side.\n\nOn board Blue Ghost is a group of science instruments and technology demonstrations to test satellite navigation, radiation-adapted computers, self-cleaning glass that can clear away lunar dust, and a \u201cLunar PlanetVac\u201d to collect and sort soil samples on the moon, according to Firefly Aerospace.\n\nKim, the company\u2019s CEO, said he is also excited about the possibility of sharing images and footage the Blue Ghost lander may capture.\n\nThe Lunar PlanetVac, designed to use compressed gas to acquire lunar soil, is one payload flying on board the Blue Ghost lunar lander. Firefly Aerospace/NASA\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a phenomenon called the lunar horizon glow that only the Apollo 15 and 17 astronauts have seen with their eyes,\u201d Kim told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to capture that in 4K-by-4K high-definition video and share that with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nLunar horizon glow occurs when photons from the sun react with the moon\u2019s soil, or regolith, causing electrostatic particles to float. The lofted dust scatters the light.\n\nBlue Ghost will operate for about 14 days on the moon\u2019s surface until its landing zone is thrust into lunar nighttime. During the dark period, temperatures can drop to minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 173 degrees Celsius), forcing the spacecraft to cease operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s on board Resilience\n\nUnderpinned by its motto \u201cNever Quit the Lunar Quest,\u201d Ispace is seeking redemption with its Resilience lander.\n\nThe company\u2019s first lunar landing attempt aimed to put a Hakuto-R lander in the Atlas crater on the northeastern corner of the moon\u2019s near side.\n\nThis go-around, Ispace aims for a different lunar location: a 750-mile-long (1,200-kilometer) plain called Mare Frigoris \u2014 or the \u201cSea of Cold\u201d \u2014 which lies in the moon\u2019s far northern reaches.\n\nMare Frigoris is significantly flatter than the Atlas crater region, potentially offering easier-to-navigate terrain. In a statement, Ispace said the new landing site was chosen because it offers \u201cflexibility.\u201d\n\nThe region also features conditions ripe for a miniature rover, called Tenacious, to explore, the company said. The vehicle, which stands 10 inches (26 centimeters) tall and weighs about 11 pounds (5 kilograms), is designed to disembark from the Resilience lander and explore the surrounding terrain.\n\nThe lunar region called Mare Frigoris is outlined in teal in this mosaic composed of many images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. NASA\n\nThe rover, developed by Ispace\u2019s European branch with co-funding from the Luxembourg Space Agency, is equipped with a small shovel to collect a sample of lunar soil. Ispace intends to transfer ownership to NASA \u2014 but the sample itself will remain on the moon, according to Nozaki. (NASA did not comment on the matter during a Tuesday news conference.)\n\nThe lander itself is also carrying experiments and tech demos, including a water electrolyzer and a module that will test algae-based food production. The payloads were provided by corporations as well as academic institutions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, commemorative objects, such as a metal plate that pays homage to Japanese sci-fi franchise Gundam, and artwork are on board the spacecraft.\n\nSwedish artist Mikael Genberg has contributed a miniature red house dubbed the \u201cMoonhouse.\u201d Genberg has been aiming to put a red house on the lunar surface for more than two decades.\n\n\u201cThe Moonhouse, the first house on the moon, could be an expression of humanity\u2019s ability to achieve the seemingly unattainable through boundary-crossing thoughts and collaborations and maybe a symbol of humanity\u2019s eternal and collective striving; a perspective on existence and (an) eye towards Earth,\u201d according to a web page about the art project.\n\nThe project hopes to follow a slew of other novelties, art pieces and curiosities that have been part of past lunar missions.\n\nA Jeff Koons sculpture series called \u201cMoon Phases,\u201d for example, flew on the Odysseus lunar lander from Houston-based Intuitive Machines last year, becoming the first \u201cauthorized\u201d work of art on the moon.",

            "title": "How a single state took Harris down and raised the new era of Trump",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This is the first of a five-part series that looks at how Donald Trump mounted the greatest comeback in American political history, how he is preparing for what he and his own team describe as a potentially tumultuous second term, and what all that might mean for those who support him \u2014 and those who don\u2019t.\n\nWhen the sun falls from the darkening Washington, DC, sky, the electric crowd at Howard University appears certain it will rise brighter. Singing, cheering, linking arms and raising hands in the great outdoor quadrangle known as The Yard, they have come by the thousands to watch the election returns and witness history in a place where it has been made before.\n\nThe historically Black university has produced legendary authors and actors, esteemed scientists, the titanic Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and the groundbreaking woman for whom the rapturous throngs have rallied tonight.\n\n\u201cAnd every time we hear a mention of Kamala Harris winning another state this crowd goes crazy!\u201d a local television reporter says to her camera.\n\nAcademically, every soul here knows the vice president could lose. But in the way of true believers in every political campaign, they feel she is destined to win; that the polls will clang shut east to west and acclaim will echo back from the far ocean, across the Rockies and Plains, through the farms and industrial towns to the nation\u2019s capital, where their candidate will become the first woman elected president of the United States.\n\nHer whole campaign, after all, has been like a movie, and that\u2019s how movies end. The fact that Harris \u2014 a Black and Asian American woman \u2014 will crush the man many Democrats see as dismissive of women and non-Whites, former President Donald Trump, is a delicious detail they will savor all their lives.\n\nSupporters watch results come in during an election night watch party for Harris at Howard University on November 5, 2024 in Washington, DC. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n\u201c\u2026 We\u2019re going to be here all night bringing you coverage,\u201d the reporter goes on, \u201cso stay tuned!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were feeling so confident,\u201d says CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, who was also in the crowd. \u201cThey really thought they had it in the bag.\u201d\n\nThe candidate is a few miles away at the US Naval Observatory, the official residence of all vice presidents: close enough to dash to the rally for a victory speech, far enough to be free of the crowd\u2019s intoxicating optimism. There and at her campaign offices everywhere, sober political scrutiny is being brought to bear on every report from every precinct.\n\n\u201cAll of us knew there were headwinds,\u201d says Dan Kanninen, battleground state director for Harris. A political pro with a long pedigree, he is sharply aware of the worldwide trends against incumbents, the deep dissatisfaction of Americans with the direction of their country, and the late start Harris had been saddled with by President Joe Biden\u2019s unexpected departure from the race in July.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris had a lot to do in 107 days that was hard to do in 107 days. She had to define herself, pick a VP, stake out her positions,\u201d Kanninen says. He thought Harris could overcome it all, but the early exit polls confirm what other assessments have shown in the closing weeks. Her rapid-fire campaign is on a knife\u2019s edge. Victory and defeat seem equally plausible. And something else in the numbers is troubling. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s approval ratings were the highest they\u2019d ever been,\u201d Kanninen says. \u201cHe was at 41, 42,43, 44% his entire candidacy and his entire presidency. He was at 49 in this campaign.\u201d\n\nAlmost a thousand miles south at the former president\u2019s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, Trump is hosting a private watch party with the movers, shakers and wannabes of his circle, and he is seemingly nursing his own concerns. Earlier in the day, while casting his vote, he\u2019d appeared tired, and he uncharacteristically nodded to the possibility of defeat.\n\n\u201cI hear we are doing very well everywhere,\u201d he said to the cameras, adding, \u201cI may regret that statement, but I\u2019m hearing that we\u2019re doing very well.\u201d He said he had not written a victory speech. \u201cIf I win, I know what I\u2019m going to say, and I don\u2019t even want to think about the losing part.\u201d\n\nA reporter called out, \u201cRegardless of what happens tonight, is this your last campaign? Are you done after this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I would think so,\u201d Trump said, looking at the floor. \u201cI would think so.\u201d\n\nNow it is evening, and by many accounts the most effective campaign team Trump has ever had is clawing through the data as feverishly as Harris\u2019 contingent and sharing similar doubts. CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes is tracking the Trump team\u2019s anxiety from the public watch party, which is also just a few minutes from the candidate\u2019s citadel to allow a quick victory speech if warranted.\n\n\u201cThey believed he was going to win. However, it was very tight margins,\u201d she says later, noting that Team Trump was gambling that the polls, which ever so slightly favored him in the closing days, were underestimating his strength just as in past campaigns. \u201cThey believed that (Trump\u2019s supporters) were being under-polled. That the actual turnout would have Donald Trump winning. That meant if they were reading it wrong\u2026 he might not win.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Harris\u2019 ascendancy on the Democratic ticket \u2014 with her ecstatic crowds, celebrity backers, and mountains of fresh donations \u2014 had shaken the Republican candidate and his team from the start. \u201cHe himself saw a lot of the momentum around Kamala Harris,\u201d Holmes says. \u201cI think they believed that was slowing down, but there was still concern that there was some weird way she could pull it out.\u201d\n\nEyes on the battlegrounds\n\nThe evening is a grind of returns and projections that are neither surprising nor consequential in that both campaigns have pre-counted the electoral hauls from states where their wins are unassailable. Trump takes Indiana and Kentucky. Harris wins Vermont. Trump takes Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Harris grabs Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Trump wins Ohio. Harris takes Illinois. Journalists stand in front of glowing maps analyzing the spreading patchwork of reds and blues. More than 35 million Americans are watching on TV; untold millions more are tracking the action online. Everyone has been told it will take a long night, perhaps long days, before a winner can be determined.\n\nAt Howard, the huge crowd remains packed and buoyant. In Florida, conservative firebrand Tucker Carlson chats on a webcast with Trump super-supporter Elon Musk. When the richest man in the world\u2019s small son giggles, Carlson joins in. \u201cI like your laugh,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the laugh of an honest man!\u201d\n\nBehind the celebrations, the Harris and Trump number-crunchers are eyeing the battleground states that could go either way. Each election has them, and they change from time to time, but in this race, they are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Shortly after 10 p.m., the Tar Heel state arrives first at the tape.\n\n\u201cCNN projects that Donald Trump will win the state of North Carolina,\u201d says Jake Tapper as 16 electoral votes are added to Trump\u2019s column and the watch party in West Palm Beach erupts. \u201cDonald Trump now has 227 electoral votes. Kamala Harris has 153.\u201d\n\nIt is not seismic. Harris\u2019 team knew North Carolina \u2014 which Trump twice won before \u2014 was a reach. She wins Oregon, New Mexico, Virginia and Hawaii.\n\nThen, at nearly midnight on the East Coast, another battleground is called. Georgia goes for Trump too. Still, not a huge surprise. The fact that it had flipped by a sliver from predictably red to blue for Biden in 2020 was unusual enough to make the Peach State a central part of Trump\u2019s obsessive claim that Democrats must have cheated. Georgia was where then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani would falsely accuse a pair of poll workers of manipulating the results in Biden\u2019s favor. The former New York mayor\u2019s election lies would cost him his law license and a court would order him to pay the two women almost $150 million for defamation. Among items he was ordered to forfeit: his luxury apartment in Manhattan, a baseball jersey signed by Joe DiMaggio, a 1980s Mercedes that once belonged to the late film star Lauren Bacall, furniture, clothing, jewelry and more.\n\nPeople follow election results on a computer as they attend an election night watch party at Scranton Cultural Center on November 5, 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nWith two battlegrounds now sizzling red on the map, the campaign teams go back to watching the remaining five, and one above all the others. Like armies circling each other at a distance, trying to find the most favorable spot for their inevitable clash, both campaigns in the final weeks have settled on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as critical to their victory.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the state so important?\u201d asks CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish. \u201cDemocrats dominate the two largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but spread out in between are rural territories favoring Republican candidates. And over time the state\u2019s suburbs have become uniquely purple.\u201d\n\nThat perfectly balanced prize leaned Biden\u2019s way in 2020 and secured his win. Pennsylvania is where Harris has spent enormous amounts of money and time trying to rally every voter she can find. Pennsylvania is where Trump was grazed by a bullet, cementing his image as a fighter for his fans and, polls suggest, giving a boost to his long-beleaguered approval ratings.\n\nEach campaign has mapped out many intricate combinations of demographics, geography, election law and ground forces to plot a winning path. Both parties have battalions of lawyers prepared for the court cases that will surely explode if the results are as tenuous as so many experts predict. The possibilities have been analyzed by pundits to the point of exhaustion. Yet for practical purposes, in every scenario Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes will live up to its name as the Keystone State.\n\nPolls have found the contest there agonizingly close, and the law itself is conspiring to prolong the suspense. \u201cState law in Pennsylvania doesn\u2019t permit our county election officials to begin processing \u2026 mail-in ballots until 7 a.m. on election morning,\u201d Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of the commonwealth, explains. \u201cPlenty of other states, red and blue alike, allow that process to begin days if not weeks in advance.\u201d\n\nFor all the efforts to suss out the true nature of this year\u2019s electorate and divine what will actually happen, Pennsylvania began Election Day as a black box. Unknown. Unknowable. It is among the places most likely to drag the final decision of this race into an eternity of waiting.\n\nBut that is not what happens. As results begin trickling, then flooding, in from Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Uniontown, Scranton, Bradford, Erie and beyond, a rumble begins in both the Harris and Trump camps. In short hours, it becomes an earthquake shaking the Democratic Party\u2019s famed blue wall to its foundation.\n\nAt 2:05 in the morning, Pennsylvania falls to Trump. Tapper is back on screen looking at the results from his home state and saying, \u201cThis is a huge, huge achievement for Donald Trump and a huge bucket of electoral votes.\u201d\n\nOf more than 7 million votes cast in Pennsylvania, Trump beats Harris by just over 120,000. But it\u2019s enough to brush away any doubts. At Howard University, the crowd is stunned. CNN\u2019s Alvarez is working the phone, firing off emails, trying to get any read from the Harris team. Nothing.\n\nHarris supporters watch election results come in at Howard University in Washington, DC. Austin Steele/CNN\n\n\u201cThe campaign had pretty much gone dark,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were not responding to just about anything. I talked to one source who said once Pennsylvania was clearly going to Donald Trump, it was the nail in the coffin.\u201d\n\nWisconsin is so close it seems Harris might win, but Trump takes it, too. Then he wins Michigan.\n\nNews outlets, adding up the electoral votes, begin calling the race.\n\nIt is over.\n\nA decisive, if limited, victory\n\n\u201cLook what happened! Is this crazy?\u201d\n\nTrump is crowing, beaming, exulting before a thunderous MAGA crowd in the wee hours, celebrating what many consider the election of a lifetime even as much of America is asleep, many unaware of the finality they will wake to in the morning.\n\nHis team had braced, like everyone else, for a marathon slog to a declared victory, but now they stand startlingly at the finish line. \u201cThey were pretty confident by around 10 p.m. \u2014 10 or 11 \u2014 that they had won the election,\u201d Holmes says, but the team gently guarded against Trump making any premature declaration of victory as he had in his 2020 loss. Holmes says they told him, \u201cWe think you can win this. Let\u2019s just wait it out and see.\u201d\n\nNow he is free to proclaim his joy and relief to the world and he is bathing in the adulation.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was a movement like nobody\u2019s ever seen before \u2026 and frankly this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time \u2026 and now it\u2019s going to reach a new level of importance because we\u2019re going to help our country heal.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, not just the Electoral College, but more Americans have chosen him over anyone else to be president of the United States. \u201cThat means everything to him,\u201d Holmes says based on her years of being around Trump. \u201cTo him, it means that he is the real winner. For him, it is a much bigger deal to win the popular vote because it says a lot of his \u2018gut\u2019 was right.\u201d\n\nRight about the issues that would light up American voters. Right about the framing of his opponents.\n\nDonald Trump appears with his wife Melania and son Barron at his election night watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nAt 78, he is the oldest person ever to win the White House, yet he dances onstage as the crowd cheers. \u201cWinning the popular vote was very nice,\u201d he says. \u201cVery nice, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s victory is decisive. He not only forced his party to keep him as its standard bearer after he left Washington in disgrace in 2021, but he also convinced a solid majority of the GOP he had never lost in 2020 anyway. He became the first Republican to win both the electoral and popular vote since President George W. Bush 20 years ago. Trump expanded his margins over 2020 and bested Harris in every battleground state. He led the ticket as his party recaptured the US Senate and held onto the House. He coaxed thousands of typically Democratic-leaning Black, brown and Asian Americans into his fold. He wagered against the advice of political pros on his ability to ignite passions among low-propensity voters and lure them to the polls \u2014 and his bet paid off.\n\nThe new president-elect proclaims the might of his victory. \u201cAmerica has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate!\u201d\n\nBut calling his win a landslide, as so many Trump allies do, is laughably false.\n\nTrump received slightly more than 77.3 million popular votes \u2014 just 1.5 percentage points more than Harris. It is one of the more anemic victories in a half-century and weak even in these hyper-partisan times, when close races are common. He collected 312 electoral votes, putting him in the lower half of all presidential winners \u2014 certainly more than Biden\u2019s 306 in 2020, but far behind Barack Obama in 2008 with 365 and 2012 with 332. Bill Clinton was elected and reelected with electoral counts in the 370s. And the GOP\u2019s hold on both chambers of Congress will be very narrow, making it potentially politically hazardous for the party to aggressively pursue the more radical aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nAnd it is worth noting a fine point from which Trump\u2019s foes may take cold comfort: Most Americans who cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election did not want Trump to win. He clearly and fairly took the plurality of those votes, but the majority was split between Harris and a smattering of third-party candidates. Trump ended up with just under 50% of all the votes cast.\n\nHe undeniably won. But despite his historic, remarkable comeback, once again Trump will be a minority president.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon said Monday she would not block the release of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s report on his investigation into Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nHowever, Cannon scheduled a court hearing later this week on Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s plan to share with some lawmakers the part of Smith\u2019s report dealing with the classified documents probe. In the meantime, she is continuing to halt the department from disclosing that aspect of the report to anyone outside of the agency.\n\nTrump asked the judge late Monday to rethink her order clearing the way for the release of the portion dealing with the 2020 election probe, arguing it should remain on hold so that he could put forward his arguments for blocking the report\u2019s entire release at the Friday hearing.\n\nCannon rejected the Trump team\u2019s last-minute attempt to delay the Justice Department\u2019s release of the election subversion volume of the report, leaving an earlier hold on it to lift at midnight.\n\nThe rebuff from the Trump-appointed judge marked the latest twist in a court fight that has upended the Justice Department\u2019s preparations for winding down its investigations into Trump before he is sworn into office next week, while jeopardizing the transparency Congress and the public have into those probes.\n\nThe department has historically released the final reports on special counsel investigations into presidents, including while those presidents were still in the White House. But as part of an unrelenting legal attack on Smith, Trump and his allies have delayed the publication of the January 6 volume of the report, which is not expected to break new ground factually, and has paused even limited disclosure of the report on the classified documents investigation.\n\nTrump has chosen multiple members of his personal defense teams for roles in his incoming administration.\n\nCannon, according to Monday\u2019s order, is continuing to halt the department\u2019s release of the report\u2019s classified documents volume because she \u201cis not willing to make that gamble on the basis of generalized interest by members of Congress, at least not without full briefing and a hearing on the subject.\u201d\n\nGarland had planned to allow the Republicans and Democrats who lead the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to review the report privately on the condition that they do not disclose information from it.\n\nGarland has said he will publicly release the special counsel report into Trump and the 2020 election aftermath before Trump takes office next Monday. The Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe previous order Cannon placed blocking release of both volumes was set to expire at midnight going into Tuesday, allowing the department to release the 2020 election case volume then.\n\nThe 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals had already rejected the Trump team\u2019s earlier request to block the report\u2019s publication.\n\nAfter Cannon\u2019s initial order, Trump said on social media that Smith was \u201cwas illegitimately involved in this political persecution, and all of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by our hapless government were, simply put, wasted!\u201d\n\nIn the election subversion case, Smith alleged that Trump and several unindicted co-conspirators undertook a multi-stage scheme to attack the peaceful transfer of power, culminating in the January 2021 assault on the US Capitol by Trump\u2019s supporters. The case was stymied by a Supreme Court ruling last summer and ultimately dropped after Election Day.\n\nIn the Mar-a-Lago documents case, Trump was charged with mishandling national defense information he took with him from his first turn in the White House. He was also accused of obstructing the federal probe into the documents\u2019 whereabouts, as were to of his two employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira.\n\nThe defense lawyers argued that Cannon\u2019s decision last summer finding Smith was unconstitutionally appointed prevented Garland from releasing the report for both special counsel investigations. Because the appointments ruling is currently on appeal, raising the possibility the prosecution could be revived, the Trump employees also argue that releasing report could prejudice them as defendants. Trump was dismissed from the case after his reelection.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "title": "Tyson Fury announced he\u2019s retiring from boxing. Not everyone believes him",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe boxing world was handed a shock on Monday when former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury announced his retirement from the sport \u2026 again.\n\nIn a 17-second video posted on Instagram, Fury said: \u201cHi everybody, I\u2019ll make this short and sweet, I\u2019d like to announce my retirement from boxing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a blast and I\u2019ve loved every single minute of it. I\u2019m going to end with this: Dick Turpin wore a mask. God bless everybody, I\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d\n\nDick Turpin was an English robber and highwayman whose criminal activities gained him notoriety in the early eighteenth century. It\u2019s unclear what Fury was implying with the reference.\n\nThe 36-year-old\u2019s announcement came just weeks after he lost his highly-anticipated rematch against Ukraine\u2019s Oleksandr Usyk for the WBA, WBC and WBO world titles.\n\nThe Ukrainian won that fight 116-112 on all three of the judges\u2019 scorecards \u2013 much to the displeasure of the Fury camp.\n\nUsyk handed Fury the only professional defeats of the British fighter\u2019s rollercoaster career, one which has involved incredible comebacks and a total 34 wins and one draw.\n\nNews of such an influential boxer retiring might usually be met with a larger reaction from the community, only this isn\u2019t the first time that Fury has retired from the sport.\n\nIn April 2022, he said he would retire after beating Dillian Whyte, only to return to the ring six months later. He also announced retirements in 2013 and 2017.\n\nRetiring for good?\n\nThe big question on everyone\u2019s mind is whether Fury will stay retired this time. If you look at the comments under his retirement video, not many people seem to think so.\n\nDespite losing his last two fights to Usyk, he remains one of the biggest characters in boxing and a huge draw for both fans and promotors.\n\nFury (right) lost to Usyk (left) in their rematch in December, 2024. Richard Pelham/Getty Images\n\nFury\u2019s latest defeat to Usyk set up the possibility of a titanic all-British clash with Anthony Joshua, a fight which has been talked about for years.\n\nThe announcement on Monday now throws that potential fight into question, but Eddie Hearn \u2013 Joshua\u2019s promoter \u2013 isn\u2019t certain we\u2019ve seen the last of Fury.\n\nHe hopes that the draw of facing Joshua in what would be one of the biggest fights in British boxing history might persuade Fury to fight again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to want it. You\u2019ve got to want to provide the British public with the biggest fight in the history of the sport. You\u2019ve got to want to go to war with AJ (Anthony Joshua) and get that victory. If it\u2019s just a money thing, you\u2019ve got enough money,\u201d Heard told BBC Sport in wake of Fury\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always an optimist. For me, when that fight with AJ is a fight that can be made in two minutes in a room, I am always hopeful. But Tyson Fury\u2019s earned the right to make his own decisions. If he\u2019s done, he\u2019s done. If not, then we make the biggest fight in the history of the sport. Only time will tell.\n\nFury's potential fight with Joshua looks in jeopardy. James Chance/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIf Fury doesn\u2019t want the fight, there\u2019s nothing you can do. You can\u2019t drag him into the fight. I don\u2019t know whether this was a move to stop the flow of pressure because with AJ calling him out, pressure is mounting.\u201d\n\nFury\u2019s manager, Spencer Brown, said the announcement came as a \u201chuge shock\u201d to him.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s just thought, \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019\u201d Brown told former boxing champion George Groves. \u201cHe makes those decisions and I\u2019m sure that will be it. Never say never but this time I can\u2019t see it changing.\u201d\n\nCNN has contacted Fury\u2019s management company for further comment on the retirement decision.\n\nHow the heavyweight division stands\n\nWith Fury gone \u2013 for the moment \u2013 and Joshua recovering from his fourth career defeat, the heavyweight division is in a state of flux at the start of 2025.\n\nUsyk holds three of the divisions belts while Britan\u2019s Daniel Dubois holds the IBF title.\n\nDubois will put his belt on the line for the second time on February 22 against New Zealand\u2019s Joseph Parker and has previously called for a unification fight against Usyk in the future.\n\nAs for Usyk, who defeated Dubois via knockout in 2023, the 37-year-old has said he\u2019s having a break from boxing while he sees how the rest of the division falls around him.\n\nHe has also teased a possible return to the cruiserweight division having previously won world titles at the lower weight class.",

            "title": "How a stowaway slipped through security and made it on a plane to Hawaii, according to documents",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Christmas Eve stowaway who boarded a Delta Air Lines flight to Hawaii slipped past both a TSA ID check and a gate agent with no ticket, according to public records obtained by CNN.\n\nThe stowaway was identified as Shemaiah Patrice Small, 33, of California, according to the documents. Small snuck past a TSA ID check the night before Christmas Eve and wandered the airport allegedly barefoot before she tried to hitch a ride on Delta Air Lines Flight 487 from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Honolulu the next day. During boarding, she managed to slip past a gate agent by hiding behind another passenger but was discovered aboard the aircraft sitting in someone else\u2019s seat.\n\nDelta employees noticed Small and asked her to deboard.\n\nSmall fled the gate before law enforcement could arrive, according to airport officials, and when police later located her in the airport, she was arrested and charged with criminal trespassing in the first degree and making false statements to public servants.\n\nShe was identified through a fingerprint database, after giving false names and information to law enforcement.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration and the Port of Seattle confirmed the incident to CNN.\n\nStowaway situations don\u2019t happen often, but each represents a lapse in aviation security. And the incidents can be deadly for the potential stowaway when they attempt to hide outside of the passenger cabin. Other times, like in Small\u2019s case, they face serious charges. These types of incidents raise alarms about problems within the aviation security system, experts say.\n\nGetting past security, staying overnight\n\nSmall slipped through the line divider at Checkpoint 3 at the Seattle airport on December 23 at about 9:06 p.m., the public records show.\n\nAn officer reviewing security footage observed she slipped through a line divider to cut to the front of the checkpoint waiting line. She stood at the front of the line for several minutes.\n\n\u201cI watched (Small) duck underneath a line dividing stanchion and bypass the portion of TSA screening that checks ID and boarding pass,\u201d the officer\u2019s account read. She \u201cproceeded through a metal detector and was screened before she proceeds to the secure side of the airport.\u201d\n\nThen, several hours prior to ending up on the plane, Small walked around the airport, according to police who reviewed airport footage after the incident. She spent several hours apparently wandering \u2013 getting on trains and coming back to where she started in the airport. Then she would pick up items at different stores and move them around, the report alleges.\n\nThe Delta flight she eventually boarded wasn\u2019t her first attempt to get on a plane.\n\nOne officer viewed footage showing her trying to \u201cget into line as if to board a flight at least two times.\u201d She tried on December 23 at 10:12 p.m. at gate N15 and again at 10:47 p.m. at gate N9, where she stood next to the gate agent and took a step towards the jetway before turning around and seemingly deciding not to board.\n\nThen, at about 12:40 a.m. on Christmas Eve, an officer responded to a call about a suspicious person.\n\nThat call was from Sherwin Shayegan, known to police as the \u201cPiggyback Bandit.\u201d The responding officer said he had \u201cnumerous contacts\u201d with Shayegan in the past. He\u2019s been previously convicted for forcing high school boys into piggyback rides and for giving children money after he massages them.\n\nShayegan described the female and pointed her out to law enforcement.\n\nSmall was barefoot when she walked away from Shayegan and the officer, the records show. Shayegan told police he didn\u2019t think Small had a ticket because she had a bottle of Fireball whiskey on her and he believed she stole it, the police report says.\n\nThe officer followed Small down the terminal until she went into a women\u2019s restroom. Two officers waited 15 to 20 minutes for her to exit and speak with her.\n\nFinally, an officer entered the bathroom and contacted Small, who said she needed more time. Officers left the bathroom and didn\u2019t have further contact with her until after she deplaned the Delta flight.\n\nBoarding the flight\n\nA Delta employee who reviewed video footage saw Small walk behind a male passenger in a black shirt at the gate counter and access the jet bridge, according to the public records. The male passenger scanned his ticket at the gate and Small \u201cwalked on the side of him to gain access to the jet bridge,\u201d the police records said.\n\nOnce they had boarded, a Delta customer service agent reported to law enforcement there were too many passengers aboard flight 487 departing to Honolulu at 12:45 p.m., according to the public records.\n\nOn the aircraft with the door closed, a woman, later identified as Small, was sitting in a ticketed passenger\u2019s seat and that was how Delta was able to discover her aboard the Airbus A321neo.\n\nSmall told a Delta agent her last name was Smith and said she did not have her ID, police reports show. Small was then told to follow the agent and avoided questions about how she got onboard. Police had not yet arrived at the gate.\n\nThe Delta agent followed her after she walked away from them until she entered the unsecure side of the airport, the public records show.\n\nAt approximately 1:07 p.m., Port of Seattle Police was dispatched to Gate B1 where Flight 487 was parked, for \u201csuspicious circumstances.\u201d Perry Cooper, a Port of Seattle official, said the person \u201cran out of the aircraft\u201d before law enforcement arrived at 1:13 p.m. Police records show she walked off toward baggage claim.\n\nPublic records show it took about 50 minutes from the time Small refused to show Delta agents her ID to when she was detained and read her Miranda rights at 1:55 p.m. Police found her washing her face in a women\u2019s restroom near a hall for arriving flights.\n\nWhen law enforcement approached her, records say she gave them a fake name and age, among other false details.\n\nA police officer detailed their difficulties in understanding Small in a case report.\n\n\u201cBased on my training and experience, not knowing how to spell a given name or correct, usually suggests that a subject is lying about their name,\u201d the officer wrote in the case report. \u201cIf a subject is dishonest about who they are, the subject is usually dishonest about their side of the story.\u201d\n\nSmall was charged with trespassing and false statements.\n\nDays later, she was arrested again at the Seattle airport on December 27 for criminal trespass without a ticket for a flight after an officer recognized her from her first arrest, court records show. Small has a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nCNN reached out to Small and her attorney for comment.\n\nAviation incidents raise alarms\n\nThere\u2019s recently been a string of aviation security incidents in the US.\n\nAnother stowaway boarded a Delta airplane Thanksgiving week. That unticketed passenger made it all the way from New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport to Paris before she was eventually arrested.\n\nAlso on Christmas Eve, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it traveled from Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport and landed in Maui.\n\nLast week, two people were found dead in the wheel well of a JetBlue plane from New York City after it landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nWhile the reports don\u2019t give a sense of Small\u2019s motives, experts say there are many reasons why a person might stow away on an aircraft. There\u2019s not just one reason that fits every bill, said Alexandra James, an analysis output manager at Osprey Flight Solutions, which analyzes security risks in the aviation sector.\n\nJames said sometimes, the cases she\u2019s seen include travelers who can\u2019t afford a ticket, suffer from mental health issues motivating a person to get on a flight and other reasons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can say that there\u2019s any one problem, but it just goes to show that aviation security personnel really need to keep all these different issues in view,\u201d James said. \u201cThey can\u2019t just be thinking about terrorism. They need to be thinking about mental health issues. They need to be thinking about people with other stuff going on that may potentially cause a cause a threat.\u201d",

            "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nWhen 35-year-old combat medic Tetyana Tsymbaliuk regained consciousness in the hospital room, she found her boyfriend waiting with a bunch of flowers. He proposed, but she declined. After a serious injury, her leg had been amputated; she worried about being a burden as a wife.\n\n\u201cI realized that before amputation, I was more attractive. I was not sure that I could find a way to fulfil my family role as a woman,\u201d said Tsymbaliuk. It took her a long time to regain her confidence.\n\nTsymbaliuk says she was one of the first Ukrainian military amputees following the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Almost three years on, nearly 370,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been wounded. Thousands have lost one or more limbs.\n\nWhile the government does not provide official figures on amputations, a state program issued prostheses to almost 20,000 people across 2023 and the first half of 2024, and many others were helped by private programs in Ukraine and abroad.\n\nIn the past two years, Ukraine has implemented protocols for physical and, to some degree, psychological rehabilitation for those injured in conflict. But sexual rehabilitation for people who have lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries has been largely overlooked.\n\nSex has long been a taboo topic in Ukraine. While modern Ukrainians are more open about sex than in the Soviet era, the topic is still an uncomfortable one for many.\n\n\u201cIn our culture, we don\u2019t really have a habit of talking about sex. Not all people can even say this word calmly. It is generally not acceptable to tell a stranger or even a partner about your sex issues,\u201d military psychologist and sexologist Hanna Revunets told CNN, adding that men or women who have lost limbs because of the war rarely ask for help regarding such a sensitive subject.\n\n\u201cIf I ask veterans about sex issues, they usually say that everything is okay. Only a few of them after a while, when they start to trust me, can talk about the problems they have,\u201d Revunets said.\n\nCombat medic Tetyana Tsymbaliuk suffered a serious injury requiring amputation in May 2022, soon after the Russian invasion. She has undergone a long rehabilitation process and, last year, had a baby. Kostiantyn and Vlada Liberovy/Superhumans Center\n\nThere are no protocols or recommendations for sexual rehabilitation on the official governmental level, she said, or even any mention of it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important because the doctor is required to work according to protocol,\u201d Revunets said. \u201cSexual rehabilitation is not specified anywhere, so the doctor can only take the initiative if he or she wants to do so. But most doctors aren\u2019t ready to talk about it.\u201d\n\nIt takes time even to persuade some doctors of its significance, Revunets said. \u201cWhen I tell my colleagues about the importance of sexual rehabilitation, they look at me as if I\u2019m crazy, (someone) who doesn\u2019t understand what kind of serious injuries the patient has,\u201d she said.\n\nA good sexologist can help in many ways. Revunets is one of the very few sexologists in the country who works with the military. \u201cI find out what exactly is wrong with the patient. I ask how the person feels. Depending on this, I give advice - it can be advice on how and what to do from a technical point of view, or what medications to take, or help psychologically.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was told to have sex, but no one told me how\u2019\n\nThe war has resulted in an unprecedented number of people with injuries, a situation for which Ukraine was unprepared. The lack of any information on sexual rehabilitation has motivated the Ukrainian nonprofit Veteran Hub, which is specifically dedicated to supporting war veterans and their families, to study the topic.\n\nIn 2023, Veteran Hub researchers conducted 39 in-depth interviews with injured soldiers and their partners. Among other things, interviewees spoke anonymously about their sex lives after injury.\n\nResearchers found that sex itself had changed for many. For example, after being injured, some respondents started to prepare for or plan sexual relations due to physical changes.\n\nOne of the veterans in a long-term relationship said of the doctors who treated him: \u201cI was told to have sex, but no one told me how. If we\u2019re talking about the technical part, it is very important.\u201d He told researchers that without formal resources available to them, men were having to pass on information \u201cby word of mouth.\u201d\n\nIn response to the researchers\u2019 findings, Veteran Hub created a guide for veterans on how to restore their sexual lives after being wounded.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there was a great demand for this topic. After physical rehabilitation, people start asking themselves whether they will be able to swim in the sea, go skiing, go on dates, or have sex. And usually no one can answer these questions,\u201d said Veteran Hub project manager Kateryna Skorohod.\n\nOlga Serdyuk, chief executive of the Olena Pinchuk Foundation, which runs a sexual educational program at a network of rehabilitation centers called Recovery, said: \u201cWe need to understand that a wounded person works with different specialists \u2013 surgeons, physiotherapists, psychologists \u2013 on the way to rehabilitation. Because there is a lack of sexologists in Ukraine, those doctors must be ready for the person to open up to them and talk about sexual rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nTo help widen their knowledge, Recovery launched a course called \u201cSexual Life\u201d to train doctors and other professionals working with Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nSerious injury changes the life of not only the veteran but also their partner, Serdyuk explained.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, Ukrainian society believes that a good wife should take care of her husband on her own, even if there is an opportunity to get help. A woman becomes a carer. What kind of sex can we talk about then?\u201d Serdyuk said, referring to how the pressures of full-time caring can lessen a couple\u2019s capacity to explore paths to sexual fulfilment.\n\n\u201cEven if we are talking about complete dysfunction or missing genitals, a person (who\u2019s been injured) can still have an orgasm with pleasure. You have to work with your fantasies, study your body.\u201d\n\nPeople need to learn to accept themselves in a new way, and believe in their integrity, their body, Serdyuk said.\n\nUkrainian \u2018Bachelor\u2019 stars double amputee\n\nDiscussions surrounding disabilities are increasingly cropping up in Ukraine as casualties rise.\n\nPopular dating show \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has taken the discussion into the mainstream, with 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko \u2013 who lost both his legs in the war - cast as the star of the latest season.\n\nAn episode with an intimate scene, shown in November, became one of the most popular in the season. According to data provided by Starlight Media, a Ukrainian broadcasting group, about 2.8 million people all around the country watched it, making it the most viewed program on the day it aired.\n\nAn episode of the TV show \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d featured an intimate scene with the season's star, 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko, who lost both his legs in the war. STB Channel/Starlight Media\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in the history of the show among all countries of the world that a man with a double amputation has become a Bachelor,\u201d show producer Anna Kalyna told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about how people would react to seeing a person\u2019s body with visible amputations in such an intimate context. There is no representation of people living with injuries in Ukraine and we didn\u2019t know how people would react to it. It was a big challenge. But it turned out well.\u201d\n\nKalyna thinks the audience was interested, in part, because they realize that in this time of war their own loved ones could be injured at any moment.\n\nOn his Instagram page, Budko said he was not taking part in the show to convince anyone of anything or prove his \u201cnormality.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy prostheses or even sometimes a wheelchair are just a part of me, but not what defines me,\u201d he posted. \u201cThe fact that I have a disability does not make me less worthy of love or a happy life. And this is important to understand.\u201d\n\nBudko also posted that his first experience of sex after injury \u201cwas not just sex, but a step back to life.\u201d\n\nChoosing life over suffering\n\nAmong those to attend Recovery\u2019s \u201cSexual Life\u201d course is Oleksandr Batalov. The unit infantry commander, who works as an osteopath in civil life, lost his leg in a fierce battle on the front line. He recalls that it took time for him to get used to his changed body.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, with such trauma, you want no one to look at you. But my wife gave me huge support. So, I got a grip. I chose life, not suffering,\u201d he said. The psychologist helped a lot, he added.\n\nThere are very few sexologists in the hospitals, he said, but men who have experienced serious injuries are talking about sex with one another, and that\u2019s important. However, \u201cthey need to have specialists they can talk to\u201d as well, Batalov said.\n\nWar veteran Oleksandr Batalov attended the Recovery network's \"Sexual Life\" course after losing his leg on the battlefield and hopes to share his knowledge with others. CNN\n\nThat\u2019s why he is starting this course. \u201cIf you survived, you have to live. Despite the injury, my life is full and interesting, I want to leave and study and share the knowledge,\u201d said Batalov, who is now working again as an osteopath.\n\nThe same goes for Tsymbaliuk, the injured combat medic. She decided to live a fulfilling life no matter what. Her boyfriend did not give up and proposed again.\n\nAfter months of rehabilitation in Germany, and later in Ukraine\u2019s Superhumans Center, she finally married him, realizing \u201cshe was full of love that she wanted to fulfil.\u201d Four months ago, they welcomed their first child together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding my prosthetic. I\u2019m living a full life. And I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Victoria Butenko contributed reporting.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThis week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan\u2019s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHow did the country get here?\n\nFor 20 months, two of Sudan\u2019s most powerful generals \u2013 Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more.\n\nSudan's top army general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan speaks during a press conference in 2021. Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe RSF's Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, is seen in Khartoum in 2023. Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters\n\nThe two men \u2013 former allies \u2013 jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from office in 2019. Together, they also contributed to another coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized power from the country\u2019s transitional government.\n\nToday, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country\u2019s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum.\n\nMore than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan.\n\nHunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned.\n\nWho has been cited as responsible?\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti\u2019s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated \u201cdirect attacks against civilians\u201d including the systematic murder of \u201cmen and boys \u2013 even infants \u2013 on an ethnic basis.\u201d\n\nThey also \u201cdeliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\u201d Blinken said, adding that the same forces \u201ctargeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,\u201d he announced.\n\nThe RSF described the decision by the US as \u201cunjust,\u201d adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that \u201cthe State Department\u2019s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide \u2026 The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,\u201d the RSF statement said.\n\nThe RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead.\n\nSince fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF, ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide.\n\nWest Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups were massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, \u201cfor his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,\u201d and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual \u201cfor their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.\u201d\n\nAre both warring factions complicit in abuses?\n\nIn September last year, a United Nations fact-finding mission accused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes.\n\nAnd in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. \u201cThe United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.\u201d\n\nSudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF.\n\nIn Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been \u201cused as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,\u201d \u2013 a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same method and strategy,\u201d she said of the alleged sexual crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.\u201d\n\nAl-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan\u2019s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said.\n\n\u201cThe RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,\u201d she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti.\n\nCivilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF \u2013 targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties.\n\nPeople gather near a destroyed vehicle, following shelling in Omdurman, Sudan on December 10, 2024. Khartoum State Government via Reuters\n\nLast month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency\u2019s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up \u201cthe deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,\u201d the UN said.\n\nDozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF\u2019s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October.\n\nThe RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking \u201cwidespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter but has not yet received a response.\n\nWhat is the impact on civilians?\n\nBefore the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world\u2019s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth.\n\nTheir war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures.\n\nSome of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur\u2019s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment.\n\nA woman and baby are seen at the Zamzam displacement camp, close to El Fasher in North Darfur, Sudan in 2018. Mohamed Zakaria/MSF/Reuters\n\nHunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people to eat \u201cgrass and peanut shells\u201d to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger.\n\nFood deliveries to Darfur resumed last August after a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week.\n\nOn Friday, humanitarian group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters.\n\n\u201cThe medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,\u201d MSF\u2019s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement.\n\nHow has the world responded to the war?\n\nThe Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year.\n\nHowever, warring factions in the African nation have also defied global efforts to end the conflict.\n\nLast month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were.\n\n\u201cTo the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries \u2013 enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict \u2013 enough,\u201d he said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken addresses the United Nations Security Council on Sudan in December 2024. Richard Drew/AP\n\nSudan\u2019s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: \u201cThe UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.\u201d\n\nA CNN investigation in 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time.\n\nIn November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan\u2019s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan\u2019s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia\u2019s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWill the US genocide determination make a difference?\n\nSudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US\u2019 determination of genocide in Sudan was \u201clong overdue\u201d and should have happened sooner.\n\nNonetheless, it is \u201ca form of justice because it recognizes victims\u2019 grievances,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,\u201d added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.\n\nFor activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.\u201d",

Along with these two companies, Airbnb is partnering with 211 LA, a community hub for Los Angeles County, to coordinate the distribution of emergency housing for individuals displaced by the wildfires.\n\nThe Hotel Association of Los Angeles (HALA) and Santa Monica Travel & Tourism have compiled lists of available hotels in Southern California to assist nearly 180,000 residents included in evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by the destruction of the fires raging across the Los Angeles region. Hotels are currently taking in thousands of Angelenos who have been displaced by the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires,\u201d HALA said in a statement.\n\nThe list will be updated yet may not accurately reflect current availability, a HALA spokesperson told CNN \u2013 residents are encouraged to contact hotels to find out about available discounts.\n\nFor context: Southern California\u2019s already challenging housing market is poised for further strain as thousands of families affected by the wildfires seek shelter, potentially for years to come. Real estate experts told CNN that the influx of demand from fire victims, combined with a dwindling supply of available homes, is likely to drive up both rental and purchase prices significantly.\n\nCalifornia law prohibits significant price increases on critical items, including rental housing, home repairs, emergency supplies like water and batteries, and medical necessities. Building materials such as lumber and tools, as well as gasoline and transportation tickets, are also protected under this legislation.\n\nBusinesses may raise prices by no more than 10% during emergencies unless they can provide valid justification for higher costs, according to Los Angeles County Consumer and Business Affairs.\n\nRead more about the region\u2019s affordable housing crisis here.",

Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nWhen Qatar\u2019s prime minister emerged Wednesday to declare \u2014 at long last \u2014 that a ceasefire-for-hostage deal had been struck in Gaza, representatives for two American administrations were on hand in Doha to bask in the victory.\n\nThe cooperation between the two was \u201calmost unprecedented,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said after the deal was clinched, made possible by a rare intersection of interests between bitter rivals who both saw an opening following Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nBrett McGurk, the longtime Middle East negotiator for President Joe Biden, had been planted in the Qatari capital for weeks in the hopes of a final agreement. He was joined in recent days by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for the final push.\n\nAt points, McGurk and Witkoff divvied up meetings across the Middle East to push the deal across the line, including critical talks between Witkoff and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that McGurk joined by phone. If McGurk was focused primarily on the parameters of the deal, Witkoff was on hand to emphasize Trump\u2019s desire to see a deal finished by Inauguration Day.\n\nAfter the agreement was announced, both the incoming and outgoing president took full credit, a sign the poisonous relationship between them endures.\n\nUltimately, however, the deal enables both Biden and Trump to claim victory. It notches a final bit of positive news for a president who is poised to leave office with the lowest approval rating of his term.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe first phase of the deal reached between Hamas and Israel on Wednesday includes a pause in the war and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli custody.\n\nBut several details and the timeline of the full deal remain unclear and will be key to its success moving forward.\n\nThe deal represents the second ceasefire since the war started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants launched an attack into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. The military offensive launched by Israel in response has killed at least 46,645 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nThe first ceasefire, in November 2023, lasted about a week. In that period, 105 hostages being held by Hamas \u2013 primarily women, children and elderly people \u2013 were released, while Israel released about 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\n\nThe current ceasefire deal is set up to progress in three distinct phases.\n\nPhase one is expected to start at some point Sunday and last for six weeks. This phase will feature a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli troops, a swap of hostages and prisoners, and an influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza. US hostages held in Gaza will be released in that first phase, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.\n\nThe second and third phases are less developed, and the details will be decided during the first phase, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a briefing Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to do everything we can, everything possible together with our partners, to ensure that this deal is implemented as it\u2019s agreed,\u201d he said, noting that mediators had spent 411 days working on the agreement terms. \u201cAnd this deal will bring us peace, hopefully, at the end of it. I believe that it all depends on the parties of the agreement acting in good faith in that agreement in order to ensure that no collapse happens to that deal.\u201d\n\nHamas hailed the deal on Wednesday as a \u201ccrucial turning point.\u201d Israel\u2019s cabinet must still vote to approve the deal before it goes into effect.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what\u2019s in the current ceasefire deal and the steps ahead.\n\nSupporters of Israeli hostages react to news on the Gaza ceasefire negotiations in Tel Aviv, Israel, January 15, 2025. Ronen Zvulun/Reuters\n\nCeasefire, Israeli withdrawal and aid\n\nThe ceasefire deal would deliver the first reprieve from war for the people of Gaza in more than a year, and only the second since the Israeli bombardment began.\n\nThe Israeli military would begin withdrawing from population centers during the first phase, but would remain along the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, an Israeli official said Wednesday. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the size of which has been one of the final sticking points in the negotiations.\n\nThe deal is expected to allow Palestinian civilians to return to their homes across Gaza, including in the devastated north. There would be a massive influx of humanitarian aid into the strip, where residents have long faced dire humanitarian conditions, Al Thani said.\n\nGaza\u2019s wounded will also be allowed to leave the enclave to receive treatment, while aid will be allowed into the strip with hospitals and bakeries undergoing repairs, he said.\n\nWhich hostages and prisoners will be released?\n\nAs part of that first phase, Hamas and its allied militant groups will release 33 hostages in the first phase, including female soldiers, children, the elderly and the sick, Al Thani said.\n\nUnder the deal, American hostages being held by Hamas \u201cwill be part of that hostage release on phase one,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThree female Israeli civilian hostages are expected to be released on the first day of the ceasefire and then on the seventh day, Hamas is set to release four more, according to a document shared by senior Hamas official Bassem Naim.\n\nFollowing that, \u201cHamas will release three Israeli detainees every seven days, starting with women (civilians and soldiers),\u201d the document states.\n\n\u201cDuring the sixth week, Hamas will release all remaining detainees included in this stage, and in return, Israel will release the agreed upon number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons, based on lists provided by Hamas,\u201d the document continues.\n\nAccording to the document, Israel will release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were arrested on October 8, 2023, but were not involved in Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel the day before. Of the 33 hostages Hamas is expected to release, nine who are ill and injured will be exchanged for 110 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, according to the document.\n\nHamas and its allies hold 94 people taken from Israel on October 7, 2023. Of those, at least 34 are dead, according to the Israeli government, though the true number is expected to be higher. Eighty-one of the hostages are men and 13 are women. Eighty-four are from Israel, while eight are from Thailand, one is from Nepal, and one is from Tanzania.\n\nHamas holds an additional four hostages held captive since 2014, at least two of whom are dead.\n\nIsrael holds at least 10,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to the Commission of Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society \u2013 though that number does not include an unknown number of Palestinians taken captive in Gaza. The figure of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel includes 3,376 people held under administrative detention, meaning they have neither had public charges against them nor faced trial, including 95 children and 22 women.\n\nSecond and third phases to be negotiated\n\nThe second and third phases of the ceasefire still have to be negotiated during the first. Those negotiations will begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal, according to an Israeli official.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at the White House about a ceasefire deal in Gaza on Wednesday, Jan. 15. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nThe ceasefire is not guaranteed to continue beyond the first phase of the deal. However, the official said Israel is eager to \u201cbring all our hostages back home,\u201d and will enter negotiations for the second phase in good faith, which could lead to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nBiden said the second and third phases will include a release of further hostages and the beginning of Gaza\u2019s rebuild.\n\n\u201cWhen phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza, and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, under phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families, and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin.\u201d\n\nHow the deal will be enforced\n\nIn response to a question from CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson, Al Thani said the US, Egypt and Qatar have put a mechanism in place to ensure neither side breaks the ceasefire.\n\n\u201cIt will be placed in Cairo, and this follow-up actually will be a joint team from the three countries that will monitor the implementation of the agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything has been agreed upon and will be in place, hopefully, on the day of the execution.\u201d\n\nAl Thani said this ceasefire deal was different from the one in November 2023 that lasted just a week.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the agreement in November was very transactional. So it was like a day-by-day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this agreement has a clear mechanism for the first 42 days, and there is a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three, and all the details of the agreements will be published in the next couple of days once the details are finalized.\u201d",

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nReducing your red meat consumption could have many positive impacts \u2014 on your heart, the environment, and maybe even on your long-term cognitive health, according to a new study.\n\nThose who ate a quarter of a serving or more of processed red meats \u2014 such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs \u2014 had a 13% higher chance of developing dementia than those who had less than one-tenth of a serving per day, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nA serving of red meat is usually around 3 ounces, which would be either two slices of bacon, 1.5 slices of bologna or one hot dog, according to a news release on the study.\n\nResearchers also found that an extra daily serving of processed red meat on average was associated with a 1.6-year acceleration in brain aging, according to the study.\n\nThe study methods are observational, meaning that researchers can\u2019t say for sure that the processed red meats are causing the dementia, only that there is an association between the two. But investigation into the connection will continue, said one of the study\u2019s authors, Dr. Daniel Wang, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\u201cLarge, long-term cohort studies are essential for investigating conditions like dementia, which can develop over decades,\u201d Wang said in a news release. \u201cWe are continuing to piece together this story to understand the mechanisms causing dementia and cognitive decline.\u201d\n\nGetting protein from plants such as beans, legumes and nuts instead of red meat may help protect your cognitive health, according to a new study. Spencer Platt/Getty Images/File\n\nWhy the meat you eat affects your brain\n\nThe connection between red meat and cognitive health hasn\u2019t been studied thoroughly, but researchers have found associations with many other health outcomes, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancers and premature death, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School. He was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cIn particular, processed red meat shows the strongest association due to its high content in salt, heme iron, and harmful additives used for processing,\u201d Song said in an email.\n\n\u201cAlso, the inflammatory response and metabolic disturbances (eg, insulin resistance) associated with high red meat consumption may also play a role,\u201d he added in an email.\n\nFor this study, researchers analyzed data from more than 133,000 people at an average age of 49 from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. The data included detailed health information surveyed over a long period of time, including participants\u2019 diets, and was updated every two to four years, according to the study.\n\nMore than 11,000 study participants were diagnosed with dementia within a 43-year window.\n\nThere are theories as to why red meat might pose a particular risk to cognitive health. Red meat has a high amount of saturated fat and yields an organic compound linked to cardiovascular disease, and the two together may damage the nervous system, which worsens cognitive decline, Song said.\n\nProcessed red meat also has higher levels of substances such as nitrites, N-nitroso compounds and sodium, which pose additional risks to cognitive decline, said the study\u2019s lead author, Yuhan Li, a research assistant in the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nNitrites are ingredients often used in curing meats and have been linked to health concerns, and N-nitroso compounds are also found in cured meats and have been linked to cancer.\n\nThis latest study is important for emphasizing how the food you eat affects the way your brain ages, Wang said in the news release.\n\n\u201cDietary guidelines tend to focus on reducing risks of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes, while cognitive health is less frequently discussed, despite being linked to these diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope our results encourage greater consideration of the connection between diet and brain health.\u201d\n\nLimiting the red meat you eat\n\nReducing the amount of red meat you eat could be an important part of caring for your long-term health, according to the study.\n\nReplacing red meat with plant-based protein sources such as nuts and legumes was associated with a 19% lower risk of dementia and 1.37 fewer years of cognitive aging, according to the study.\n\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research recommends limiting your red meat to three portions a week and eating little if any processed red meat.\n\nWhile making specific changes may help your health, the overall quality of a person\u2019s diet is the main priority, Song said in an earlier CNN article.\n\nIf you want to cut back and eat in a more nutrient-dense way, it might be time to look into the Mediterranean diet \u2013\u2013 which is more of a lifestyle than a restrictive diet.\n\nIt focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, grains, olive oil, nuts and seeds, and the occasional piece of fish while also focusing on social connection and physical activity.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is weighing a plan that could delay America\u2019s TikTok ban, giving the new administration more time to potentially cut a deal with a US buyer to save the super-popular video app, sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nThe potential executive order, which was first reported by The Washington Post, would strive to allow TikTok\u2019s 170 million American users to continue to use the app for a certain period of time as the administration sorts out who could potentially buy it.\n\nTrump, who supported a TikTok ban as president, has recently said he wants to keep the app alive \u2013 even posting a TikTok video in June in which he said he wanted to \u201csave TikTok.\u201d Last month, he asked the Supreme Court to stay the law so his incoming administration could work out a deal to keep TikTok available to Americans.\n\nStill, Trump may ultimately decline to act. As the deadline draws closer, Trump \u2013 who\u2019s never shied away from overt suggestions for the executive and judicial branches \u2013 has otherwise sat this one out.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance, its China-based owner, have less than 4 days left before the app is banned in the United States \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t sell itself to an American buyer.\n\nTikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app.\n\nThe ban would take effect Sunday, pending a Supreme Court decision that is expected to come soon. America\u2019s highest court, however, appears poised to keep the law that bans TikTok in place.\n\nBecause the ban would take place a day before Trump takes office, an executive order on January 20 wouldn\u2019t even be an 11th-hour attempt to save TikTok \u2013 it would have already been banned at that point.\n\nThe Biden possibility\n\nThat is, unless President Joe Biden takes action first.\n\nSome lawmakers have urged Biden to delay the ban before it takes effect. Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul wrote to Biden in December, urging him to exercise an extension under the Protecting Americans\u2019 Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, which provides the legal basis for banning TikTok and other foreign-owned apps deemed a national security threat.\n\n\u201cThe stakes here are high: As a practical matter, even if the Court rules that the law is constitutional by the January deadline, ByteDance cannot divest TikTok in that limited time,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter, sent December 19.\n\nThe law provides the president the authority to impose a one-time extension of up to 90 days. But triggering the extension requires Biden to prove to Congress that parties working on purchasing TikTok have made significant progress, including binding legal agreements for such a deal. Given ByteDance\u2019s adamance that the company is not for sale, that evidence would seem to be nonexistent.\n\nSo it appears unlikely Biden could step in \u2013 even if he wanted to slow-roll the bill he signed after it was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress.\n\nTikTok\u2019s uncertain future\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order would be another climb in a rollercoaster ride for an app that appears ready to shut its lights off Sunday and \u201cgo dark,\u201d as the company\u2019s lawyer, Noel Francisco, told the Supreme Court Friday. TikTok has fought the ban for years. But Reuters and The Information reported Wednesday the app is preparing to shut itself down entirely Sunday, giving its users the option to collect their data while restricting access to videos.\n\nTikTok declined to comment on the possibilities Trump or Biden could take action to save the app.\n\nBut even if TikTok shuts itself down Sunday, that doesn\u2019t mean it would go dark forever. It could ultimately sell itself to an American buyer down the road, which would presumably turn TikTok back on for American users.\n\nAnother option: TikTok could do nothing on Sunday, hoping that Trump\u2019s potential executive order would give it the ability to remain online. The law doesn\u2019t really force TikTok to do anything at all. It\u2019s on the US-based companies that support TikTok to take action.\n\nSo, on Sunday, a very real possibility is that people won\u2019t notice much of a change at all. Apple and Google probably will remove the app\u2019s listing from their app stores, but people who have already downloaded the app could continue to use it if TikTok does nothing.\n\nThe enforcement mechanism for the new law would be the US Justice Department, which is changing hands at noon the day after the ban and which would have wide discretion to enforce the law (or not). So if Trump\u2019s executive order says his administration won\u2019t enforce the ban, TikTok may place a bet that all of the companies that host and support TikTok\u2019s content will be willing to break the letter of the law with the understanding that they won\u2019t be punished for it.\n\nThat\u2019s probably not a long-term viable option, however: No one would be able to access the app if they got a new phone or never downloaded the app in the first place, for example. And it would become illegal for companies like Oracle that host TikTok\u2019s content in the United States to continue to serve it to the app\u2019s users. That could force TikTok to serve content from outside the US, degrading service.\n\nThe possibility of a sale\n\nThat\u2019s why a sale may be the only way TikTok ultimately remains available for American users.\n\nByteDance has long been adamant that it has no intention of selling itself. TikTok\u2019s magical algorithm that keeps you hooked on the app is its secret power, and putting a price tag on such a valuable commodity, envied by every other social media app, is difficult. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users\u2019 content. Yet Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that China is weighing a sale \u2014 to Elon Musk.\n\nMusk may have the resources to buy the app, and he\u2019s a major Trump supporter and about to take a quasi-role in his government. Other candidates, including \u201cShark Tank\u2019s\u201d Kevin O\u2019Leary and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, have also made an offer for TikTok.\n\nO\u2019Leary and McCourt\u2019s bid, valuing the app at roughly $20 billion, is partly crowdfunded from the public. But it would not include an acquisition of the app\u2019s algorithm, the key to its success and also US officials\u2019 biggest security concern. O\u2019Leary tells CNN the offer has been disseminated to interested parties, but it remains unclear whether the company will choose to engage.\n\n\u201cBoth administrations have seen the offer and have access to it, as do all American shareholders of ByteDance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in an interview. \u201cAnd we have made sure ByteDance itself has it in its possession.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Leary met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week to discuss the outlook for the app.\n\nIf ByteDance chooses to engage, Trump could perhaps argue that significant progress has been made on a deal and delay the ban.\n\nA Trump executive order would be only a step in the process to keep TikTok online \u2013 not the be-all and end-all for the app. But it might keep the lights on just a little longer.\n\nCNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed reporting.",

            "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Qatar\u2019s prime minister emerged Wednesday to declare \u2014 at long last \u2014 that a ceasefire-for-hostage deal had been struck in Gaza, representatives for two American administrations were on hand in Doha to bask in the victory.\n\nThe cooperation between the two was \u201calmost unprecedented,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said after the deal was clinched, made possible by a rare intersection of interests between bitter rivals who both saw an opening following Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nBrett McGurk, the longtime Middle East negotiator for President Joe Biden, had been planted in the Qatari capital for weeks in the hopes of a final agreement. He was joined in recent days by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for the final push.\n\nAt points, McGurk and Witkoff divvied up meetings across the Middle East to push the deal across the line, including critical talks between Witkoff and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that McGurk joined by phone. If McGurk was focused primarily on the parameters of the deal, Witkoff was on hand to emphasize Trump\u2019s desire to see a deal finished by Inauguration Day.\n\nAfter the agreement was announced, both the incoming and outgoing president took full credit, a sign the poisonous relationship between them endures.\n\nUltimately, however, the deal enables both Biden and Trump to claim victory. It notches a final bit of positive news for a president who is poised to leave office with the lowest approval rating of his term. And it bolsters the bonafides of a president-elect who vowed \u201call hell would break out\u201d in Gaza if the hostages were not released before his second inauguration.\n\nThe reality of who is responsible for the deal is complex. Biden administration officials say momentum toward a deal began before the election, after a separate ceasefire was struck between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The contours of the final agreement with Hamas map closely with a proposal Biden first unveiled in May, but was unable to complete.\n\nSpeaking at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month, Witkoff said Biden\u2019s team was the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d in the talks.\n\n\u201cNo one has pride of authorship. We are totally outcome oriented. Let\u2019s get them home,\u201d Witkoff, a former real estate investor, said then.\n\nStill, after the deal was struck, even Biden officials acknowledged the deadline of Trump\u2019s entry into office was a motivating factor in finally finding success after months of failure. And Trump, who was monitoring developments from Florida, was quick to declare the agreement was only made possible by his win.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,\u201d he wrote on social media.\n\nBiden was more circumspect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good afternoon,\u201d Biden said Wednesday from the White House Cross Hall, steps from where members of the incoming Trump team were meeting with their Biden administration counterparts in the West Wing to discuss national security matters.\n\nThe president, who has decades of high-level foreign policy experience, described the talks that led to the ceasefire deal as \u201cone of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d He said his team had been \u201cspeaking as one\u201d with Trump officials.\n\nBut asked as he was stepping away from the podium who deserves credit for Wednesday\u2019s deal \u2013 himself or Trump \u2013 the president flashed his annoyance:\n\n\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d he said before walking away.\n\nMonths of talks starting, stopping\n\nBy the final stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign, few inside the White House believed a hostage deal could be achieved before the results of the election were known.\n\nAmerican and European officials saw Netanyahu as biding his time, waiting to see which US president he\u2019d be dealing with going forward \u2013 and keeping his options open for any outcome.\n\nHours of angry phone calls between the White House and Netanyahu\u2019s office had yielded little progress, and even the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar did not immediately shake loose a deal.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory \u2013 widely seen inside the White House as Netanyahu\u2019s preferred result \u2013 was hardly the outcome any Biden\u2019s aides were hoping for. In their loss, though, some saw a fresh opportunity.\n\nSo during a post-election meeting with Trump in front of a roaring Oval Office fire, Biden had a request for the man who\u2019d be replacing him in a few months: Work with the administration\u2019s team to get the hostages out of Gaza.\n\nIn conversations between the incoming and outgoing national security teams, Biden\u2019s aides made clear that whatever acrimony existed between the two men \u2013 and despite their friendly chat in the Oval Office, they remained bitterly opposed \u2013 the issue of the hostages was a place they must work together.\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re prepared to work with the incoming team in common cause on a bipartisan basis to do everything in our collective American power to secure the release of the hostages, both living and deceased,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the week after the November election.\n\nA mutually beneficial agreement\n\nIn their fireside conversation, Biden and Trump came to an agreement that the hostage matter could and should be resolved before the hand-off of power on January 20, according to people who heard about the meeting afterward.\n\nThe timing suited both men.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers have long felt that any agreement struck after his victory, but prior to him taking office, would enable him to take credit for it. It would also take the issue off his plate as he begins a second presidency squarely focused on fulfilling his campaign pledges on immigration, tariffs and dismantling Biden-era regulations.\n\nFor Biden, having finally secured the hostage deal he\u2019s spent more than a quarter of his presidency trying to cement would validate time and energy \u2013 and political capital \u2013 lost to the cause.\n\nAnd so, with both men\u2019s blessing, the two opposing sides set to work on a final, last-week push to achieve what had for so long seemed impossible.\n\nLate nights and final demands\n\nA critical sticking point that had emerged over the past several months was Hamas\u2019 refusal to acknowledge how many hostages it was still holding, or to identify which hostages it would release as part of the first phase of the deal, according to the senior administration official.\n\nAmerican officials made clear to Hamas through its intermediaries that no agreement could be realized without a full list of hostages that would be released as part of the deal.\n\nThe pressure appeared to work. By late December, Hamas had agreed to provide the list, accelerating talks to reach the final-stage negotiations toward a deal.\n\nMcGurk remained in the Middle East working toward completing the complex agreement, including finalizing details on the sequencing of how and when prisoners would be released.\n\nHoled up inside a building in Doha, negotiators from the US, Israel, Qatar and Egypt, along with Hamas officials, talked until 3 a.m. as the sides attempted to finalize what had been a frustratingly elusive deal to end the conflict.\n\nHamas raised a number of last minute demands during the final negotiations. But the American and Israeli sides held firm as they pushed Hamas to agree.\n\nImplementation of the deal could begin as early as Sunday, an official said.\n\nAs the reality of the deal sank in, Netanyahu got on the phone with his American counterparts. His first call was to Trump, to thank him and arrange a meeting in Washington. Next, he called Biden and \u201cthanked him as well,\u201d according to a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office.",
