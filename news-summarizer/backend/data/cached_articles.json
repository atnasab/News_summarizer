            "text": "The weather pattern that will bring the coldest temperatures of the year to the Eastern US will also prevent rainfall and potentially bring another Santa Ana Wind event to Southern California next week.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Los Angeles warns of a 60% chance of red flag warnings being issued on Monday and an 80% chance of red flag warnings being issued on Tuesday.\n\nThe greatest chance remains that these winds will be between 30-50 mph, and while these gusts are lower than previous events, dry air and the rapidly increasing drought could cause any new fires to quickly spread out of control.\n\nThis upcoming weather pattern will prevent rainfall across Southern California, which has seen almost no rainfall since the start of October. Los Angeles has only seen 0.03 inches of rainfall since October 1, a far cry from the more than 5 inches they should receive in that time period.\n\nLos Angeles has also seen no rainfall in January, which is usually the city\u2019s second wettest month after February. The Climate Prediction Center\u2019s February outlook isn\u2019t giving promising news for Southern California, only calling for normal amounts of rainfall for the month. The city needs significant rounds of rainfall to climb out of this rainfall deficit.\n\nWith the series of Santa Ana winds further drying out Southern California and a lack of rainfall ongoing for the region, drought across the region has increased significantly. With the latest drought numbers released today, nearly all of Southern California is in severe drought, or a level 2 of 4.\n\nLos Angeles County is now 90% in severe drought when just two weeks ago when last week nearly 60% of the county was in severe drought. Just two weeks ago, no severe drought was reported in the county.",

            "title": "Russia-Iran treaty will raise the stakes for Trump\u2019s administration",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJust three days before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, Russia and Iran are set to finally sign a \u201ccomprehensive partnership agreement,\u201d a deal that\u2019s been in the works for months.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that will refocus attention on a partnership that has shaped the battlefield in Ukraine, and which remains committed to challenging the US-led international order - even as the new US administration promises greater engagement with Russia.\n\nRussian and Iran share a complicated past, peppered with conflict, and even now tread a fine line between cooperation and mistrust. And yet, the war in Ukraine has pulled Moscow and Tehran closer.\n\n\u201cThat idea of having the United States not just as an adversary but as a strategic objective of all of their foreign policy has brought them together,\u201d Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, D.C., told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s brought them together on the battlefields of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn July 2022, five months into his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran, his first wartime trip outside the former Soviet sphere.\n\nBehind the photo ops and handshakes, his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was not going to plan. His army had lost a lot of its initial gains as it was pushed out of the Kyiv region - and would go on to lose more later that year in two further successful Ukrainian counteroffensives.\n\nTurning to Tehran bore fruit for Russia. Thanks to a deal inked following that visit, Russia is now churning out thousands of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones, at a factory in Tatarstan. A CNN investigation in December found production rates at the facility had more than doubled in 2024.\n\nThose drones have formed the backbone of Moscow\u2019s attritional war, swarms of them \u2013 targeting civilian areas and energy infrastructure in an effort to break the resolve of Ukraine\u2019s people and deplete its air defenses.\n\nRussia deployed over 11,000 in Ukraine last year, according to a CNN tally of air force reports, more than four times the estimate of just over 2,500 in 2023, provided by CNN\u2019s sources in Ukraine\u2019s defense intelligence.\n\nFirefighters extinguish a fire at an oil depot following a Russian kamikaze drone strike on Kharkiv, Ukraine, in February 2024. Viacheslav Mavrychev/Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\n\nMoscow has also, according to the US, taken delivery of Iranian ballistic missiles \u2013 and while no evidence of their alleged deployment has surfaced yet, that news alone sent a strong signal to Ukraine\u2019s allies that Putin was willing to escalate.\n\nLess desirably for Moscow, it was also one factor that helped shift the debate around providing Ukraine with permission to fire Western-supplied long-range missiles at military targets in Russia. Several prominent Russian military bloggers claimed in early January, without providing evidence, that Iranian missile launchers and other equipment were being delivered to Russian military training grounds ahead of the deal\u2019s signing.\n\nTwo-and-a-half years on from Putin\u2019s Tehran visit, the dynamic has markedly shifted for both sides. Russia now has the advantage in Ukraine. It is gaining territory on the eastern front, and with the help of North Korean soldiers, slowly pushing Ukraine back in the Russian region of Kursk. The incoming Trump administration, to Moscow\u2019s barely concealed glee, wants to start talks, and is making noises about letting Russia keep the territory it occupies, and stalling Ukraine\u2019s bid for NATO membership.\n\nFriday\u2019s meeting between Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offers Moscow a welcome opportunity to burnish its self-image as a superpower. Russia sees this relationship as \u201casymmetric,\u201d Jean-Loup Samaan, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. \u201cThey still consider themselves as the bigger partner here, and Iran as a regional partner.\u201d\n\nIran, meanwhile, is feeling decidedly less secure. Nikita Smagin, an independent expert on Russia and Iran, who worked for Russian state media in Tehran before the invasion of Ukraine, says the Pezeshkian administration is rushing to get this treaty signed with Russia amid multiple threats to its security.\n\n\u201cThey are frightened by the Trump administration, they are frightened by Israel, they are frightened by the collapse of Assad, the collapse of Hezbollah,\u201d he said, explaining that Iran is looking for a show of support.\n\nMoscow may look to exploit this. The Russians have \u201ca great nose for somebody in trouble,\u201d said Alterman, and may be thinking \u201cwe can help them a little bit, but we can get them where we need them and extract more from them that we want.\u201d\n\nWhat more Russia wants is less clear. It has now indigenized Shahed production on Russian soil - and having paid its dues to Iran under an initial franchise deal to manufacture them, is now doing so with much less direct Iranian involvement.\n\nRussia\u2019s recent battlefield gains have come at a huge cost to its troops - so while its manpower issues are nowhere near the level of Ukraine\u2019s, it could use more boots on the ground. But experts are skeptical Iran would be as amenable in this regard as North Korea, which has deployed around 11,000 of its troops in Russia\u2019s Kursk region, according to Ukrainian and Western assessments.\n\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Savelev in Tehran, Iran, in December. Wana News Agency/Reuters\n\n\u201cEven when Iran is fighting their wars outside Iran, they are not willing\u2026 to sacrifice their soldiers,\u201d said Smagin, \u201cand when we\u2019re talking about Iran and Russia there is a very big background of distrust from the Iranian side to Russia.\u201d And Russia may be wary of any mutual defense pact, given the more immediate threat to Iran from Israel.\n\n\u201cI think this is partly intended as a message to the Trump administration that we each have options,\u201d said Alterman. \u201cI think the Iranians are looking for tools they can use with the Americans\u2026 and there\u2019s a sense that this gives them something to trade or something to talk about.\u201d\n\nIran, facing the prospect of a possible revival of UN sanctions that were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal, is urgently looking for ways to persuade the US to rejoin that deal, which Trump exited in 2018 - or restart negotiations.\n\nFor Russia, a new treaty with Iran \u2013 a country which might be closer than ever to being capable of producing a nuclear weapon \u2013 may be partly about dangling the specter of further escalation before a new US administration that it sees as less committed to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians certainly have some worrying capabilities, the Russians certainly have demonstrated a willingness to use worrying capabilities,\u201d Alterman said.",

            "text": "Seoul, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol failed in their court effort to secure his release on Thursday, a day after he was detained at his residence for questioning over rebellion allegations linked to his martial law declaration last month.\n\nYoon was sent to a detention center near the country\u2019s capital, Seoul, after undergoing more than 10 hours of questioning on Wednesday at the headquarters of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, during which he exercised his right to remain silent. Yoon refused further questioning by the anti-corruption officials on Thursday as his lawyers maintained that the investigation was illegal.\n\nLawyers had asked the Seoul Central District Court to consider his release, questioning the validity of the detention warrant for Yoon issued by the Seoul Western District Court.\n\nBut the Central District Court denied their petition late Thursday.\n\nYoon had avoided several requests to appear for questioning before the anti-corruption agency and police carried out a major law enforcement operation involving hundreds of personnel to detain him at his residential compound in Seoul.\n\nInvestigators are expected to move to place him under arrest in the coming days.\n\nThe anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration amounted to attempted rebellion, has 48 hours either to request a court order for his formal arrest or to release him.\n\nOn Thursday, his lawyers formally declared that Wednesday\u2019s raid at the presidential residence, which led to the detention of a head of state, was illegal, in complaints filed with prosecutors.\n\nYoon didn\u2019t attend a hearing at the Central District Court on Thursday, which was part of the review over his detention warrant, because of security concerns, according to Seok Dong-hyeon, one of the president\u2019s lawyers.\n\nHundreds of Yoon\u2019s supporters rallied for hours in streets near the court and the detention center where Yoon was being held, waving banners and chanting slogans calling for his release.\n\nA supporter of detained and impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol holds a placard that reads \"Arrest insurrectionist Lee Jae-myung\" during a rally at the entrance of the Seoul Detention Center in Seoul on January 16, 2025. YASUYOSHI CHIBA/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nYoon set off the country\u2019s most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s when he attempted to break through gridlock in legislation by declaring martial law and deploying troops around the National Assembly on December 3. The standoff lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.\n\nHis presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on December 14, accusing him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him.\n\nYoon and his allies have defied efforts to investigate his role in the chaos of December 3. He ignored requests to appear for questioning for weeks, remaining in his official residence to avoid detention as his lawyers turned away police, citing a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 Yoon himself. They also said that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.\n\nYoon also resisted one attempt to detain him as the presidential security service barricaded the residence. He was finally brought into custody after hundreds of anti-corruption investigators and police raided the presidential compound for around five hours in a second attempt.\n\nIn a video message recorded shortly before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented that the \u201crule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\u201d He echoed the arguments of his lawyers that the anti-corruption agency doesn\u2019t have the authority to investigate his actions, but said that he accepted detention to prevent violence.\n\nThe Constitutional Court rejected a request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to postpone a hearing on his case scheduled for Thursday. It remains possible for Yoon to exercise his right to attend, even while under detention.\n\nIf a court grants a warrant for Yoon\u2019s formal arrest, the anti-corruption investigators can extend his detention to 20 days, during which it will transfer the case to public prosecutors for an indictment.\n\nIf prosecutors indict Yoon on the possible charges of rebellion and abuse of power, he could remain under arrest until the first court ruling, which is typically made within six months, said Park Sung-bae, an attorney specializing in criminal law. Under South Korean law, the leader of a rebellion can face the death penalty or life imprisonment, if convicted.",

            "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Have you recreated a favorite vacation photo years later? Get in touch with CNN via the form below to share your story.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThree young women are photographed, mid-laughter, on a beach. It\u2019s a sunny day in the early 1980s. Their arms are wrapped around one another. They\u2019re snacking on potato chips, stretching out on a plaid picnic blanket after a dip in the English Channel.\n\n\u201cLooking at the photograph, it really epitomizes who we are as sisters,\u201d Pamela Cook tells CNN Travel today. \u201cUs three. Laughing like that. It\u2019s a photo I held onto for the longest time.\u201d\n\nCook spent years telling her two sisters, Tracey Waygood and Elaine McCartney, that they should recreate the picture, which was taken on Castle Beach in Cornwall, in the southwest of England, sometime around 1980.\n\nThe three sisters remain close and still visit Castle Beach together, spending long days together laughing, swimming and chatting.\n\nWaygood and McCartney always agreed that Cook was right, it would be fun, and it felt achievable \u2014 they knew exactly where the photo was taken, after all.\n\nThey just never quite got round to it, until last summer that is, when the three sisters finally gathered their supplies \u2014 bikinis, beach blanket and the prerequisite snack packet \u2014 to recreate the shot.\n\nThe three women, who are now in their late 60s and early 70s, figured that even though it was an overcast day, there was no time like the present.\n\nThis feeling was heightened by the fact McCartney was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago.\n\n\u201cWe know that time is precious, so we make the most of it,\u201d says Waygood. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we did it. It was really important to us.\u201d\n\nReturn to Castle Beach\n\nCastle Beach is in the coastal town of Falmouth. The three sisters grew up in the area and spent their summers on the beach, known for its rock pools, along with their gang of siblings.\n\n\u201cIt was always a big group of us,\u201d recalls Waygood. \u201cWe\u2019re a large family, and then there were always cousins and other friends, and there would always be a good crowd on the beach.\u201d\n\nThe family never went abroad on vacation.\n\n\u201cSix siblings. Mum and dad working class. That was our holiday,\u201d says Cook.\n\nBut Cook, Waygood and McCartney never fantasized about Spanish beaches. Never felt like they were missing out on trips to France. Not with Cornwall\u2019s incredible coastal beauty on their doorstep, and their large, loving family in tow.\n\n\u201cWe never looked for anything else,\u201d says Cook.\n\nToday, McCartney still lives about 15 minutes drive from Castle Beach, while Cook and Waygood live a couple hours away. Two other siblings live in Canada, but the family stay close via video calls and social media.\n\nWhen Cook, McCartney and Waygood mentioned their plans to recreate the 1980s beach photo, their loved ones didn\u2019t think too much about it. The trio often do something fun and \u201ca little crazy\u201d when they get together \u2014 every Christmas, for example, the sisters record themselves singing along to a favorite Christmas song and send the resulting chaos to their loved ones (\u201cNo wine is involved,\u201d jokes Tracey)\n\nOn their return trip to Castle Beach, the sisters prioritized a dip in the sea before taking the recreated photo. Pamela Cook\n\nUpon arriving at Castle Beach on the day of the recreated photo, the sisters prioritized having a dip in the sea first. They noted the overcast weather and wanted to make sure they enjoyed an icy, but invigorating plunge. It was cold, but it was great fun.\n\nBack on shore, the sisters went about setting up the recreated photo. Right away, they realized their accuracy was going to be slightly off, but they weren\u2019t discouraged.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get the memo about wearing the same color bikini,\u201d says Cook, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t have a blue bikini.\u201d\n\nAnd although the coastline has shifted over the years, the women were able to easily pinpoint the exact spot where their original picture was taken.\n\n\u201cThe beach cafe that used to be there got washed away in one of the storms, so it\u2019s been relocated and moved along slightly, but we wanted to sit in exactly the same place, because the railings were still there,\u201d says Waygood.\n\nThe sisters laid down their plaid beach blanket \u2014 not the same one from the 1980s, but another that Waygood found in her closet.\n\nNext step: finding a photographer. The sisters had assumed this would be easy, but glancing around the beach, there were no obvious contenders.\n\n\u201cBecause the weather was changing, and it had started to rain, and it was a little bit cool, there weren\u2019t actually a lot of people on the beach,\u201d recalls Waygood. \u201cSo I said to Pam, \u2018Why don\u2019t we ask somebody from the cafe?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the beach cafe featured in the 1980s shot is long gone, there\u2019s a present-day cafe on Castle Beach. The aptly named Castle Beach Cafe is a seasonal kiosk selling English seaside must-haves such as hot drinks, sausage rolls and chocolate brownies.\n\nCook lined up at the kiosk and, rather than placing an order for a hot chocolate, she asked the woman behind the counter if she\u2019d help them recreate an old photograph. Cook showed her the 1980s shot on her phone for reference.\n\nThe woman behind the counter, college student Jess Loydell, immediately jumped to attention, delighted at the prospect of helping with this photographic quest.\n\nHere's the recent recreation, taken by college student Jess Loydell, who works in Castle Beach Cafe. Loydell helped the sisters perfect their poses. Jess Loydell\n\nLoydell studied the original photo carefully, and then directed the women, making sure McCartney\u2019s arms were wrapped around her sisters in the same way, that the packet was being clutched just so.\n\nBut when it came to their smiles, the sisters didn\u2019t need much direction \u2014 capturing the joy of the original photo came naturally.\n\nThe goal, says Cook, had always been to \u201cmake it fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we were laughing about when the photo, the original photograph, was taken, but we were still laughing when the last one was taken,\u201d she says.\n\nCook, Waygood and McCartney were thrilled with the resulting shot. They thanked Loydell, who returned to the Castle Beach Cafe. The sisters spent a bit longer lying on the beach, reminiscing about good times together, making new memories.\n\nPositive reaction\n\nWhen they returned to their respective homes, the sisters shared the photograph on Facebook, much to the delight of their friends and family.\n\n\u201cOur siblings love it. Absolutely so proud sharing it,\u201d says Waygood. \u201cOur nephews and nieces in Canada were sharing it, \u2018These are, these are our crazy aunties in England.\u2019\u201d\n\nStaff at Castle Beach Cafe reached out and asked if they could post the shot to their own social media pages. The sisters happily agreed. Then suddenly, it wasn\u2019t just family and friends weighing in, as the recreated photo spread across the internet and was picked up by local news outlets.\n\nThe sisters were inundated with positive feedback, with many people suggesting they\u2019d been inspired to recreate a favorite photo. Others tagged their sisters, posting heart emojis.\n\n\u201cThe comments have been just inspiring for us,\u201d says Cook.\n\nAnd while interspersed among the positivity were the inevitable naysayers, Cook, Waygood and McCartney shrugged off any negativity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just social media,\u201d says Cook. \u201cBut we are so comfortable in our skins. We just didn\u2019t worry about us going on the beach at our ages in our bikinis.\u201d\n\nCelebrating sisterhood\n\nThe sisters love seeing the pictures side by side and seeing their joy in both photos. Jess Loydell\n\nWaygood, Cook and McCartney never took the photograph in a quest for fame or in the hope that people across the world might see it on their newsfeeds and hit like (\u201cI didn\u2019t even brush my hair,\u201d says Waygood, laughing).\n\nThe trio say they did it for themselves, to celebrate their sisterhood, their enduring relationship, the joy of a day together on the beach.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint what exactly makes them have such a close sisterly relationship, says Waygood and Cook.\n\nIt feels \u201csuch a natural thing,\u201d as Cook puts it, to have a relationship defined by \u201ca lot of fun, a lot of laughs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not until another person says, \u2018You\u2019re so lucky to have your closeness and have each other,\u2019\u201d says Waygood.\n\nStill, in recent years, McCartney\u2019s dementia has made the sisters appreciate their bond in a new light. Their relationship is still defined by levity and joy. But they\u2019re more aware that nothing is forever.\n\nAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons they\u2019re so happy to have the two photos. So that the feeling of joy remains, no matter what happens in the future.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to capture that moment,\u201d says Cook.\n\n\u201cCapture that moment. For us,\u201d adds Waygood. \u201cAnd we did it, and it\u2019s wonderful. We\u2019ve got us. We\u2019ve got the three of us on the beach smiling.\u201d\n\nIf others enjoy seeing the two pictures, or get inspired, that\u2019s just an unexpected, heartwarming bonus for the sisters.\n\nWaygood\u2019s advice for anyone hoping to follow in their footsteps and recreate a favorite photo is \u201cdon\u2019t wait for perfection, just get out and do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow might not be there,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for Cook, she now has the two shots framed in her home. They always make her smile.\n\n\u201cWhat I loved about it when I saw the two photographs, was that even though it wasn\u2019t accurate, it wasn\u2019t perfect \u2014 I\u2019d captured what I wanted to capture, and that was the three of us being who we are,\u201d says Cook.",

            "title": "As US \u2018TikTok refugees\u2019 move to RedNote, some are encountering Chinese-style censorship for the first time",
            "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nChinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, has been hiring for a surprising position in recent days: English-language content moderators.\n\nThat\u2019s because a growing number of US users are creating new accounts there, driven in large part by a looming ban on TikTok, which is due to take effect Sunday.\n\nThe sudden influx of overseas users, many of whom call themselves \u201cTikTok refugees,\u201d is posing a new challenge for the app, which must now strike a balance between satisfying China\u2019s stringent content moderation rules while also providing a positive experience for its non-Chinese-speaking newbies.\n\nMany are having a good time. Heather Roberts, an American artist with more than 32,000 followers on TikTok and a new account on RedNote, said she enjoyed using the Chinese app because \u201ceveryone is being so nice, so kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that the Chinese people are not so different from us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThis is really bringing us together. It\u2019s a beautiful thing \u2013 it really is.\u201d\n\nBut for an increasing number of American users, the honeymoon has been short-lived.\n\nJust days into using RedNote, some have started to express frustration over the censorship rules, which go far beyond what they\u2019re used to. It\u2019s not just violent content, hate speech or pornography that is off-limits. China\u2019s internet is famous for censoring an ever-growing list of terms deemed sensitive, either politically or otherwise.\n\nAnd while Chinese authorities set the censorship rules, their enforcement is generally left to the platforms, which often employ sizeable teams of moderators to remove content that violates the guidelines. These platforms are compelled to enforce the censorship rigorously, as non-compliance could lead to fines, suspensions, or even shutdowns.\n\nLeaving the platform\n\nOne American user, who identified themselves as \u201cnon-binary\u201d on RedNote, was censored after publishing a post on Tuesday asking if the platform welcomed gay people. The post was removed within hours, the user told CNN.\n\nThe next day, they uploaded a new post saying they will quit the platform over the decision but was soon on the receiving end of homophobic comments, with some users accusing them of cultural imposition.\n\nOne American user on RedNote, who identified themselves as 'non-binary,' was censored after publishing a post on Tuesday asking if the platform welcomed gay people. CNN\n\nIn a separate post, a male user expressed frustration after RedNote censored a photo of his upper body. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I post photos of my fitness and abs?\u201d he asked, adding he had \u201cnever had such a problem on TikTok and Instagram.\u201d\n\nA Chinese user suggested that he try covering his nipples, as Chinese social media platforms generally impose restrictions on displaying them when it is perceived as sexually suggestive.\n\nA few RedNote users also noted that posts about the Japanese anime My Hero Academia, which faced censorship in China since 2018 due to controversial references to Japan\u2019s wartime history, have since been removed from the platform.\n\nWhen asked if China would step up the review of content uploaded by overseas users, a spokesperson for Beijing\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called social media use \u201ca personal choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina has always supported and encouraged strengthening people-to-people and cultural exchanges with other countries to promote people-to-people connections,\u201d Guo Jiakun told a daily press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\nA commentary published by China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily said the influx of overseas users was indicative of Beijing\u2019s growing soft power. \u201cWithout doubt, this was due to China\u2019s profound historical and cultural accumulation \u2026 the openness of the country, the friendliness of the people, and the tolerance of our society,\u201d the newspaper wrote on Thursday.\n\nUrgent need\n\nThe influx of users unfamiliar with China\u2019s internet rules has sent RedNote scrambling to hire English-speaking content moderators familiar with Western culture.\n\nSince the beginning of this week, RedNote has surged to the top position on Apple\u2019s US App Store. While it is one of China\u2019s biggest social media platforms with 300 million users, it hasn\u2019t gained much prominence beyond the Chinese-speaking world until now.\n\nThe company has been \u201cscrambling to find ways to moderate English-language content and build English-Chinese translation tools,\u201d Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the company.\n\nAccording to Yangcheng Evening News, a state-run newspaper, RedNote has posted \u201curgent\u201d job advertisements for moderators focused on managing posts in English. One such post, which first appeared on a Chinese recruitment platform, had since been removed by Thursday. It is unclear why it was deleted, and CNN has reached out to RedNote for comment.\n\nAnother post, which still appears on RedNote\u2019s official website as of Thursday, shows that the company is looking for new \u201cinnovation operation interns\u201d who will help with \u201cpromoting the healthy development of the content community ecosystem\u201d in English.\n\nSome Chinese RedNote users have also posted reminders for their American counterparts on navigating the censorship system. For example, some have openly called on the newbies to accept China\u2019s sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to take control of it, by force if necessary, despite having never controlled it. Taipei strongly opposes that claim, and says the island\u2019s future can only be decided by its people.\n\nIvy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, said while the influx of new American users could pose challenges for content moderators on the app and the Chinese government, it is still considered \u201ca big win\u201d for China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a self-selective cohort of curious users who are open to learning about the other side of the digital firewall, and they are leaning into the possibility of (being) proven wrong about China and its people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf China is serious about the people-to-people exchange, then perhaps there is a possibility for this kind of organic engagement to blossom for a while longer.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been the case for Jeremy Fraga, a father of three from Fort Worth, Texas, who said he has been addicted to RedNote since downloading it on Monday, and has introduced the platform to his children.\n\n\u201cGetting on RedNote and talking to these people one-on-one for hours, it\u2019s just shown me a different side of China. And it\u2019s challenged my worldview,\u201d Fraga said. \u201cI do believe that I\u2019m going to make that my new home, even if TikTok doesn\u2019t get banned.\u201d",

            "title": "Extraordinary ocean stories: From the sex lives of pygmy seahorses to parasites living in fish nostrils",
            "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nPygmy seahorses, about the size of a fingernail, are some of the smallest vertebrates in the world. First discovered in 1969, little was known about the creatures. But in the early 2000s, British marine biologist Richard Smith decided to focus his PhD research on Denise\u2019s pygmy seahorse, a species found in Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was then that he made an extraordinary discovery.\n\nSeahorses are renowned for mating for life, with the male carrying the eggs. But after following three male pygmies and one female for weeks, Smith discovered that the sex lives of the smaller variety can be much more colorful.\n\nAfter flirting with one male, the female would impregnate him, before he went off to brood the eggs for 12 days. Around six days later, another male would come along and she would impregnate him too. The third male, who never got the chance to mate with the female, took to attacking his more successful rivals, attempting to strangle them with his tail.\n\nThis story and others are collated in Smith\u2019s book \u201cThe World Beneath: The Life and Times of Unknown Sea Creatures and Coral Reefs,\u201d published in November in the US and January in the UK. It showcases the ocean\u2019s little-known creatures with more than 300 images taken during Smith\u2019s research dives in over 23 countries.\n\nRichard Smith has taken photographs of underwater life all over the world, including this vibrant coral reef in Raja Ampat, West Papua, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nThere are photographs of flasher wrasses, which Smith calls the \u201cpeacocks of the sea\u201d for seducing the females with their kaleidoscope of color. There is the Banggai cardinal fish, found only in Indonesia, which keeps its eggs and newly hatched babies in its mouth for two weeks. Then, there are gruesome parasites, his latest obsession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked weird and wonderful creatures, whether it\u2019s on land or underwater,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut underwater, so little is known about so much.\u201d\n\nPatience is key\n\nSurprisingly, photography came as something of an afterthought to Smith. He started capturing images purely to aid scientific identification and to demonstrate the scale of some of the tiny species he was studying. Gradually, he realized the power of communicating species\u2019 behavior through images and raising awareness of the increasing threats marine fauna face.\n\n\u201cI started to realize that if I wanted to communicate the stories of animals in danger, a beautiful image makes a huge difference,\u201d he says.\n\nDuring his PhD, after locating the group of four pygmies living in gorgonian (sea fan) corals in Sulawesi, Smith would spend four or five hours a day diving and observing their reproductive and social behavior. \u201cI would study them from dawn until dusk,\u201d he says fondly, and he gave them names: Josephine was the heroine, and her male suitors were called Tom, Dick and Harry.\n\nA heavily pregnant male Denise's pygmy seahorse is photographed on his way to give birth, in Wakatobi, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\n\u201cI think anthropomorphism has a really useful role in people relating to animals and their behaviors. The pygmy seahorse is so tiny, yet it has this elaborate social behavior,\u201d he says.\n\nSmith photographed them using a digital SLR camera with a macro lens inside waterproof housing. \u201cYou have to have a lot of patience,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m keen not to disturb the animals for photos, so I would never poke it or move it to a better background or anything. I just wait and watch.\u201d\n\nHe was the first to document an example of polygamy in the seahorse family, and the imagery showed the process in minute detail, even capturing the stretch marks around the belly of the male pygmy once it had released its offspring.\n\nMore recently, the object of his fascination has turned to parasites. It\u2019s the stuff of horror films: Smith recalls one that lives in the nostril of a crocodile fish. Another attacks the anemonefish (also known as the clownfish, featured in the animated movie \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d), climbing through its gill arch as a tiny larva and then settling in the mouth, eating away its tongue, and staring out ominously with two black specks for eyes.\n\nAn anemonefish with a tongue-biter isopod parasite peering out of its mouth, in Lembeh Strait, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nThen there\u2019s a parasitoid worm that Smith photographed curled inside a shrimp, like spaghetti: \u201cIt starts off infecting the shrimp and then it grows, eating the least important organs to start with, until it eventually becomes a zombie shrimp that just feeds and fuels the growth of the parasite,\u201d he explains. \u201cUltimately, the parasite will explode out and infect others and kill the host, making it a parasitoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cA beacon of positivity\u201d\n\nSmith is intent on uncovering behaviors never seen before, whether brutal or awe-inspiring. He believes that gathering new information on these little-known species can help build an understanding of ocean ecosystems and ultimately aid their conservation.\n\nHe is the focal lead for pygmy seahorses for the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world\u2019s most comprehensive information source on the extinction risk status of plant and animal species. Recently, he led the assessment of the Walea soft coral pygmy seahorse, which was listed as the first critically endangered seahorse.\n\nWalea pygmies, along with many other marine species, are threatened by destructive fishing practices and temperature extremes caused by climate change. Coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent and widespread, causing whole ecosystems to collapse.\n\nWalea Soft Coral Pygmy Seahorse (Hippocampus waleananus) Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nSmith hopes that his book will \u201cinspire and educate people about coral reefs.\u201d But while he communicates the threats, his main aim is to shine a light on the incredible animals that are out there.\n\n\u201cWe hear so much doom and gloom about the environment, and while I think it\u2019s important to realize this is happening, the best starting point is to teach people what is there \u2026 The more people know about these animals and the ecosystem, the more they want to protect it,\u201d he says.\n\nSmith wants to take readers on a journey of discovery and exploration. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s still to be discovered, we keep finding new things,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s a beacon of positivity. There are things out there to save and we can still do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nA senior official with the United Nations\u2019 Palestinian refugee agency on Friday outlined the scale of the task facing aid workers as they prepare to ramp up their response in Gaza following the agreement of a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nMore than 15 months of Israeli bombardment has laid waste to the Palestinian enclave, displacing more than 2 million people \u2013 often multiple times \u2013 and triggered a humanitarian disaster marked by hunger, disease and a lack of medical care.\n\n\u201cMany of our warehouses have been inaccessible for several months, but we\u2019re working to prepare to get them ready. We have the distribution networks. We have the staff on the ground,\u201d said Sam Rose, UNRWA\u2019s acting director of affairs in Gaza.\n\nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s John Vause from Nuseirat, central Gaza, Rose said the entry of aid to the strip had been \u201csystematically hindered and constrained,\u201d with the situation compounded by a breakdown in law and order and destroyed roads.\n\nWith a ceasefire expected to take effect in the coming days, pending an Israeli government vote to approve the deal, Rose said aid agencies expect hundreds of thousands of people will be on the move back to Gaza City, making logistics and congestion a concern.\n\nUnexploded ordnance hidden under debris is also a major risk for children and civilians, Rose said.\n\nFlow of aid: Some 4,000 aid trucks have been stuck at a border crossing point for months, with two-thirds of all food aid waiting outside the enclave from UNRWA, Rose said.\n\nRose stressed that the flow of aid must increase from the first day of the ceasefire, which can only happen if trucks are able to come and go safely from cross border points.\n\n\u201cThe supplies of aid have been so paltry over the past several months that, in a way, any increase will be a success,\u201d he said, though he added that aid is only one factor in the humanitarian response.",

            "text": "Relive SpaceX Starship\u2019s seventh test flight as it happened and follow updates on its aftermath.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nSpaceX\u2019s colossal Starship launch system lifted off on its seventh uncrewed test flight Thursday, with an upgraded version of the megarocket embarking on the program\u2019s most ambitious flight to date.\n\nSpaceX was able to duplicate its prior feat of catching a booster that returned to Earth. But 8.5 minutes into flight, the Starship spacecraft itself was lost.\n\n\u201cStarship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn,\u201d the company shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cTeams will continue to review data from today\u2019s flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s flight will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability.\u201d\n\nA \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or \u201cRUD,\u201d is a phrase SpaceX typically uses to refer to an explosion. Starship had already climbed 90 miles (146 kilometers) in altitude and was traveling at 13,200 miles per hour (21,317 kilometers per hour), according to the last telemetry data shared by SpaceX.\n\nDebris can be seen streaking over Turks and Caicos after the SpaceX Starship vehicle exploded. Brian Henry\n\nAircraft-tracking website Flightradar24 shared on X that the Starship explosion caused its most tracked flights to be \u201call aircraft holding or diverting to avoid any potential debris.\u201d Meanwhile, posts are appearing on social media showing purported debris from the spacecraft falling over the Caribbean.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said flights departing Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport were being delayed for an average of one hour due to a \u201crocket launch anomaly.\u201d A separate FAA alert said flights were delayed due to \u201cdebris.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,\u201d according to a statement from the agency.\n\nAt 5:55 p.m. ET, 18 minutes after Starship\u2019s launch, a pilot radioed to an air traffic controller at a San Juan air traffic control facility. \u201cWe just got a major streak, going from at least 60 miles, there\u2019s all these different colors, just curious. It looked like it was coming towards us, but obviously because of this, just letting you know,\u201d the pilot said.\n\nMeanhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk shared an image of debris in a post and appeared to make light of the situation, saying \u201centertainment is guaranteed!\u201d\n\nSpaceX's megarocket lifts off on its seventh test flight from the Starbase launch site near Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday. SpaceX\n\nThe Starship spacecraft, stacked atop the Super Heavy rocket booster, took flight at 5:37 p.m. ET (4:37 p.m. local time) Thursday. The rocket booster revved up the 33 engines at its base, sending a loud roar across Starbase, the SpaceX launch site near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nFor the first time, one of those 33 Raptor engines had been to space before: SpaceX said it was reusing an engine recovered from the Super Heavy booster flown during the company\u2019s fifth test flight in October.\n\nAs the Super Heavy rocket booster \u2014 the bottommost section, or first stage, of the Starship system \u2014 burned through most of its fuel, SpaceX guided the Super Heavy back to a pinpoint landing at the launch site after it separated from the Starship spacecraft.\n\nThe Starship spacecraft ignited its own engines and began soaring through space.\n\nThe company steered the Super Heavy booster squarely into the \u201cchopsticks,\u201d the metal arms of \u201cMechazilla,\u201d which is SpaceX\u2019s name for the launch tower that also serves as a structural mechanism for catching rocket parts as they blaze back down from the sky after launch.\n\nSpaceX had only successfully recaptured a Super Heavy booster after launch once before, during the fifth fully integrated Starship test flight in October 2024.\n\nThe maneuver sent an earsplitting sonic boom ringing across the landing site, which is in close proximity to the popular Texas tourist destination of South Padre Island.\n\nPath for \u2018new generation\u2019 Starship\n\nWhile the Super Heavy aced its landing attempt, the Starship spacecraft, or upper stage, was expected to continue propelling itself through space, reaching speeds almost fast enough to enter orbit around Earth.\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is successfully caught by the arms of the launch tower at the Starbase launchpad. SpaceX\n\nBut the Starship spacecraft stopped delivering telemetry, suggesting that the spacecraft may have been lost.\n\n\u201cWe were expecting ship engine cutoff about 40 seconds ago,\u201d said SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot on the live stream during a crucial part of the ascent phase. \u201cWe saw some of those engines start to go out prior to that point. And so right now we are, we are just standing by to try and get the latest word on where we are.\u201d\n\nShortly after the update, the team confirmed the loss of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that we did lose the ship,\u201d SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said.\n\nPrior to the completion of Starship\u2019s ascent burn to space, a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to an explosion and sending debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas, according to SpaceX.\n\n\u201cStarship flew within its designated launch corridor \u2014 as all U.S. launches do to safeguard the public both on the ground, on water and in the air,\u201d the company shared on its site. \u201cAny surviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area. If you believe you have identified a piece of debris, please do not attempt to handle or retrieve the debris directly. Instead, please contact your local authorities or the SpaceX Debris Hotline at 1-866-623-0234 or at recovery@spacex.com.\u201d\n\nMusk took to X, which he owns, to share that \u201cimproved versions of the ship (and) booster already waiting for launch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\u201d Musk added later. \u201cApart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area. Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared his thoughts on X. \u201cCongrats to @SpaceX on Starship\u2019s seventh test flight and the second successful booster catch. Spaceflight is not easy. It\u2019s anything but routine. That\u2019s why these tests are so important \u2014 each one bringing us closer on our path to the Moon and onward to Mars through #Artemis.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cnew generation\u201d Starship flying on the Thursday mission had some substantial upgrades from previous versions, according to SpaceX. The changes included additional fuel capacity, which could allow Starship\u2019s engines to burn longer and generate more speed.\n\nThe vehicle was also equipped with a more powerful flight computer, revamped navigation, and new antennas that SpaceX hoped would allow Starship to better communicate with the company\u2019s space-based internet network, Starlink.\n\nCrucially, SpaceX was also for the first time attempting to test out how the Starship vehicle might deploy satellites. On board the spacecraft were 10 dummy payloads that are roughly the same size and weight as SpaceX\u2019s next generation of Starlink satellites.\n\nAbout 17 minutes into the mission, SpaceX was intended to deploy the mock satellites as part of a demonstration. Like Starship, the demo payloads were not expected to reach orbit. Rather, they would have been on a suborbital trajectory similar to that of Starship, guaranteeing they would be discarded in the ocean, according the company.\n\nAbout one hour after takeoff, the Starship spacecraft was expected to make a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The maneuver was intended to test out how Starship might be recovered after future flights. But as has been the case with the past few test missions, the vehicle would have been discarded and left to a watery grave.\n\nSpaceX will go back and assess the data from the flight to determine what caused the spacecraft to fail, Huot said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time. In the next hours, days \u2014 we\u2019re going to figure out exactly what happened, come back, fly the next one, get farther,\u201d he said. \u201cReminder, it\u2019s a test of an experimental vehicle.\u201d\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

            "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN \u2014\n\nWe are all vulnerable to the rapid spread of phone scams \u2013 including, it seems, world leaders. Thailand\u2019s prime minister has revealed she got a call from an AI system, demanding money in the voice of another famous head of government.\n\nPaetongtarn Shinawatra did not reveal who the computer was mimicking, but said she received a message in a voice identical to a well-known leader.\n\n\u201cThe voice was very clear, and I recognized it immediately. They first sent a voice clip, saying something like, \u2018How are you? I want to work together,\u2019 and so on,\u201d Paetongtarn said.\n\nShe said she later missed a call from the same number, then received a voice message which cut to the chase: \u201cThey sent another voice message asking for a donation, saying, \u2018You are the only country in (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) that hasn\u2019t donated yet,\u2019 emphasizing it. I was taken aback for a moment and realized something was off.\u201d\n\nShe said whoever sent the message \u201cprobably used AI to take the voice\u201d of the unnamed world leader.\n\nScams or scam centers are not uncommon in Southeast Asia. In recent years, investigators say transnational crime organizations have exploited technological advances and the civil war in Myanmar to build a billion-dollar industry scamming people across the world.\n\nIn January, a Chinese actor flew to Bangkok for what he thought was a casting call for a movie. Instead, he was picked up at the airport and driven to a scam center in Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy, a notorious cyber-fraud hub across the border from Thailand.\n\nThis is also a problem for thousands of ordinary people who are lured to Thailand with the promise of white-collar jobs, before ultimately being trafficked to criminal hubs in Myanmar where they are held against their will and forced to steal millions in cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile many of the scams currently use phone calls and traditional messaging, there have been warnings that, as AI technology advances in leaps and bounds, millions of people could fall victim to scams using artificial intelligence to clone their voices.\n\nLast year, OpenAI, the maker of generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, unveiled its voice replication tool, Voice Engine, but didn\u2019t make it available to the public at that stage, citing the \u201cpotential for synthetic voice misuse.\u201d\n\nPaetongtarn, who began her political career in 2021 as the chief of the Pheu Thai\u2019s party Inclusion and Innovation Advisory Committee, became prime minister in August 2024.\n\nShe is the third member in her family\u2019s political dynasty to serve as prime minister following her father and aunt, who served for five and three years respectively.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDavid Lynch, an influential director known for his unique and surrealistic films and TV shows including \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d has died. He was 78.\n\nHis death was confirmed via his official Facebook page, where his family wrote:\n\n\u201cIt is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There\u2019s a big hole in the world now that he\u2019s no longer with us. But, as he would say, \u2018Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to Lynch\u2019s foundation for further comment. A cause of death has not been disclosed.\n\nLynch\u2019s almost-50-year cinematic career was distinguished by a series of distinctive, highly stylized films that often feature surreal situations, fragmented timelines, and supernatural elements. He was awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and an honorary Oscar in 2019 for \u201ca lifetime of artistic accomplishment.\u201d He was also a four-time Oscar nominee in competitive categories, including three times for best director for 1980\u2019s \u201cElephant Man,\u201d 1986\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive\u201d from 2001.\n\nIn 2024, Lynch announced that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after many years of smoking, and that he was largely \u201chousebound\u201d due to the risks of contracting Covid-19. After sharing the news, Lynch assured his supporters that he planned to keep working, writing that despite his diagnosis, \u201cI am filled with happiness, and I will never retire.\u201d\n\nBeginnings\n\nBorn in Missoula, Montana, in 1946, Lynch spent his childhood moving to different parts of the US due to his father\u2019s job as a research scientist for the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nAlthough he achieved fame as a filmmaker, Lynch started his career as a painter and visual artist, studying at Washington, D.C.\u2019s Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and finally at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nIt was in Philadelphia that in addition to starting a family, Lynch first started experimenting with filmmaking, inspired by the idea of making his paintings move.\n\n\u201cI was painting, and the painting, as I said before, I was painting very dark paintings. And I saw some little part of this figure moving, and I hear a wind,\u201d he said in a 1997 interview. \u201cAnd I really wanted these things to move and have a sound with them. And so I started making an animated film as a moving painting. And that was it.\u201d\n\nLynch\u2019s early experiments with the medium reflect his penchant for strange subject matter and creative visuals: his first short, \u201cSix Men Getting Sick (Six Times),\u201d is an experimental animation, featuring figures vomiting in sequence.\n\nIn 1970, he moved with his family to Los Angeles, where he enrolled in the American Film Institute Conservatory and started work on his first feature film: the cult classic \u201cEraserhead,\u201d a kind of body horror meets parenthood drama flick. The black-and-white film, was released in 1977 and has screened for years as a midnight feature.\n\nLynch followed up \u201cEraserhead\u201d with the commercial hit \u201cThe Elephant Man,\u201d starring John Hurt as Joseph Merrick, and \u201cDune,\u201d a widely panned adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s science fiction novel.\n\nHis next feature film, \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d features many of the themes that recur throughout his work: a dreamlike plot involving sex and violence, a suburban setting that belies the seedy underworld beneath, and performances by frequent Lynch collaborators Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern.\n\nIn 1990, Lynch debuted both \u201cWild at Heart\u201d \u2013 a romantic crime film starring Dern and Nicolas Cage that took home the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival \u2013 and \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d one of the most impactful works of his career. The cult classic TV show features MacLachlan as a courteous but eccentric FBI agent investigating the mysterious murder of the homecoming queen in the quaint fictional town of Twin Peaks. The show\u2019s first season received 14 Emmy nominations. Although it was cancelled after just two seasons, the series has been cited as one of the most influential TV shows of all time.\n\nMacLachlan remembered Lynch as an \u201cenigmatic and intuitive man with a creative ocean bursting forth inside of him,\u201d and credited Lynch for helping him build the career he has today.\n\n\u201cHis love for me and mine for him came out of the cosmic fate of two people who saw the best things about themselves in each other,\u201d MacLachlan wrote on his Instagram page Thursday. \u201cI will miss him more than the limits of my language can tell and my heart can bear. My world is that much fuller because I knew him and that much emptier now that he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nDirector David Lynch poses for a portrait in his private screening room in Los Angeles in 2010.

His last feature film, 2006\u2019s \u201cInland Empire,\u201d is a psychological thriller starring Dern, Jeremy Irons and Justin Theroux. In the interim, he has helmed several shorts and music videos, including for Interpol and Nine Inch Nails.\n\nIn 2017, Lynch debuted the long-awaited third season of Twin Peaks, \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return,\u201d set 25 years after the original series.\n\nAnd although he is best known as a filmmaker, Lynch continued the painting practice that started his career as an artist and dabbled in music, releasing a rock album called \u201cBlueBob\u201d in 2001, an EP called \u201cThis Train\u201d in 2011, and a \u201cmodern blues\u201d album called \u201cThe Big Dream\u201d in 2013.\n\n\u201cI only wanted to ever be a painter, but painting led into filmmaking,\u201d he said of his career in a 2019 interview with the New York Times. \u201cI always say, I go where the ideas take me.\u201d\n\nAnother through-line that defined Lynch was his commitment to transcendental meditation, which according to the website for The David Lynch Foundation is a \u201ctechnique practiced 20 minutes twice a day while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed.\u201d In a statement on his site, the filmmaker wrote that he started the practice in 1973 and had \u201cnot missed a single meditation ever since. Twice a day, every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has given me effortless access to unlimited reserves of energy, creativity and happiness deep within,\u201d he added. \u201cThis level of life is sometimes called \u2018pure consciousness\u2019\u2014it is a treasury. And this level of life is deep within us all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Vulture in 2018, the director said that despite their sometimes-morbid subject matter, the source of his films was ultimately joy.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, if you get an idea that you love and you want to realize it, then the trip of realizing it should be joyful and the result should be joyful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHappiness is not a new car; it\u2019s the doing of the work. If you like the doing, the result will be a joy.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

Bianca de Marchi/AAPIMAGE/Reuters\n\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke joined the chorus of condemnation from government ministers, calling the attack a \u201chate crime\u201d that comes with \u201cserious criminal penalties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have our best agencies working to make sure that these people are hunted down \u2026 Nobody should think that anything that is happening anywhere around the world gives them the right to conduct a hate crime in Australia,\u201d Burke said.\n\nFriday\u2019s attack comes just days after red swastikas were daubed on two synagogues in the Sydney suburbs of Allawah and Newtown.\n\nTwo suspects dressed in black were caught on closed-circuit video cameras outside Newtown Synagogue, according to police in the state of New South Wales (NSW), of which Sydney is the capital.\n\nImages released by police show two figures apparently leaving the scene on a pushbike and electric scooter. Police allege they also tried to light a fire.\n\nPolice released CCTV images after offensive graffiti was sprayed on a synagogue in Sydney\u2019s Inner West on Saturday, January 11, during which police believe an arson attempt was also made. NSW Police\n\n\u201cWe will lock you up\u201d\n\nA spate of antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne prompted the government to assign a special taskforce to address the problem.\n\nOperation Avalite filed its first charges Thursday, against a 44-year-old man who allegedly made death threats via social media directed at the Australian Jewish Association.\n\nThe Avalite team of 20 officers and analysts, including counter-terrorism investigators, are investigating dozens of antisemitic attacks dating back to October 2023.\n\nThey include an arson attack on Melbourne\u2019s Adass Israel synagogue, which was gutted by fire in early December \u2013 and led to a security upgrade outside Jewish schools, community centers and places of worship.\n\n\u201cNo Australian should have to go to bed filled with apprehension about hate crimes being perpetrated overnight, said David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies Friday.\n\nThe destroyed interior of the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne.

            "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nChina\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the last three months of 2024, official data showed on Friday, as it awaits the likely imposition of fresh tariffs by US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next week.\n\nMuch of the growth momentum came from exports, which propelled the country\u2019s trade surplus to a record high of just under $1 trillion last year. That strength, though, is likely to draw the ire of Trump, who has said China will face higher tariffs on its goods, by 10% above any existing tariffs, until it prevents the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. On the campaign trial, he had threatened upwards of 60% on all Chinese imports to the US.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) separately revealed that China, which is struggling with demographic and economic problems, also notched a surprise increase in the birth rate last year, reversing a trend of declines that intensified from 2017. But the overall population continued to decline for a third year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 5.4%. That\u2019s considerably stronger than the 5.0% forecast by a group of economists polled by Reuters and represents an acceleration from the 4.6% pace posted in the third quarter.\n\nAs for the full year, growth came in at 5.0%, a shade higher than the 4.9% predicted by the Reuters poll. Goldman Sachs analysts said the quarterly growth data and last month\u2019s industrial production numbers beat expectations \u201cmeaningfully,\u201d but weaknesses remain.\n\nThey anticipate that growth will slow to 4.5% this year \u201cas the growth drag from likely higher US tariffs may more than offset the ongoing policy easing amid the prolonged property downturn and still-weak consumer sentiment,\u201d they wrote in a research note.\n\nEconomic momentum did pick up in the last few months of 2024, after the Chinese leadership finally decided to go ahead with a much-needed stimulus package, mostly focused on monetary measures, in the last week of September.\n\nSince then, policymakers have made a series of other moves \u2014 including a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) debt package to help local governments, interest rate cuts and the expansion of a \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d scheme for household goods such as rice cookers \u2014 to boost growth.\n\nMany experts believe much more needs to be done to light a fire under the country\u2019s vast population of consumers, who have been sitting on the sidelines after suffering a massive loss of wealth from the continuing housing slump, which amounted to an estimated $18 trillion, according to investment bank Barclays.\n\nIn fact, some believe the imminent return of Trump and his possible sky-high tariffs may be just what is needed to jolt the Chinese leadership into taking more action.\n\nBeijing has shown that \u201cthey will do whatever it takes to offset the impact of tariffs,\u201d Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said in a Wednesday research note. \u201cStrong tariffs result in strong stimulus and thus better domestic demand.\u201d\n\nBirth rate increases\n\nChina is contending with a slew of pressures, including a severe property crisis, which has eroded consumer wealth and hurt household spending, and a demographic challenge, expected to have significant implications on future growth.\n\nLast year, the country recorded 6.77 births per 1,000 people, up from 6.39 a year earlier, according to the NBS. Some 9.54 million babies were born, an increase of more than half a million from 2023.\n\nThis is the first time China has recorded an increase in newborns since 2016, when the country saw a brief uptick in births following the relaxation of its decades-long one child policy.\n\nThe small rebound comes after the government has rolled out a raft of measures to nudge young people to have more children, from extending maternity leaves and offering financial incentives to improving childcare services. 2024 was also the Year of the Dragon on the Chinese lunar calendar, an especially auspicious year for having babies.\n\nBut the overall population has fell by 1.39 million to 1.408 billion in 2024, continuing a decline since 2022 that saw China replaced by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nChina\u2019s working population, classified as those between the ages of 16 and 59, also declined by 6.83 million last year, adding to an ongoing contraction. The population of those over 60, meanwhile, continued to expand to account for 22% of the total population.\n\nThe rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce pose a severe challenge to China\u2019s economic and social stability, as it grapples with funding health care and pensions for elderly citizens while aiming to maintain growth.\n\nIn 2015, China announced an end to its decades-long one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children, then increased that to three children in 2021. But birth rates have continued to drop after a brief uptick.\n\nThe government has also vowed to promote a \u201cnew-era marriage and childbearing culture\u201d by encouraging young people to get married and give birth at an \u201cappropriate age\u201d and share responsibility for childcare.\n\nSo far, these policies have largely failed to convince young adults, who are grappling with high unemployment, rising living costs and a lack of social welfare support amid the economic slowdown. Many are postponing marriage and childbirth, and a growing number of young people even choose to eschew them entirely.",

And much was done to preserve the household\u2019s tranquility, given its immediate neighbor: the largest and most notorious Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz.\n\nInside the family home, Rudolf H\u00f6ss \u2013 the longest serving SS commandant of Auschwitz \u2013 dreamt up the most efficient way to kill the millions of Jews, Roma, homosexuals and political prisoners that the Third Reich had decided to eliminate.\n\nTall trees and a high concrete wall obscured the view and the screams of the camp so that Rudolf\u2019s wife Hedwig and their five children \u2013 Klaus, Heidetraud, Brigitte, Hans-J\u00fcrgen and Annegret \u2013 could live shielded from the atrocities committed just feet from their door.\n\nTheirs was a joyful life. The children played with turtles, cats, rode horses and swam in the nearby river. Meanwhile, the concentration camp\u2019s chimneys spewed smoke as other families were pushed into the gas chambers.\n\nThe former H\u00f6ss residence lies just feet away from the Auschwitz concentration camp. CNN\n\nMembers of the H\u00f6ss family spend time in the manicured garden at 88 Legionow Street. Institut f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte\n\nSince Auschwitz was liberated in January 1945, the house at 88 Legionow Street had been in the private hands of a Polish family. But last year it was acquired by the Counter Extremism Project, a New York-based NGO that has sought to combat extremism since 2014.\n\nWithin days, this building \u2013 a potent symbol of how the Holocaust was orchestrated and a major character in the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d \u2013 will open its door to visitors in a brand-new form.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind the project is to create something that doesn\u2019t exist, a global center to fight extremism in the house of one of the historically worst extremists and anti-semites that ever existed,\u201d Hans Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, told CNN.\n\nThe NGO\u2019s plans for the house are twofold: to give a new center to their organization and to open this long closed-off house to the public in time for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the camp on January 27.\n\nWhile the family enjoyed an idyllic life, the horrors of Auschwitz lay just over the wall. Adam Trzcionka/CEP\n\nThe house and its unique location formed a fundamental part of the Oscar-winning movie \"The Zone of Interest,\" seen here in a still image. Courtesy of A24\n\n\u201cWhen you look at this property, the gardens, the fountains, the normal, ordinary life, we\u2019ve been taught since the time of the Holocaust to never forget,\u201d said Mark Wallace, CEO of the Counter Extremism Project. \u201cEighty years later it\u2019s clear that while essential, \u201cnever forgetting\u201d is not enough to prevent the hate and antisemitism that right now grips our society.\u201d\n\nNow, it isn\u2019t just pictures of the H\u00f6ss\u2019s blissful domesticity that remain, but also diaries, one written by the family\u2019s housekeeper and the other by Rudolf H\u00f6ss himself. This was not out of choice: After his capture and before his execution, H\u00f6ss was ordered to write his memoir, giving an insight into the workings of a mind that was both ordinary and chillingly evil.\n\nIn it, H\u00f6ss described himself as man committed to discipline and dedicated to order. He wrote that it was \u201cto protect the mental health\u201d of his guards that he decided to utilize Zyklon B, an insecticide he used to murder as many Jews as effectively as possible.\n\nDuring H\u00f6ss\u2019s three and a half years at the camp, four additional gas chambers were built intended for industrialized annihilation. More than 1.1 million people were murdered there, making Auschwitz-Birkenau the deadliest of all the Nazi camps.\n\nThe belongings of those deported to the camp on the train tracks leading to Auschwitz, circa 1945.

The movie highlights the \u2018banality of evil,\u2019 a phrase coined by Hannah Arendt, and puts forward the idea that the commandant was just a person, not a monster.\n\n\u201cHuman beings did this to other human beings and it\u2019s very convenient for us to try and distance ourselves from them because we think we can never behave this way, but I think we should be less certain than that,\u201d said the movie\u2019s director Jonathan Glazer.\n\nH\u00f6ss\u2019s diary also helps readers understand more about the family\u2019s life at 88 Legionow Street and the lengths they went to to protect their children. The frosted windows, the high walls, a revved-up motorcycle outside gas chamber number 1 to drown out the cries of the people inside.\n\nAround a million people were killed at Auschwitz, the vast majority of them were Jewish. CNN\n\nIn the memoir, H\u00f6ss also recounts how he watched women and children being taken to the gas chambers.\n\n\u201cA woman approached me and pointed at her four children, who were helping the smallest ones over the rough ground, and whispered, \u2018How can you bring yourself to kill such beautiful darling children? Have you no heart at all?\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter witnessing such scenes, H\u00f6ss wrote, he would ride his horse to clear his mind.\n\nBut at no point did he appear to understand the horror of his actions. He called the extermination of the Jews a \u201cmistake\u201d rather than a crime and something that was the result of obeying too blindly orders from above, given, he says, on the basis of a mistaken ideology.\n\n\u201cLet the general public continue to regard me as a bloodthirsty beast, a cruel sadist, as the mass murderer of millions of human beings: for the masses could never imagine the commandant of Auschwitz in any other light,\u201d H\u00f6ss wrote. \u201cThey will never understand that I, too, had a heart.\u201d\n\nRudolf H\u00f6ss during his trial in Warsaw in March 1947. He was sentenced to death and hanged at Auschwitz. Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty Images\n\nH\u00f6ss went on the run after the liberation of Auschwitz, but was then captured, becoming the first person at such a senior level to admit the extent of the slaughter at the camp. He was made to testify at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg and was later condemned to death by a Polish tribunal.\n\nH\u00f6ss was hanged from the gallows between the camp and his house in 1947.\n\nThe surviving H\u00f6ss family continued to put a distance between themselves and what Rudolf H\u00f6ss had done. His wife Hedwig and daughter Brigitte moved to the United States following his execution. In an interview in 2013 with the Washington Post, Brigitte said: \u201cIt was a long time ago.

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe age of de-extinction may soon be a reality.\n\nAdvances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology are making resurrecting animals once lost to this world a tangible prospect. The organizations and companies at the forefront of de-extinction efforts are promising success \u2014 and surprisingly soon.\n\nThose efforts just got a boost. Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company behind plans to revive the woolly mammoth, dodo and Tasmanian tiger, announced Wednesday it has raised an additional $200 million in investment, bringing its total funding to $435 million. That hefty sum grew from an initial $15 million in 2021 when entrepreneur Ben Lamm and Harvard University geneticist George Church founded the Dallas-based company.\n\nWithin a decade or less, the world may see approximations of creatures only known from black-and-white photographs, taxidermy museum exhibits, and fossilized skeletons, with the ultimate goal of restoring the fauna to their natural habitat.\n\nAdvocates say resurrecting extinct animals is attracting new investors with deep pockets to conservation. The scientific field pushes the boundaries of biotechnology in a way that will make it possible to save other species on the brink and offers a promising way to better protect and preserve present-day ecosystems, ultimately making them more resilient to the climate crisis.\n\nSkeptics, however, argue the efforts are an underscrutinized pet project of millionaires, whose money could be spent more effectively elsewhere. Detractors also assert that scientists will only ever be able to engineer unsatisfactory imitations of extinct animals. Raising and breeding such creatures, some experts warn, could imperil living animals used as surrogates and the ecosystems into which resurrected individuals might ultimately be released.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to see a dodo? Good God, I do. A mammoth. I mean, wow, amazing,\u201d said Melanie Challenger, the deputy co-chair of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom.\n\nChallenger, who is the author of \u201cHow To Be Animal: A New History of What it Means To Be Human,\u201d argues that de-extinction is a fundamentally misleading term. \u201cIt\u2019s not de-extinction, it\u2019s genetically engineering a novel organism to fulfill the functions, theoretically, of an extant (living) organism. You\u2019re not bringing anything back from the dead,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all the way through the process, there are different, quite gnarly ethical considerations.\u201d\n\nA mammoth skeleton is seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in January 2023. Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nIs de-extinction really possible?\n\nScientists are pioneering and refining three techniques in their attempts to revive lost and rare species: cloning, genetic engineering, and traditional back breeding, a form of selective breeding that seeks to recreate lost traits from extinct species.\n\nFrom this resurrection tool kit, cloning has the capability to create an animal that\u2019s almost genetically identical. Dolly the Sheep became the first cloned mammal almost 30 years ago, and recently scientists successfully cloned the endangered black-footed ferret. But the process has been hit-and-miss, and it\u2019s unlikely to be useful in attempts to revive animals that disappeared a long time ago.\n\nNetherlands-based Grazelands Rewilding breeds a modern-day equivalent of the aurochs, an ox that features in prehistoric cave paintings. The giant animal disappeared from the wild in the 17th century. Aiming to restore wild landscapes in Europe, the group uses old-fashioned breeding methods, combined with some genetic knowledge, to identify the aurochs\u2019 traits in living descendants: domesticated cattle.\n\nNow on the seventh generation, the tauros cattle, as they have been named, are more than 99% genetically similar to the extinct aurochs, said Ronald Goderie, the project\u2019s managing director. The animals display physical changes, such as a darker coat color, and behavioral changes, such as how they respond to predators like wolves, over time.\n\nThe scientists at Colossal are behind the most ambitious projects. This team wants to resurrect the mammoth, the flightless dodo and Tasmanian tiger, an Australian marsupial that went extinct in 1936. Colossal plans to recreate these creatures by editing the genome of the extinct animal\u2019s closest living relative to make a hybrid animal that would be visually indistinguishable from its extinct forerunner. For the mammoth, that animal is the Asian elephant.\n\nHigh-profile investors in the endeavor include \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d director Peter Jackson, socialite Paris Hilton, former professional football player Tom Brady and professional golfer Tiger Woods; as well as investment firms such as Breyer Capital. The latest infusion of cash comes from TWG Global, the investment vehicle of Mark Walter, controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team and a co-owner of Chelsea Football Club in the UK.\n\nHow close are scientists to reviving lost species?\n\nWith the influx of capital, Lamm said the Colossal team may add another extinct animal to the to-do list as it makes headway in its three flagship projects.\n\nRecent milestones include creating the first induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, for Asian elephants. This special type of cell can be engineered in the lab to grow into any kind of elephant cell. It\u2019s an important tool as researchers model, test and refine the scores of genetic changes they need to make to give an Asian elephant the traits of a mammoth needed for survival in a cold climate.\n\nA Tasmanian tiger, also known as a thylacine, is seen in captivity, circa 1930. Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nFor the Tasmanian tiger or thylacine, Lamm said the pace of progress has been quicker than expected. Colossal scientists have been able to make 300 genetic edits into a cell line of a fat-tailed dunnart, which is the marsupial that Colossal has chosen as its base species and future surrogate. The company has sequenced what Lamm described as the highest-quality ancient genome to date for any animal.\n\nThe dodo is proving most challenging, Lamm said. Colossal has established a flock of Nicobar pigeons, the dodo\u2019s closest living relative, which will act as donors for primordial germ cells that will be genetically edited to have dodo characteristics.\n\nHowever, many of the developments have not been published in scientific journals, meaning they can\u2019t be scrutinized by other scientists as is typical during the peer-review process and won\u2019t become publicly available for the benefit of the research community.\n\nLamm said Colossal\u2019s mission as a business is not to publish scientific papers, which is a monthslong, if not yearslong, process. However, he said that a paper on the creation of elephant iPSCs is in peer review. The company\u2019s academic partners are planning to submit their work to journals, including the thylacine genome, in time, he added.\n\nColossal has recruited respected high-profile scientists, and many other experts act in advisory roles, including some initially skeptical of some of the company\u2019s goals. They include molecular paleobiologist Beth Shapiro, Colossal\u2019s chief science officer, who is currently on a leave of absence from her role as professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California Santa Cruz.\n\nShapiro is clear that de-extinction is not a solution to the extinction crisis, but she believes that the biotech tools she and her teams develop along the way can be applied more widely to protect and restore endangered species and ecosystems.\n\n\u201cTo be clear getting something that is 100% identical behaviorally, physiologically, genetically to a mammoth isn\u2019t possible,\u201d she told CNN in October. \u201cOnce a species is lost, it\u2019s gone, and we need to be investing in making sure that things don\u2019t become extinct.\u201d\n\nColossal is increasingly using its deep pockets to fund conservation efforts including work to save the world\u2019s most endangered rhino species: the northern white rhino. The company is also collaborating on the development of a vaccine for a herpes-like disease that can kill elephants. And Colossal has entered into a partnership with the conservation organization Re:wild to use biotechnology in its projects.\n\nEnd goals\n\nColossal\u2019s stated end goal for its mammoth project is a world where the elephant-mammoth hybrids lumber through the Arctic permafrost compressing the snow and grass that insulates the ground, slowing down permafrost thaw and the release of carbon contained in this fragile ecosystem.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to imagine herds of cold-adapted elephants making a significant impact on a region that\u2019s warming faster than anywhere else in the world in the time frame necessary to make a difference in the climate crisis, said Christopher Preston, a professor of environmental philosophy at the University of Montana.\n\nNevertheless, restoring lost species to fragile ecosystems has merit as a concept, added Preston, who is also author of \u201cTenacious Beasts: Wildlife Recoveries That Change How We Think About Animals.\u201d He said he was impressed by Grazelands Rewilding\u2019s tauros project, which he visited in the course of his work. The grazing habits of the hundreds of tauros cattle, herds of which also now live in parts of Spain, Czech Republic, Croatia and Romania, play a role in recreating an open landscape where other species can thrive.\n\nHowever, Clare Palmer, a professor of philosophy at Texas A&M University who specializes in animal and environmental ethics, noted that ecosystems are changing rapidly. She said bringing back animals may not work if the landscape is no longer the same.\n\n\u201cWe also don\u2019t have good knowledge of the welfare needs of members of extinct species and the offspring, for instance, would not be taught by their parents how to hunt, or forage, or relate to other species members,\u201d Palmer said.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJustin Baldoni has sued Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging that the Hollywood couple sought to \u201cdestroy\u201d him and his career, after hijacking his film, \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d\n\nBaldoni\u2019s complaint is the latest escalation in the ongoing legal battle stemming from the film that Baldoni directed and co-starred in with Lively.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case about celebrities sniping at each other in the press. This is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\n\u201cLively wields immense power as one of the world\u2019s best-known celebrities,\u201d the suit continues, alleging that Lively \u201cused that power to seize control of the film,\u201d which was directed by Baldoni, and produced and co-financed by Baldoni\u2019s production company. \u201cShe set out to destroy Plaintiffs\u2019 livelihoods and businesses if they did not bend to her incessant demands, and when they refused to give way, she did exactly that, accusing them of foul and reprehensible sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe 179-page complaint \u2014 in which Baldoni is seeking $400 million and demanding a jury trial \u2014 was filed in the Southern District of New York on behalf of Baldoni, his company Wayfarer Studios, as well as his producing partner, Jamey Heath, his crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, his publicist Jennifer Abel and the It Ends With Us LLC. The defendants are accused of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.\n\n\u201cLively stole Wayfarer\u2019s movie, hijacked Wayfarer\u2019s premiere, destroyed Plaintiffs\u2019 personal and professional reputations and livelihood, and aimed to drive Plaintiffs out of business entirely,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nLively\u2019s legal team told CNN in a statement Thursday that Baldoni\u2019s suit \u201cis another chapter in the abuser playbook. This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success,\u201d the statement also said.\n\nThe ongoing saga between Lively and Baldoni erupted in December, when Lively first filed a civil rights complaint, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni during production of the film and then was retaliated against for speaking up about her alleged mistreatment. Baldoni immediately denied Lively\u2019s claims.\n\nLively eventually escalated her civil rights complaint, officially filing a lawsuit against Baldoni just weeks ago.\n\nLively alleged that after being sexually harassed with inappropriate comments and behavior on set, Baldoni\u2019s team then orchestrated a smear campaign against her to ruin her reputation in the public sphere. Lively\u2019s complaint contained hundreds of text messages between Baldoni and his crisis PR team, including one text that read they could \u201cbury\u201d her.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s new suit presents a much different perspective, accusing Lively of actually defaming Baldoni.\n\n\u201cThough Lively claimed Baldoni was the one smearing her, the reality is that it was Lively and her team who carefully planned and implemented a vile smear campaign against Baldoni and Wayfarer to deflect attention and blame for Lively\u2019s disastrous misjudgments,\u201d Baldoni\u2019s suit states. \u201cLively would recast herself as the long-suffering martyr by portraying Baldoni and Wayfarer as her persecutors: the masterminds behind a smear campaign that evidence will show did not exist.\u201d\n\nThe public legal battle has exposed the inner workings of the teams behind Hollywood stars with multiple lawsuits, all of which have accused publicists on both sides of wrongdoing.\n\nLively and Reynolds\u2019 publicist, Leslie Sloan, is also named as a defendant alongside Lively and Reynolds in the complaint filed Thursday.\n\nSloan did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on her behalf or for her clients, Lively and Reynolds.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s team has said that Lively\u2019s lawsuit contained \u201ccherry picked\u201d text messages that only told her side of the story.\n\nAfter Lively filed her initial complaint, Baldoni sued the New York Times in a $250 million lawsuit, accusing the newspaper \u2014 which was first to report on Lively\u2019s allegations \u2014 of working alongside Lively\u2019s team to publish a one-sided article that benefited Lively and contained doctored evidence. Baldoni\u2019s suit against the publication contained more text messages that appeared to show additional context.\n\nThe New York Times has denied Baldoni\u2019s allegations and said it stands by their reporting.\n\nBryan Freedman, the attorney representing Baldoni and all plaintiffs, told CNN in a statement on Thursday that he has an \u201coverwhelming amount of untampered evidence\u201d that proves Lively, Reynolds and their team attempted to destroy Baldoni and his team by \u201cdisseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cMs. Lively will never again be allowed to continue to exploit actual victims of real harassment solely for her personal reputation gain at the expense of those without power.\u201d\n\nCreative differences\n\n\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d explores intimate partner violence. The central couple is played by Baldoni and Lively. The film, based on the best-selling book of the same name, made more than $350 million globally at the box office.\n\n\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d his suit states.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s lawsuit claims that Lively sought to take over much of the film\u2019s creative direction, including having her husband, Reynolds, re-write a scene and make \u201cunauthorized changed to the script in secret.\u201d (Reynolds had no formal role on \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d)\n\nJustin Baldoni and Blake Lively in \"It Ends With Us.\" Nicole Rivelli/Sony Pictures\n\nThe suit claims that Lively \u201csummoned\u201d Baldoni to the penthouse she shares with Reynolds in New York City for a meeting about the script, where Reynolds, along with a \u201cmegacelebrity friend\u201d of the couple, praised Lively\u2019s proposed revisions to the script.\n\n\u201cAs the meeting was ending, a famous, and famously close, friend of Reynolds and Lively, walked into the room and similarly began praising Lively\u2019s script,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cBaldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively\u2019s direction for the script.\u201d\n\nOne of the text messages included in Baldoni\u2019s suit appears to show an exchange between Baldoni and Lively about the script: \u201cI really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor),\u201d he wrote with a wink emoji. \u201cYou really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\u201d\n\nWhile Baldoni\u2019s text message does not include a last name for \u201cTaylor,\u201d Lively is close friends with the artist Taylor Swift. CNN has reached out to representatives for Baldoni, Lively, Reynolds and Taylor Swift to inquire whether the \u201cTaylor\u201d mentioned in Baldoni\u2019s text is, in fact, Swift.\n\nAccording to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit, a screenshot of a text message shows that Lively then replied to Baldoni, \u201cThat\u2019s very appreciated,\u201d then writing, \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d In that same text message, Lively later wrote, \u201cI have no motives except to you to win. As an actor. As a studio. As a writer. If you win, I win. If you win our movie wins. We are aligned. And I will bring everything I have to this.\u201d\n\nCNN has not independently verified any text messages included in Baldoni or Lively\u2019s lawsuits.\n\nThe new suit also claims that Reynolds once \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife\u201d at the couple\u2019s New York home. Baldoni denied the allegation in his lawsuit, stating he inquired about Lively\u2019s weight to his trainer so he could prepare for a scene in which he was supposed to lift her, while working with a back injury.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s latest lawsuit brings Reynolds \u2014 one of Hollywood\u2019s highest-earning A-list stars \u2014 into the legal drama. Baldoni\u2019s previous filings have mentioned Reynolds, but now he is officially named as a defendant, accused of assisting his wife in taking over the film and taking down Baldoni\u2019s career.\n\nAfter Lively\u2019s initial complaint accused Baldoni of sexual harassment, Baldoni was dropped as a client by the talent agency, WME, which also represents Lively and Reynolds. Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit accuses Reynolds of encouraging WME to drop Baldoni, which the agency has denied.\n\nIn the wake of Lively\u2019s lawsuit, Baldoni was also rescinded an award from a women\u2019s organization. Baldoni\u2019s public image has been intertwined with feminism \u2013 the actor and filmmaker hosted a TED Talk and a podcast about redefining masculinity.",

Gen. Amir Avivi told Fox News that the incoming president was one of the major reasons this deal was agreed upon, even though it had been on the table since May.\n\n\"Once President Trump threatened them, that if they don't release hostages, there will be hell\u2026 I think they understand that if they don't get a deal now, the chances of getting a good deal for them will be very, very low, if at all,\" Avivi said on FNC\u2019s \"Your World.\"\n\n\u2018WORST FAREWELL SPEECH IN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY\u2019: BIDEN'S OVAL OFFICE GOODBYE PANNED AS \u2018DARK\u2019\n\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby recognized Trump's incoming Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff as a key figure in brokering the deal.\n\nTrump last week warned Hamas that if all hostages weren\u2019t released by the time he returns to office, \"All hell will break out.\"\n\nDuss \u2014 who was once a foreign policy aide for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \u2014 told Politico how Trump\u2019s involvement affected the deal.\n\n\"Trump has made clear what he wants, he has his own priorities, and I think it was clearly the unconditional support that Biden gave that provided cover for Netanyahu to continue to prosecute this war, and also that there would be no costs for ignoring either private or public criticisms from the United States,\" he said.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s team joined, \"That calculus has changed,\" Duss noted.\n\nSandra Tamari, the executive director of Palestinian-led advocacy group Adalah Justice Project, admitted, \"We see Trump really trying to show that he\u2019s different than Biden, and that he\u2019s playing a strong man role, and in this instance, that worked.\"\n\nThough he didn\u2019t point to Trump\u2019s influence directly, Dearborn, Michigan\u2019s Wayne County Commissioner Sam Baydoun recognized that Biden couldn\u2019t get the deal done in May, calling the failure \"disappointing.\"\n\n\"Thousands of innocent civilians could have been spared if we had implemented this cease-fire back in May,\" he said. Still, he expressed relief that it was struck at all, saying on Thursday, \"Today\u2019s announcement is welcome news to all of us that this cycle of violence will end.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nReps for Trump's team and the Biden White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Joshua Comins contributed to this report.",

Understandably. We\u2019ve invested more in red states than blue states\u2026for two reasons. One, red states really screwed up in terms of the way they handled their economy and the way they handle manufacturing, the way they handle access to supply chains,\" Biden said.\n\nReports have found that Republican-led states like Florida and Texas recovered far more quickly than blue states after the pandemic.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nA new Fox News survey on Thursday showed almost twice as many people think the Biden administration has made the economy worse rather than better, 52% vs. 28%.

            "title": "JOE CONCHA: The 5 biggest losers from Team Trump's confirmation hearings",
            "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nIt's been the theater of the absurd in the Senate this week for President-elect Trump's Cabinet nominees, with Democrats playing the role of rogue clowns screaming (literally) for attention.\n\nIf you're just the average political observer, watching this show at home has likely been an annoying, infuriating and sometimes, comical experience. The questioning of Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for defense secretary, and Pam Bondi, his nominee for attorney general, has greatly diminished what was once a relatively dignified Senate chamber.\n\nSo, who were the biggest losers of the week in these confirmation hearings?\n\nGlad you asked.\n\n'MASTERCLASS': BONDI FLIPS SCRIPT ON DEM SENATOR AFTER SUGGESTING SHE WILL WEAPONIZE DOJ\n\n5. Sen. Richard Blumenthal\n\nHow this guy even shows his face at a confirmation hearing is truly something to behold. Blumenthal, you may recall, lied repeatedly about serving in Vietnam despite never setting foot outside U.S. soil at the time. The Connecticut Democrat even went so far as to say he and other soldiers suffered \"physical abuse\" upon returning to the U.S.\n\n\"I do not believe that you can tell this committee or the people of America that you are qualified to lead them. I would support you as a spokesperson for the Pentagon,\" Blumenthal piously said to Hegseth, without a hint of self-awareness, an actual veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan on multiple tours and earned two Bronze Stars and a Combat Infantryman Badge.\n\nDespite lying about his military service in the ultimate textbook example of Stolen Valor, Democrats put Blumenthal on the Armed Services Committee. What's next? Naming him to the Veterans Affairs Committee?\n\nOh, right... Rambo's on that committee too.\n\nTOP 5 MOMENTS FROM PETE HEGSETH'S SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING\n\n4. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nSpeaking of those who lied about their past in the most craptastic manner possible, the faux Native American-American lawmaker from Massachusetts really stepped in it on Tuesday when questioning Hegseth on his argument that generals should not go directly into the defense industry to avoid being later compromised if returning afterward to the Defense Department.\n\n\"You are quite sure every general who serves should not go directly into the defense industry for 10 years, but you're not willing to make that same pledge?\" a hysterical Warren asked Hegseth.\n\n\"I'm not a general, Senator,\" Hegseth deadpanned to laughter in the chamber.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Warren joined CNN's Kaitlyn Collins, who reported in the middle of the interview that Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst had committed to supporting Hegseth. That news all but clinched the feeling that Hegseth will be confirmed. Warren noticeably grimaced upon hearing the news. A clip of that moment has since gone viral.\n\n3. Sen. Adam Schiff\n\nAnd speaking, yet again, of prolific liars on Capitol Hill, look no further than the newly-elected California Democrat senator, who was censured in the House for lying, over several years, that he had direct evidence that then-President Trump had colluded with the Kremlin to turn the 2016 election in his favor. That evidence, of course, has yet to be produced.\n\nDuring his interrogation of likely-incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi, Schiff played the role of White Knight for the newly-minted Democrat darling Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming House Republican.\n\n\"I\u2019m asking you, sitting here today, whether you are aware of a factual predicate to investigate Liz Cheney?\" Schiff demanded.\n\n\n\n\"Senator, no one has asked me to investigate Liz Cheney. That is a hypothetical,\" Bondi responded.\n\n\"The president has called for it publicly. You are aware of that, aren\u2019t you?\" Schiff shot back.\n\n\"No one has asked me to investigate Liz,\" Bondi insisted before later adding, \"You know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof. Your robberies are 87% higher than the national average. That\u2019s what I want to be focused on, Senator, if I am confirmed as attorney general.\"\n\nAnd Bondi is 100% correct. Instead of obsessing over all-things Trump (as Liz Cheney also does), perhaps consider the fact that Schiff represents California, which is basically under one-party rule and has seen more residents leave than any other state in the country for a myriad of good reasons, especially crime.\n\n2. Sen. Mazie Hirono\n\nIf anyone encapsulates just how ridiculous some of the questioning was during these hearings, look no further than the pride of the Pacific.\n\nHere\u2019s the Hawaii Democrat speaking to Bondi:\n\n\"Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?\"\n\nBondi: \"No, Senator.\"\n\nHirono: \"Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement relating to this kind of conduct?\"\n\nBondi: \"No, Senator.\"\n\nLet's be clear: Bondi has NEVER been remotely accused of any of these allegations. Hirono knows this, but threw it out there in an effort to get it into the public record and on national TV.\n\nThis exchange on Wednesday was classic, but Hirono's notes had no rebuttal written for her.\n\nHIRONO: \"Does illegal immigration poison the blood of our nation?\"\n\nBONDI: \"I went to the border and visited a rape crisis center, and it was horrific... I'm sure you've been to the border as well.\"\n\nHIRONO: \"Let's move on.\"\n\nGame. Set. Match. Say hello to your next attorney general, America.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\n1. Sen. Tim Kaine\n\nThe winner of our biggest losers rundown was the easiest selection on the list, because Virginia Democrat Kaine \u2014 who looked like he just rolled out of bed during these hearings \u2014 was that bad.\n\nExhibit A: Kaine at one point during his questioning of Hegseth tried to make the argument that since the nominee had been twice divorced, he therefore couldn't be counted on to uphold his oath as Defense secretary when he couldn't be counted on to uphold his oath of marriage.\n\nYep. The same Tim Kaine, who was former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's running mate and who didn't utter one peep about Bill Clinton's multiple martial transgressions (the former president has also been accused of rape)... the same Tim Kaine who campaigned with Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, who cheated on his first wife with the nanny, had the audacity to sit in judgment of Hegseth. And his questions were focused on personal matters that occurred years ago.\n\n\"I'm not a perfect person. I'm not claiming to be. I have failed at things in my life and thankfully I'm redeemed by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,\" Hegseth perfectly responded.\n\nDemocrats showed this week they clearly learned nothing from the last election. The loud, pious lectures came from those who really need a large mirror to reflect on themselves.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe party did itself no favors this week. Democrats looked and sounded like members of a losing party married to a losing brand while embracing cheesy performance art to play to the type of people who still watch MSNBC and CNN.\n\nTrump will get his Cabinet confirmed.

We will always be a strong partner for [the] U.S. We are close neighbors. We have been incorporated in the last 80 years. And I think in the future, we have a lot to offer, to cooperate with.

And basically, all the goodwill that they used to have is almost gone now,\" said another man.\n\nOne Greenlander, J\u00f8rgen Boassen, who\u2019s been a Trump supporter for years, explained that his homeland is both the \"front door\" to the United States and foreign adversaries like Russia and China.\n\n\u2018MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN\u2019: TRUMP'S HOUSE GOP ALLIES UNVEIL BILL TO AUTHORIZE COUNTRY'S PURCHASE\n\nFox News anchor Bret Baier asked Egede if Greenlanders would vote for independence from Denmark if given the opportunity.\n\n\"Yeah, but it's up to the Greenlandic people to decide when we want to be independent. And I think it's important to see that if Greenland take[s] those steps, we will always be a part of the Western alliance and a strong partner for [the] U.S. because your security is our security,\" he replied.\n\nThe prime minister acknowledged the vast and rare earth minerals in Greenland, such as zinc, gold and uranium, and called for stronger partnerships with the United States and the European Union so the territory can diversify its economy and gain investments.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We have a lot to offer.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over whether the U.S. is heading toward an oligarchy.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Biden said in his farewell address that \"an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights, freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.\"\n\nIn response, Sanders said he agreed with Biden and specifically called out tech giants Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg during Bessent\u2019s confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\"The three billionaires you listed all made their money themselves,\" Bessent said. \"Mr. Musk came to the country as an immigrant.\"\n\nGET TO KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET: WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PICKED SO FAR?\n\nSanders cut Bessent off and reiterated his question.\n\n\"Well, I would note that President Biden gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to two people who I think would qualify for his oligarchs,\" Bessent said.\n\nBessent\u2019s comment referred to billionaires George Soros and David Rubenstein, who received the award from Biden earlier this month. Bessent, a hedge fund billionaire himself, previously worked for Soros.\n\n\"This is not a condemnation of any one, individual,\" Sanders said. \"I\u2019m just asking you, with so few people [having] so much wealth and power, do you think that is an oligarchic form of society?\"\n\n\"Senator, I think it depends on the ability to move up and down the income,\" Bessent said.\n\nTRUMP TELLS EU TO BUY MORE AMERICAN-MADE OIL AND GAS OR FACE 'TARIFFS ALL THE WAY'\n\nSanders interrupted Bessent again and eventually dropped the topic before asking Bessent whether the hedge fund billionaire would \"work with those of us who want to raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage to take millions of Americans out of poverty.\"\n\n\"Senator, I believe that the minimum wage is more of a state and regional issue,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"You don\u2019t think we should change the federal minimum wage?\" Sanders said. \"We have $7.25 an hour.\"\n\n\"No sir,\" Bessent replied.\n\nSanders is an outspoken advocate for raising the federal minimum wage and introduced legislation in 2023 that would raise it to $17 by 2028.\n\nSanders\u2019 home state of Vermont boosted its minimum wage from $13.67 to $14.01 per hour this month. The federal minimum wage has remained $7.25 since 2009.\n\nTRUMP TREASURY PICK: EXTENDING TRUMP TAX CUTS \u2018SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUE\u2019\n\nBessent discussed a range of policy issues with lawmakers Thursday, including tariffs, tax cuts and sanctions against Russia.\n\nBessent said renewing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump approved during his first administration is paramount. Many of the reforms in the measure are slated to sunset in 2025, but failing to renew the cuts would undermine the middle and working classes, Bessent said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"This is the single most important economic issue of the day,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"If we do not renew an extension, then we will be facing an economic calamity.

            "title": "Female Pro Boxer & Her Coach Blast USA Boxing Transgender Policy: 'Isn't Right'",
            "text": "In 2023, USA Boxing announced a new transgender policy that allows males who have undergone sex reassignment surgery \u2013 and maintain a specific testosterone level \u2013 to compete in women's boxing.\n\nSarah Cunningham, a professional boxer in Michigan, told OutKick that she was upset when the organization made the decision that would ultimately allow males to fight females in the ring.\n\n\"A male has a different body structure, bone structure, and muscle structure\u2026 and that's what gives them an advantage,\" Cunningham, who is also a registered nurse and sports dietitian, said.\n\n\"Having them come over and take over women's sports\u2026 [even if] they've had surgery, it still doesn't make it right.\"\n\nCunningham stressed that she has no issues with people identifying how they choose, if it makes them happy. But she said that despite having empathy for transgender people, allowing them to compete in women's sports is wrong.\n\n\"If you think you're another gender, I really don't care. I'm all for being happy, everybody deserves happiness,\" she said. \"But in terms of competing and boxing, and going from male into female, that's a different story because your body is different. It doesn't have anything to do with what you have underneath your clothes.\"\n\nOne of the major issues with the USA Boxing policy is that the organization is not obligated to tell women that they might be matched against a male. That's something to which Cunningham's coach, Jeff Watters, strongly objected.\n\n\"My biggest question [for USA Boxing] is would I be notified if one of my girls was about to fight, essentially, a guy? I don't mean to sound insensitive, but if my girl was going to have to fight a guy, would I be told ahead of time because I'm not good with it and I would pull her out of it,\" he said.\n\n\"And I was told that they would not be obligated to let me know. They would not even be obligated to let the promoter know.\"\n\nThat's when Watters started posting on social media, raising his objection to the new policy that would not only allow males to box against females, but to do so potentially without making the female opponent aware of the situation.\n\nWatters noted that other people in the boxing community felt the same way he did, but many were afraid to voice their opinions publicly for fear of blowback from USA Boxing.\n\n\"The shows we did after that, the promoters all felt the same way. They just couldn't say it, you know?\" he said.\n\nAfter Watters made his concerns public, he said that's when he started to run into problems with USA Boxing. Because Watters runs a gym, he must be licensed through USA Boxing, or risk losing the insurance on his gym.\n\n\"Once I started to post things and tag them on it, regarding my opposition to their new policy, my licensing got held up for a while. My coaching license got held up for a while as well,\" Watters said.\n\nHe added that he had been a USA Boxing coach since 2018 and had never experienced a problem with licensing renewal. At least, not until he started publicly voicing frustration over the transgender policy.\n\nOutKick reached out to USA Boxing regarding Watters' claims, but they could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nSarah Cunningham had her own issues with social media, with regard to her opposition to the transgender policy, but hers came directly from Instagram. Cunningham told OutKick that Instagram removed some of her posts and deemed them as \"misinformation.\"\n\nHer posts were about Imane Khelif, the fighter who won Olympic gold in women's boxing despite previously failing gender tests. She shared those posts with OutKick:\n\nCunningham's biggest complaint with the transgender policy, not just in boxing but in all sports, is that many governing bodies use testosterone level as the determining factor. But because of Cunningham's medical background, she's acutely aware that more goes into determining athletic performance than one hormone level.\n\n\"I've been a nurse for over 21 years, and a single testosterone level doesn't mitigate all the biological advantages of being born male,\" she said.\n\nDespite the issues, both Cunningham and Watters continue to train and fight, not just in the ring, but for fairness in the sport that they both love.",

            "text": "President Biden leaves office with negative job and personal ratings, as voters continue to give the economy bad marks \u2014 and say the White House failed to make improvements.\n\nA new Fox News survey shows almost twice as many think the Biden administration has made the economy worse rather than better, 52% vs. 28%. Plus, nearly all voters, 89%, say they are either extremely or very concerned about inflation \u2014 up from 83% early in his term (2021).\n\nOverall, 70% say the economy is in bad shape. While that\u2019s better than the high during Biden\u2019s term of 84% who rated it negatively in July 2022, it\u2019s also back to where things stood at the start of his presidency when 69% said the same.\n\n\"Despite presiding over the strongest post-pandemic economic recovery in the world and making historic investments in infrastructure that will produce millions of new jobs over the next decade, voters clearly judged Biden\u2019s efforts on the economy as counterproductive,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose firm Beacon Research conducts Fox News surveys along with Republican Daron Shaw. \"Time will tell if history judges him differently.\"\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP IS THE MOST POPULAR HE'S EVER BEEN\n\nOnly 13% of voters say they are getting ahead financially. Three times that many, 42%, feel they are falling behind \u2014 and that\u2019s up 15 points from 27% who felt that way nearly four years ago.\n\nPart of that increase is driven by Democrats, who are twice as likely to say they are falling behind today: 38% vs. 19% in June 2021.\n\nAnd nearly 6 in 10 Democrats agree with 8 in 10 Republicans and 7 in 10 independents that the economy is in only fair or poor condition.\n\n\"If elections are mostly about how voters think the incumbent party handled the economy, it\u2019s easy to see why the Democrats lost the 2024 election,\" says Shaw. \"Unfortunately for Biden, he continues to be ineffective at making the case that his policies have improved the bottom-line, even among his base.\"\n\nAs Biden departs, 42% of voters approve of his job performance \u2014 just 2 percentage points above his record low.\n\nApproval of Biden is lower than Barack Obama (57%) and Bill Clinton (62%) at the end of their presidencies, but higher than George W. Bush (34%). Some 47% approved of Donald Trump at the end of his first term.\n\nBiden\u2019s highest approval, 56%, came six months into his presidency (June 2021). His lowest, 40% approval, came at three points during his term (July 2022, November 2023 and October 2024).\n\nThe average job rating for his entire presidency stands at 44% approve vs. 55% disapprove.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS VIEW 2024 NEGATIVELY BUT HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE\n\nEighty percent of Democrats approve of Biden as he leaves, as do 35% of independents and 9% of Republicans. For comparison, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, 95% of Democrats approved, as did 42% of independents and 14% of Republicans.\n\nViews on Biden as a person are the reverse of what they were when he was elected. At the end of 2020, some 59% of voters had a favorable opinion of him, while 39% had an unfavorable opinion. The final read shows 40% view him favorably and 59% unfavorably.\n\nThat makes him less popular than Trump at the end of his first term (45% favorable, 54% unfavorable), and Obama (60%-39%), Bush (49%-46%) and Clinton (48%-46%) at the end of their time in office.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump\u2019s current favorable rating tells the story of the moment: a record 50% of voters have a positive view of him, and 50% view him negatively.\n\nConducted Jan. 10-13 under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 922 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (114) and cellphones (638) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (170).

The HGTV star's lawyer claimed in an Oct. 10 legal filing obtained by Fox News Digital that the request was \"outrageous\" because Hall is \"self-supporting.\"\n\n\"The claim by [Josh] that he sent a good faith settlement offer is not an accurate characterization of the communication. The Petitioner Josh Hall requesting $65,000 per month in Spousal Support from [Christina] on a 2-year, 9-month marriage when he is self-supporting is hardly good faith,\" the documents read. \"[Josh] just paid $70,000 to pay off the lease on [his] separate property Bentley and so he has no need for spousal support from [Christina].\"\n\nHowever, Hall slammed the claim with a statement shared on social media: \"So now @dearmeylaw files legal declarations with lies and assumptions\u2026 interesting tactic for someone who is a licensed attorney and took an oath of integrity,\" he wrote on his Instagram story at the time. \"Pretty sure making provably false statements to a judge is unethical.\"\n\nMoney issues have seemed to be a reoccurring spot of conflict for the former couple. Haack previously accused Hall of transferring $35,000 from her bank account into his personal account just one day after the divorce filing.\n\n\"I would not have asked him to send himself my money the day after I told him we are getting divorced,\" Haack stated in court documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHaack was married twice before meeting Hall and secretly tying the knot in 2021. She was married to fellow HGTV star Tarek El Moussa from 2009 until 2018. The former couple share two children, daughter Taylor and son Brayden.\n\nBefore marrying Hall in 2021, Haack finalized her divorce with her second husband, Ant Anstead. Haack and Anstead married in 2018 and share a son together.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

            "text": "SpaceX's gigantic Starship rocket has been \"lost\" just minutes into its seventh test flight.\n\nThe 400ft rocket - the biggest and most powerful in the world - soared from Boca Chica, south Texas, on Thursday around 4.40pm local time (10.40pm in the UK).\n\nJust minutes after the rocket launched, its booster made its planned return to the ground and after momentarily hovering over the launchpad, it was spectacularly caught between two giant mechanical arms.\n\nIt's the second time SpaceX has managed this particular feat.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:34 SpaceX completes booster capture\n\nHowever, as crowds cheered the booster's return, the company said it had lost contact with Starship as the engines went out.\n\nA host on SpaceX's livestream soon confirmed: \"At this point in time, we can confirm we did lose the ship.\n\n\"It looks like we lost contact a little under eight and a half minutes into the flight.\"\n\nImage: SpaceX's rocket made the test flight from a launch site in Boca Chica, Texas.

Pic: Reuters\n\nImage: Pic: Reuters\n\nThe flight was the seventh test run for the newly-upgraded Starship, and marked the next step in Elon Musk's bid to build the first fully reusable spacecraft to get humans to Mars.\n\n\"Every Starship launch is one more step closer towards Mars,\" he said on X before lift-off.\n\nMusk and Bezos heading for space showdown Thomas Moore Science correspondent @SkyNewsThomas The two richest people on the planet are heading for a showdown in space. Elon Musk versus Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: they both launched prototype rockets on the same day, a rivalry with billions of dollars at stake. SpaceX's Starship is fuelled by Musk's extraordinary appetite for risk. He innovates through failure, and the seventh test flight didn't go entirely to plan. Contact was lost with the upper part of the rocket eight minutes into the flight and engineers will be studying the data to work out why. But the booster, which had already separated, successfully returned to base. Read the rest of Thomas's analysis\n\nThe Starship prototype had been modified significantly since its sixth test flight in November.\n\nIt was due to soar across the Gulf of Mexico on a near-loop around the world and SpaceX had packed it with dummy satellites, so it could practice releasing them.\n\nX X , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

In November 2023, the company's second attempt at launching its mega rocket ended abruptly when the vessel was lost following explosions.",

My team and I spotted an elderly woman at the end of a driveway.\n\n\n\n\"I don't drive, I don't have any relatives,\" she said. \"What do I do?\"\n\n\n\nIt was 84-year-old Liz Lerner. She grasped my arm as the wind almost blew her off her feet. A neighbour showed up shortly afterwards, loading his Tesla with bags, and agreed to give Liz a ride to safety.\n\nImage: Liz Lerner last week with Sky's Marth Kelner before her home was destroyed\n\nLA wildfires latest updates\n\n\n\nA week on, she's in hospital in Los Angeles and wants to tell the dramatic story of her escape and what came next.\n\n\"I thought I would die right there on the sidewalk,\" she says. \"I thought that was the end of my little life. I really thought that there's nobody coming by here and I'll just be a skeleton they find.\"\n\nAs Liz was being driven by her neighbour, down the hill from Pacific Palisades to the coast, all around the neighbourhood, trees and buildings were catching fire.\n\n\"As we drove through the windy streets to get out, it was greyer and blacker and darker,\" she says. \"I felt a great heaviness pushing on my chest at that time. I'm gasping and gasping just trying to get some air. I was having a heart attack, I found out at the hospital.\"\n\nLiz is also being treated at Kaiser Permanente hospital in LA for smoke inhalation.\n\nImage: Sky's Martha Kelner with Liz Lerner in hospital\n\nOn the TV in her hospital ward she has been watching some of the news reports about the fire which has ravaged her community. She knows her home has been destroyed and wants to see pictures of it. \"Wow,\" she says, open-mouthed as she looks at a photograph. \"There's nothing left, nothing at all.\"\n\nIt is a house her dad built in 1949, which she inherited and has made her own. Then she notices her wrought iron gate is still partially standing. \"My gate,\" she exclaims. \"I designed that. I would like to get it back.\"\n\nImage: All that remains of Liz Lerner's Palisades home\n\nLiz's daughter, Skye, died 10 years ago and precious reminders of her life have also been lost with the fire.\n\n\"I saved all the paintings that she did in first grade. I lost all of those, all the stories she wrote, the birthday cards with the scribbles on them. It's those normal things, that's the worst of it.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nBecause of the wildfire risk in her area, Liz says her home insurance was cancelled several years ago.\n\n\"I have no insurance, absolutely none, and no documents and no cheques and no credit cards. I don't even have a pair of shoes.\"\n\nLiz hopes to be discharged from hospital soon, to a retirement home where she will share a room with another elderly woman. Her life is forever altered and she will never return to the place she once called her \"forever home\".\n\nThe rebuilding of the decimated Pacific Palisades will happen, but for Liz it will take too long.",

If Trump follows through on his proposal to impose 60 percent tariffs on China and 20 percent on other countries, the potential for disruption and chaos is significant.\n\nBut beyond the short-term pain, is there a positive case to be made for tariffs? And if so, what would it be? Enter the conservative economist Oren Cass, the founder of the increasingly influential think tank American Compass. A cast of rising Republican figures, including Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, have amplified Cass\u2019s work diagnosing the harms inflicted on the American heartland through free trade and globalization. Cass also contributed to Project 2025, the conservative policy tome that looked to shape the Trump 2.0 agenda.\n\nCass doesn\u2019t speak for Trump and doesn\u2019t seem to be seeking a role in the next administration. But Trump\u2019s disruption of the status quo has created room to elevate Cass\u2019s ideas\u2014especially as a new generation of Republican politicians step up to shape policy. I spoke with Cass on FP Live about Trump\u2019s economic plans. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript.\n\nRavi Agrawal: I want to have a broad conversation about the American economy, but let\u2019s start with tariffs. U.S. tariffs have consistently fallen from the 1940s to about 2016, when Trump was elected for the first time. Explain to us what the reversal of this trend is solving for.\n\nOren Cass: The problem we\u2019ve seen over that full period, but really over the last 25 years or so\u2014especially since China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization [in 2001]\u2014is that free trade has not worked at all how most economists predicted. There was a great deal of noise about how all economists unanimously predicted that free trade with China would be a wonderful benefit for the United States, its workers, and the strength of its economy. We lowered tariffs and lowered barriers on that basis. We have not seen the benefits that were promised. In many cases, we\u2019ve seen the reverse. Certainly, we do have more cheap stuff in the United States, but I think the vast majority of Americans would rightly say it has not, on net, been beneficial.\n\nAnd so we have this conflict now where a lot of economists are still using those exact same models from 25 years ago. And unsurprisingly, those models that say free trade is a wonderful benefit also say going in the other direction would have costs that exceed the benefits. Once you realize and admit that those previous models were wrong, that they got the trade-off backward, you can\u2019t continue to use those models to argue against less free trade. You have to recognize that less free trade is going to benefit the people. We need to be focused on those who have been left behind.\n\nRead more",

            "text": "On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas launched an attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,200 Israelis and another 250 being taken as hostages. Afterward, Israel launched a ferocious military campaign that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza and devastated most of the Gaza Strip. Both Israel and Hamas hesitated to end the conflict, even as the suffering of civilians in Gaza mounted. Hamas feared that a temporary pause in fighting in exchange for a hostage release, as opposed to a permanent cease-fire, would simply lead to Israel to redouble its campaign once its own people were out of harm\u2019s way.

Afterward, Israel launched a ferocious military campaign that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza and devastated most of the Gaza Strip.

Israel, for its part, expressed its desire that the militant group be destroyed completely. Aside from this sweeping demand, Israel wanted more hostages released and to keep a lasting military presence in the Philadelphi Corridor, along the border between Gaza and Egypt, among other demands. U.S. officials, along with negotiators from Qatar and Egypt, tried repeatedly to bridge these differences.\n\nOn the Hamas side, the logic of a cease-fire is straightforward: The organization is devastated. Israel claims that it has killed 17,000 Hamas fighters, destroyed much (though probably not a majority) of Hamas\u2019s tunnel network and other infrastructure, and killed many of Hamas\u2019s senior leaders. This is not an empty boast: Since Oct. 7, Israel has killed numerous Hamas leaders, both in Gaza and outside it, including Ismail Haniyeh, its top leader; Mohammed Deif, its military chief; and Yahya Sinwar, the leader and architect of the Oct. 7 operation who briefly replaced Haniyeh as head of Hamas. Aside from these losses, Hamas\u2019s popularity is falling. Gaza is in ruins, and most Gazans, who once supported the attack on Israel, now consider it a mistake . Its ally Hezbollah has dropped out of the war after suffering its own set of devastating losses from Israeli attacks, and Iran is also licking its wounds. With Israeli troops killing mid-level Hamas leaders, as well as its rank and file, the group could not rebuild.\n\nFor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, ending the war has proven politically difficult. Netanyahu\u2019s extreme right-wing coalition has favored an unbending policy toward Hamas, seeking its utter destruction. Netanyahu has embraced this line, but what it means in practice is unclear. His cabinet must still approve the deal.\n\nDespite inflicting repeated blows on Hamas, Israel has done nothing to ensure that there is a successor to Hamas in Gaza that can displace it in the long term. As a result, the group may slowly regenerate, regaining at least some influence in Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s own political difficulties\u2014he is currently on trial for corruption\u2014put him in a vulnerable position, increasing the risk of any move that his coalition members do not support. Moreover, with a cease-fire, there will be a reckoning for the failures of Oct. 7 itself, including Netanyahu\u2019s own role in allowing Hamas to build up and prioritizing other theaters over Gaza. No longer can Netanyahu deflect calls for an investigative commission into the attack by saying that the country is at war.\n\nIsrael, however, is also exhausted by war, and the Gaza operations have, for many months now, been yielding diminishing returns. Yoav Gallant, Israel\u2019s former defense minister, admitted months ago that Israel no longer had any real military mission in Gaza. Killing yet another mid-level Hamas leader or cluster of Hamas fighters matters little in terms of the organization\u2019s strength. The international outrage Israel has faced, including declining support among young people and Democrats in the United States, may have long-term costs for Israel. Israeli public opinion favors a deal to release the hostages, and the military, which depends heavily on reserves, is exhausted by over a year of hard fighting.\n\nAlthough the deal has long been in the cards and probably would have occurred sooner had Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, timing it for a new administration also weighs on Israeli calculations. Biden administration officials can, and will, claim that their efforts ended a bloody war that tarnished the outgoing president\u2019s legacy among many Democrats. However, even if the cease-fire reflects the months of negotiations and constant proposals put forward by Biden officials, credit will go to President-elect Donald Trump. Politically, the deal enables Israel to score points with the new administration, which had promised to end the war upon taking office. Trump threatened that \u201call hell will break out in the Middle East\u201d if Hamas does not release its hostages\u2014what that meant in practice was unclear, but it certainly sounded scary. He also put significant pressure on Netanyahu to accept a deal, according to Israeli news reports. Trump will bask in the accomplishment, proclaiming that he instantly achieved what Biden could not in over a year. Israelis recognize the value of a close relationship with the United States and the need to gain the goodwill of the new administration.\n\nThe cease-fire might not last, or it may only be honored in the breach. If Hamas starts to regain power in parts of Gaza, Israeli leaders may strike to remove it, past promises be damned. They may also break the cease-fire to kill a particularly wanted leader. Hamas, for its part, may conduct attacks on remaining Israeli forces in Gaza or on any international or Palestinian group that tries to displace it. None of this may formally restart the war, but it will hinder aid organizations and efforts to rebuild the Gaza Strip. For Palestinians living in Gaza, a cease-fire is still good news, but conditions will remain grim for many years to come.",

            "text": "Despite President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s oft-deployed slogan of \u201cno new wars\u201d and claims that United States was at peace during his first administration, Washington both engaged in new conflicts and expanded and intensified existing ones without fresh congressional authorization under this leadership between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe U.S. president has significant latitude to use military force even in the absence of congressional authorization and even when such action would violate international law.

Through its military interventions in the Middle East since Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration has both further eroded the existing guardrails constraining presidential war powers and possibly bequeathed a new conflict with the Houthis to his successor.\n\nDespite President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s oft-deployed slogan of \u201cno new wars\u201d and claims that United States was at peace during his first administration, Washington both engaged in new conflicts and expanded and intensified existing ones without fresh congressional authorization under this leadership between 2017 and 2021.\n\nTrump\u2019s first four years in the White House revealed a commander in chief who, while erratic, had certain tendencies with respect to the use of military force. Due in part to his transactional nature, Trump was generally skeptical of large-scale U.S. military presence overseas and the value of U.S. alliances and partnerships. He was prone to one-upmanship with respect to U.S. military action\u2014launching attacks in part because prior presidents had refrained from them.\n\nGiven the wide freedom of action afforded the commander in chief and the might of the U.S. military, decisions by the incoming president on the use of force could be globally consequential. In light of those stakes, it is worth revisiting Trump\u2019s track record on the use of military force during his first term in office.\n\nWhen Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a narrowly focused U.S. military mission in the complicated battle space of the Syrian civil war. Despite broader policy objectives, his immediate predecessor, President Barack Obama, had limited direct military force in Syria to fight the Islamic State, rejecting calls from his advisors to attack Bashar al-Assad and enforce the administration\u2019s self-imposed \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapon use.\n\nDespite a monthslong review of the Obama administration\u2019s campaign plan to fight the Islamic State, the Trump administration\u2019s most notable initial shift was redubbing \u201cISIL\u201d to \u201cISIS.\u201d Although the destruction of the Islamic State\u2019s physical \u201ccaliphate\u201d and the killing of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ultimately occurred on Trump\u2019s watch in 2019, mostly his administration continued Obama\u2019s counterterrorism playbook.\n\nHowever, Trump had cause to revisit Obama\u2019s red line early in the administration when Assad\u2019s forces launched a deadly sarin attack on Khan Shaykhun in 2017, killing dozens of civilians, including children. According to two of Trump\u2019s children, Trump decided to strike in retaliation after seeing images of Syrian children fatally poisoned. Trump\u2019s statements also suggested that he wished to one-up Obama, critiquing his predecessor for failing to enforce the red line.\n\nYet, Trump\u2019s original retaliation plan wasn\u2019t implemented. According to reporter Bob Woodward and later partially confirmed by Trump, Trump called Defense Secretary Jim Mattis seemingly to demand the assassination of Assad, shouting, \u201cLet\u2019s fucking kill him! Let\u2019s go in. Let\u2019s kill the fucking lot of them.\u201d\n\nWoodward reports that Mattis told his subordinates, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that. We\u2019re going to be much more measured.\u201d (Trump has denied this account of events.) And so, the U.S. retaliation was more measured, consisting of airstrikes on the Shayrat airbase, which was allegedly used to conduct the fatal sarin attack.\n\nAlthough Trump was enthusiastic about killing terrorists, he had an aversion to anything he perceived as nation-building and was deeply skeptical of large-scale troop deployments. These sentiments contributed to his precipitous decision in December 2018 while on a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2014to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. The sudden move led to the Mattis\u2019s resignation.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s announcement, U.S. forces remained in Syria as officials in his administration walked back the decision of total withdrawal. This was partly due to Trump\u2019s intermittent focus on the matter and the separate, more ambitious Syria agendas of his underlings, some of whom were more interested in using U.S. troops to counter Iran rather than the Islamic State. Later, in October 2019, Trump did in fact partially pull back US troops in northern Syria at the urging of Turkey.\n\nTrump was also convinced by officials within his administration and members of Congress to retain some U.S. forces in Syria to \u201ckeep the oil.\u201d These advocates appealed to Trump\u2019s long-stated desire for concrete material benefit from U.S. military deployments. The reality that \u201ckeeping the oil\u201d was both impractical and illegal did not matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s policy shift on Iran was more dramatic. Obama left office having constrained Iran\u2019s nuclear program through a painstakingly crafted multilateral agreement while Tehran\u2019s paramilitary proxies in Iraq observed a wary truce with U.S. forces as they both fought the Islamic State.\n\nAfter firing many of the supposed adults in the room in his administration, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions to apply \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d These actions upended a tense modus vivendi in Iraq. With Tehran no longer restraining them, Iran-backed paramilitary groups based in Iraq resumed attacks on U.S. forces in 2018.\n\nEven so, Trump was not eager to engage in a major conflict with Iran. After the Iranian downing of a U.S. drone over the Persian Gulf in 2019, Trump ultimately refrained from the retaliatory attack advocated by his hawkish advisors\u2014reportedly due to cautionary counsel from Tucker Carlson. Trump also refrained from attacking Iran in response to Iranian missile strikes on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Despite publicly blaming Tehran for the September 2019 attack, Trump announced he would \u201clike to avoid\u201d conflict with Iran and indicated interest in a new nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic.\n\nYet, the Iran hawks surrounding Trump ultimately convinced him to take significant and provocative military action against Iran. According to reporting by Jack Murphy and Zach Dorfman, officials such as then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo began planning to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani as early as 2017. Continuing attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq from Iran-backed forces in late 2019 provided justification; he was ultimately killed in January 2020.\n\nWhat exactly Trump\u2019s advisors told him about the likely Iranian response to Suleimani\u2019s killing is unclear. But he does not seem to have expected the retaliatory ballistic missile barrage that Iran unleashed on U.S. troops in Iraq. Certainly, he sought to immediately downplay the attack in an effort to de-escalate with Iran\u2014tweeting out \u201call is well\u201d following the strikes. Trump has continued to minimize the injuries to U.S. troops\u2014more than 100 service members with traumatic brain injuries\u2014as headaches. Indeed, Pentagon officials were reportedly concerned that awarding Purple Hearts to wounded troops would undermine Trump\u2019s narrative.\n\nSuch predictable Iranian retaliation was the reason that both the Bush and Obama administrations had refrained from killing Suleimani.\n\nThe Trump administration, Iran hawks in Congress, and the commentariat have subsequently tried to cast Suleimani\u2019s killing as \u201crestoring deterrence\u201d vis-a-vis Iran. Such spin obscures not only Iran\u2019s immediate ballistic missile attack on U.S. troops, but also further attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq by Iran-backed groups during the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, some of which resulted in U.S. fatalities.\n\nIn Yemen, the Obama administration gave Trump a counterterrorism campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and a conflict with Houthi militants in which the United States was not directly fighting (apart from a single strike on Houthi radar facility in late 2016).\n\nStill, the United States was providing essential arms, maintenance, and spare parts for the ruinous bombing campaign waged by a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition. The coalition\u2019s penchant for using U.S. weapons to bomb Yemeni civilians\u2014and its failure to improve targeting over 18 months\u2014led the outgoing president to suspend precision-guided munition transfers to Saudi Arabia after its warplanes bombed a funeral in Sanaa, killing more than 100 civilians.\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s very first military actions as commander in chief was greenlighting a rare and risky commando raid against AQAP in Yemen that the outgoing Obama administration had forgone. The U.S. assault alongside forces from the United Arab Emirates resulted in numerous civilian casualties\u2014including children\u2014and the death of a U.S. Navy SEAL.\n\nTrump also promptly reversed Obama\u2019s lame-duck arms sales suspension. While he had little interest in direct U.S. military engagement in the Saudi-Houthi conflict, Trump was all too eager to sell weapons to Riyadh.\n\nAlthough his administration would later seek assurances from Saudi Arabia that it would use U.S. weapons consistent with the law of war, the desire to sell weapons overshadowed accountability. After Saudi Arabia used U.S.-supplied precision-guided munitions to attack a school bus full of Yemeni children in 2018, Trump characterized the strike as a \u201chorror show\u201d and candidly admitted that the Saudis \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to use the weapon.\u201d\n\nWhen the State Department\u2019s inspector general investigated U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the Department\u2019s efforts to limit civilian casualties, Trump fired the inspector general and the Department later suppressed the investigation\u2019s full results.\n\nThere is no crystal ball to predict how Trump will wield his power as commander-in-chief. The degree of Trump\u2019s personal involvement in policy, who he chooses to listen to, and the willingness or ability of his team to temper outlandish proposals are among the many sources of uncertainty.\n\nNonetheless, his record from 2017 to 2021 and subsequent statements\u2014particularly following the 2024 election\u2014could offer a preview of his agenda as commander in chief.\n\nTrump is no dove, and he is fond of issuing blustery military threats. (His recent comments regarding potential military action with respect to Greenland and Panama appear to be mostly trolling and bluster\u2014for now.) And though such threats alone may harm U.S. interests, he has often lacked follow through, and it seems he would avoid intentionally involving the United States in a major armed conflict. Indeed, he may again seek to remove U.S. forces from conflicts in Syria, Somalia, and potentially Iraq.\n\nYet, Trump\u2019s instincts should provide only limited comfort to those concerned about further U.S. wars. His willingness to escalate U.S. bombing campaigns in Somalia and Afghanistan before moving to withdraw U.S. forces could provide a template for how he will handle the conflict with the Houthis he may inherit. His track record with enabling Saudi Arabia\u2019s military campaign in Yemen suggests that he is happy to fuel other countries\u2019 wars, no matter how they are waged.\n\nAnd, as with the Suleimani strike, Trump may act heedlessly without fully appreciating the consequences of his actions\u2014particularly if encouraged by his advisors. In this respect, Trump\u2019s musings during his first term about missile strikes on Mexican drug cartels are particularly worrying.\n\nBy casting doubts on whether the United States would come to the defense of allies and partners, Trump may encourage adventurism by revisionist rivals as well as nuclear hedging by countries such as South Korea, which may decide that it is time for a level of self-reliance they have not previously considered necessary.\n\nTrump\u2019s boosters sometimes laud his unpredictability as a virtue that keeps foreign adversaries off balance and deterred. Whether it is a virtue or not, the commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military will again be unpredictable and likely even less constrained than he was during his first term given the weak guardrails on use of force by the U.S. president.",

            "text": "China\u2019s sixth-generation fighter jet has sparked renewed concerns about Beijing\u2019s advances in the ongoing arms race. It comes at a time when the United States has scaled back investments in next-generation air dominance under its latest defense budget. For U.S. military planners, this development significantly complicates operational scenarios, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, where China\u2019s enhanced offensive counterair and interdiction capabilities would necessitate a rapid deployment of additional intelligence and defensive assets.

It comes at a time when the United States has scaled back investments in next-generation air dominance under its latest defense budget. For U.S. military planners, this development significantly complicates operational scenarios, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, where China\u2019s enhanced offensive counterair and interdiction capabilities would necessitate a rapid deployment of additional intelligence and defensive assets. Such a capability shift underscores the need for the United States to reassess its air strategy in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe jet\u2019s unveiling marks a significant milestone in the evolving great-power contest between Washington and Beijing. This new Cold War is increasingly defined by technology competition. The CCP isn\u2019t just seeking to dominate core commercial technologies like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. It wants a deeper military-civil fusion that supports Beijing\u2019s ability to replicate a Cold War-era offset strategy, in which technological advantages tip the military balance.\n\nThere are also reasons to believe China\u2019s new aircraft is meant to be a signal to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his administration to counter the threat of tariffs and to substitute military signaling for economic statecraft. The fact is, Beijing is increasingly out of options to counter renewed U.S. coercive diplomacy. Since the U.S. presidential election last November, China has launched one of the world\u2019s largest amphibious warships, conducted its largest naval operation in decades, and unveiled a new airborne intelligence and command and control platform. As the new Trump foreign-policy team takes office, they should see these measures for what they are: a country bargaining from a position of weakness and likely prone to increased risk-taking and brinkmanship. By integrating military preparedness with economic and diplomatic strategies, the United States can counter China\u2019s technological gambits while reducing the risks of militarized disputes.\n\nRevealing new military capabilities follows a logical pattern in statecraft. As outlined in a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, states often reveal a new weapon of war during peacetime to substitute for more direct military confrontations. By signaling their military power, states bet their rivals will avoid escalation. Revealing new technologies is a form of coercive bargaining between states.\n\nTrump has threatened tariffs and promises to counter China. The J-36 can be seen as a coercive counterweight. After all, threats to sell U.S. treasuries are both hollow and self-defeating, and every time China seeks to manipulate trade and deny the export of critical minerals, it creates market incentives for all states to seek alternative sources.\n\nIn this context, a new aircraft is not an act of a superpower but instead indicates a strategic vulnerability. It also opens a window of increased risk for Trump\u2019s team, since China is likely to continue signaling its military strength. This ongoing show of force opens up the possibility of international crises and militarized disputes.\n\nFor instance, China can continue large-scale cyber intrusions as seen in recent attacks on U.S. telecommunications infrastructure, the Treasury Department, and key logistics hubs. Or Beijing can show Washington the limits of increased U.S. military pressure through technological signaling. It is timely that the same week the world saw pictures of China\u2019s sixth-generation fighter jets, additional videos emerged online of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) training with first-person view drones, similar to those used extensively in Ukraine.\n\nThe risks are manageable. With China\u2019s economy stagnating and its population in decline, the Trump administration needs to avoid pressing leaders in Beijing further into a frame in which risk-acceptant behavior seems rational. Pushing a desperate actor into a corner is a high-risk gamble. That actor will either back down or lash out. Yes, the United States should stand up to China, but it should do so clearly and balanced by multiple levels of crisis diplomacy and engagement.\n\nThe opportunity is clear. By revealing a new fighter jet\u2014that still only replicates proven U.S. capability\u2014Chinese President Xi Jinping has shown his hand. Economic threats are more likely to affect decision-making in Beijing than military threats. As the new Trump team takes office, they need a comprehensive China strategy that overcomes bureaucratic divides in the existing U.S. national security enterprise. Rather than directly responding to each military signal, the Trump team should take a more indirect approach, combining economics and law enforcement activities with efforts to help U.S. forces and allied militaries coordinate effectively, as well as establishing a framework for crisis management.\n\nFirst, the new Trump administration should prioritize developing a comprehensive interagency plan for countering the CCP that treats military power, while critical, as a supporting instrument of power rather than the primary. Drawing on this framework, the administration should introduce new economic and law enforcement instruments that target China\u2019s critical vulnerabilities.\n\nFrom a military standpoint, force posture and partner integration likely matter more than trying to gain an edge through advanced military technology. The Trump team will need to reassure partners and allies while building deeper interoperability to ensure U.S. forces can fight alongside democratic states in the Indo-Pacific. Strategy should focus on operational logistics, passing intelligence and targeting data between allies, and building up inventories of key munitions like air-to-air and anti-ship missiles. Force posture and partner integration are as important as fielding sophisticated military technology.\n\nSecond, the Trump administration must establish a deliberate and structured system for crisis management and diplomatic communication. To reduce the risk of unintended escalation, Washington should prioritize developing robust communication channels with Beijing. Regular military-to-military dialogues and crisis diplomacy mechanisms are essential to preventing misunderstandings and creating opportunities to de-escalate potential flashpoints, such as in the Taiwan Strait. This dual-track approach\u2014balancing deterrence with diplomacy\u2014is critical for responsibly managing great- ower competition as crises between the United States and China become more likely, not less.\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration should incorporate crisis rehearsals into its strategic planning, mirroring the war plans and mission rehearsal exercises used by the military. Such drills would expose vulnerabilities in the national security enterprise\u2019s operational approach and enhance readiness. Combining proactive crisis communication with strategic exercises will be key to weathering the challenges ahead.\n\nThird, the Trump team will need to ensure there are significant denial and defensive measures that support any new counter-China strategy. These measures should raise the costs of China\u2019s brazen use of cyber operations and economic espionage campaigns, as outlined in the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission\u2019s concept of layered deterrence. They could include hardening targets against advanced campaigns like Salt Typhoon and better intelligence sharing with the private sector to identify future threats.\n\nBy recognizing this moment as both a warning and an opportunity, Washington can remain competitive without inadvertently pushing Beijing into a dangerous escalation spiral. This point is especially salient given that PLA planners and ideologues think they can control a crisis. That belief is not backed up by history.\n\nYasir Atalan, a data fellow in the Futures Lab at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, contributed to this article.",

            "text": "The social media app, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been under attack for the past five years by U.S. politicians who see it as a potent threat to the country\u2019s national security.\n\nIn the United States, presidents come and go, but\u2014at least so far\u2014TikTok has endured.\n\nIn the United States, presidents come and go, but\u2014at least so far\u2014TikTok has endured.\n\nThe social media app, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been under attack for the past five years by U.S. politicians who see it as a potent threat to the country\u2019s national security.\n\nThose politicians may finally be about to get their big win. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to uphold a law signed by President Joe Biden last April that mandated that ByteDance sell TikTok within 270 days or face a ban in the United States. According to that timeline, TikTok\u2019s clock runs out on Sunday, Jan. 19\u2014the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office for the second time.\n\nTrump, who promised on the campaign trail that he would \u201csave\u201d TikTok, may be the best bet for the platform and its roughly 170 million American users. In late December, he filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to delay a ban until he takes office so he can \u201cpursue a political resolution.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the court will heed that plea\u2014or TikTok\u2019s argument that a ban would infringe on Americans\u2019 free speech rights under the First Amendment\u2014and there are still many open questions about the popular platform\u2019s fate.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThough he has now emerged as TikTok\u2019s most likely savior, Trump was the one who first sought to ban the app during his first term over national security concerns regarding the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s access to data about the app\u2019s American users. That ban, imposed via executive order, was overturned by Biden in 2021 after multiple courts blocked Trump\u2019s order.\n\nEfforts to reach a compromise on TikTok\u2019s ability to continue operating in the United States started and sputtered several times during Biden\u2019s term. Those efforts included a multiyear review by the Treasury Department\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and a TikTok-led initiative known as Project Texas, which would wall off the app\u2019s U.S. user data in a system run by American tech giant Oracle, which U.S. officials deemed insufficient to assuage their concerns.\n\nThose concerns continued to snowball even as TikTok added tens of millions of users in the United States\u2014including accounts for both leading presidential campaigns during the 2024 election season. But sustained pressure in Congress from China hawks on both sides of the aisle finally resulted in an overwhelming vote in favor of the new divest-or-ban measure, which was folded into a broader national security supplemental bill that Biden signed into law in April.\n\nThe congressional coalescence around a TikTok ban forced Biden\u2019s hand after months of negotiations, said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University. The Biden administration \u201csat on their hands, despite this supposedly very urgent national security threat to the country, as more and more people joined TikTok,\u201d Chander said. \u201cThey always had that authority; they just weren\u2019t willing to exercise it,\u201d he added.\n\nNow, TikTok finds itself turning back to Trump for a rescue. The platform\u2019s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, was among the many technology executives who visited the incoming president at Trump\u2019s country club, Mar-a-Lago, last month following the election, and Chew is reportedly planning to attend the inauguration on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is for the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional as applied to TikTok,\u201d said Chander, \u201cbut they [TikTok] would be happy if they get a delay \u2026 which would allow President Trump to weigh in with potentially a different national security assessment.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBarring a decisive intervention from the Supreme Court either way, TikTok will be illegal in the United States starting Sunday. The law states that no U.S. entity can \u201cdistribute, maintain, or update\u201d the app, which means that app stores that make TikTok available for download\u2014such as those run by Apple and Google\u2014or internet providers that enable access to it would be in violation.\n\nThose who already have TikTok on their phones could theoretically continue to access it, but the company reportedly plans to take its platform completely offline on Sunday once the ban goes into effect. According to a report by the Information citing sources familiar with the matter, Americans who try to access TikTok will instead be redirected to a website with information about the ban. A TikTok spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Foreign Policy.\n\nAs the law states, however, those eventualities could either be precluded (in the next three days) or reversed (anytime after Jan. 19) in the event that ByteDance agrees to sell TikTok.\n\nWho might buy it?\n\nAs with most other aspects of the TikTok ban, we\u2019ve been here before. In his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal to divest TikTok of its Chinese ownership, and a group jointly led by tech firm Oracle and retailer Walmart even agreed to purchase the platform. But that deal was shelved after Biden took office in 2021.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, who served as the U.S. treasury secretary during Trump\u2019s first administration, expressed interest last year in putting together an investor group to buy TikTok.\n\nMultiple reports this week suggest that officials in China\u2014which has consistently said it would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d a sale of TikTok\u2014may be coming around to billionaire Elon Musk as a potential buyer. Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has developed close ties to both China and Trump.\n\nThe most comprehensive and concrete bid, however, has come from billionaire Frank McCourt. McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, established an initiative in 2021 called Project Liberty, which aims to create a decentralized version of the internet where users have control over their individual data.\n\n\u201cWe think that that\u2019s the next era of the internet, and that\u2019s going to happen with or without a purchase of TikTok,\u201d McCourt said in an interview with Foreign Policy this week. \u201cWe just think that buying U.S. TikTok would accelerate things and compress time, so to speak, so that this alternative upgraded internet would have scale\u2014and therefore relevance\u2014sooner,\u201d he added.\n\nProject Liberty has put together a consortium of investors that is calling itself the People\u2019s Bid for TikTok. The consortium made a formal proposal to ByteDance last week, which McCourt said the Chinese firm has acknowledged receiving but hasn\u2019t otherwise responded to. McCourt declined to comment on how much the consortium has offered, but he has previously said that he has secured commitments of about $20 billion to purchase the platform.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the consortium is willing to purchase TikTok without the algorithm that powers its video recommendation engine\u2014an algorithm that China has placed restrictions on the sale of.\n\n\u201cAs a business person, I always look for solutions where everybody is winning a little something,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve come forward with seems to me to address all the stakeholders and is something in it for them: With President-elect Trump, it\u2019s avoiding a ban; with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping], it\u2019s addressing his concerns about the algorithm and Chinese intellectual property; with the investors, it\u2019s being able to get a return on investment as opposed to having it wiped out if the app is just shut down; for American citizens, it\u2019s protecting them from no longer being surveilled by a foreign adversary; and for TikTok users, the app stays lit up.\u201d\n\nHow will China react?\n\nBeyond its vocal opposition to a forced sale of TikTok and its restrictions on the sale of the app\u2019s algorithms, the Chinese government has largely distanced itself from the debate around the app\u2014at least publicly.\n\nBut to some experts, the U.S. crusade against TikTok has played right into Beijing\u2019s hands, geopolitically speaking.\n\n\u201cMy heterodox view is that China would be happy to see TikTok banned in the United States. It doesn\u2019t care about TikTok\u2019s future in the United States,\u201d said Chander, the Georgetown University professor. He added, \u201cInstead, it cares that this is yet another demonstration that U.S. professions of embracing free expression, liberalism, and speech across frontiers are really self-interested and not ultimately reliable.\u201d\n\nThe underlying problem may lie more on the U.S. domestic front, according to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. In the absence of meaningful privacy regulations, Chinese spies have many more avenues to gain access to data about American citizens, such as buying it from data brokers.\n\nPrivacy regulations \u201care the things that will actually solve the problem that this TikTok issue is trying to solve, and at the same time will avoid the kind of hit to reputation that America is taking on the global stage by pursuing this ban when it claims to champion an open and free and interoperable internet,\u201d Thibaut said. \u201cFraming the risk of Americans\u2019 data security as a problem that can be solved by banning TikTok leaves a wider and arguably more consequential swath of American data unprotected and available for purchase.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s commitment to free speech faces a more immediate test no matter what happens to TikTok\u2014as a ban looms, the most downloaded app among leading app stores in the United States this week was another Chinese social media app called Xiaohongshu, which means \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d but uses \u201cRedNote\u201d as its English name.\n\nThe app, which has an interface similar to TikTok\u2019s, has been flooded with thousands of new American users calling themselves \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d and has become a rare space for American and Chinese netizens to interact. While that camaraderie is unlikely to last long, given China\u2019s strict controls over its own internet apps, RedNote\u2019s surge in popularity lays bare the potential downside of Washington\u2019s elevation of TikTok as public enemy No. 1 and the precedent a TikTok ban might set for online speech and U.S.-China tech competition. (This week\u2019s second-most downloaded app was Lemon8, another video platform owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching this Xiaohongshu thing, and it just really epitomizes the futility of this whack-a-mole approach\u201d by Washington toward Chinese tech, Thibaut said. \u201cIt\u2019s been like the delight of Chinese state media right now\u2014it\u2019s been such a propaganda boon for them to talk about on their platforms.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Thibaut argues that China may have also backed itself into a corner with its rhetoric around TikTok, regardless of any back-channeling or dealmaking that Trump or Musk might be amenable to.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of tied their hands a bit\u2014the Chinese public would excoriate them if they ended up selling TikTok, one of the biggest examples of Chinese companies being world leaders in tech,\u201d she said. \u201cWould they sell TikTok as a way to avoid tariffs? That would be seen as a huge capitulation by their own setup \u2026 that would be a hard sell to the Chinese public.\u201d",
