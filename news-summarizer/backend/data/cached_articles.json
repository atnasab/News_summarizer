            "text": "After millions of Los Angeles County residents received evacuation alerts by mistake, countless Angelenos received more erroneous warnings while the county tries to improve its alert system.\n\n\u201cThere is a technical glitch, and we apologize for the confusion and anxiety that any of this has for anybody in the public,\u201d said Bryan LaSota, emergency management coordinator for Los Angeles County\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.\n\nThe errant warnings fueled panic and frustration in the nation\u2019s most populous county, where several wildfires still rage out of control. But authorities say the county\u2019s emergency alerts have also saved countless lives, giving residents time to flee before flames engulf their homes.\n\nWhile authorities cite unspecified technical flaws for this week\u2019s messaging problems, a larger issue remains.\n\nSome residents get emergency alerts on their phones based on their proximity to cell phone towers in those affected areas \u2013 not based on where they live. In other words: If your home is at risk of burning down, but you\u2019re at work on the other side of town, you might not get a cell phone alert saying your home is under an evacuation warning.\n\nThe two-day messaging debacle started Thursday, shortly after the Kenneth Fire broke out. Emergency officials tried to send an alert only to people in the Calabasas and Agoura Hills areas, LaSota told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe first technical glitch is that it went out county-wide, instead of to the affected area,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, residents throughout the county of almost 10 million people received an urgent message on their cell phones.\n\nAfter the error was discovered \u201cWe had to cancel that one,\u201d LaSota said.\n\nBut the problems continued Friday when residents were startled by pre-dawn alerts.\n\nNo one should have received such warnings before dawn Friday, LaSota said.\n\n\u201cDue to an error in the technology \u2026 people are receiving them today, even though they were sent yesterday,\u201d he said.\n\nLaSota and other emergency officials said a detailed investigation is underway to try to determine the cause.\n\nFriday evening, Los Angeles County said it was temporarily moving to the state\u2019s emergency notification system.",

            "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said forces operating in the Kursk region of Russia have captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured alive soldiers from the isolated state.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers have captured North Korean military personnel in the Kursk region. Two soldiers, though wounded, survived and were transported to Kyiv, where they are now communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said Saturday in a statement on X, which included several images of the injured soldiers.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year.\n\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the last week of December.\n\nZelensky said of the two Korean soldiers who had been captured: \u201cThis was not an easy task: Russian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea\u2019s involvement in the war against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nA video and still photograph show a Russian military ID which Ukraine claims was carried by a North Korean soldier taken captive by Ukrainian forces. CNN has blurred the name and date of birth on the ID. Security Service of Ukraine\n\nSoldiers in bunk beds\n\nThe Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, released video purportedly showing the soldiers.\n\nIn the video, the SBU spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers.\n\n\u201cThey are being held in appropriate conditions that meet the requirements of international law,\u201d the SBU said.\n\nThe video shows the two soldiers in bunk beds in a cell. One has a wound to his jaw. Neither is heard speaking. An unidentified doctor says that the second soldier has a fractured leg.\n\nThe SBU spokesman said that \u201ccommunication with them is carried out through interpreters of Korean,\u201d in cooperation with South Korean intelligence services.\n\nSaturday\u2019s capture is the first time that Ukraine has caught North Korean soldiers alive from the battlefield.\n\nThe SBU released images of a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person from Tuva in Russia, which it said was being carried by one of the captured soldiers. According to the SBU, the soldier said he had been issued the document in Russia last autumn. He also said that some of North Korea\u2019s combat units had just one week of training with Russian troops. The other captive had no documents, the SBU said.\n\nThe soldier said he had been in the North Korean military and had thought he was being sent to Russia for training rather than combat, according to the SBU\u2019s account.\n\nIt comes as Ukraine on Sunday renewed its offensive on Kursk, where its troops have been holding territory after last summer\u2019s shock incursion.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said on Tuesday that it had conducted a precision strike on a Russian military command post near the town of Belaya.\n\nAlthough Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly advanced through Kursk in the summer \u2013 in the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II \u2013 Russia eventually managed to push the forces back. The lines had been mostly static for weeks before Ukraine\u2019s latest push.\n\nIn his daily address on Monday, Zelensky said the Kursk offensive was important in preventing Russia from redirecting its troops to Donetsk and other regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nDespite both sides being drained after nearly three years of war, frontline fighting has ramped up in recent weeks. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House this month \u2013 promising to end the war in a day, without saying how \u2013 Moscow and Kyiv appear to be making an 11th-hour push to gobble up territory and strengthen their negotiating hands ahead of potential peace talks.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nViolent protests have erupted in China after the death of a teenage boy sparked accusations of a cover-up by authorities, videos from the northwestern region of Shaanxi have shown.\n\nIn videos verified by CNN, dozens of protesters are seen confronting a wall of riot police outside the Pucheng Vocational Technical School, with some hurling batons and other objects towards the officers.\n\nOne of the protesters was seen hurling a fire extinguisher at a door, shattering its glass. In response, police are seen aggressively handling the demonstrators, beating some and throwing others to the ground.\n\nThe trigger for the protests was the death of a teenage student, whose surname was Dang and who was in his third year at the school. Local authorities in Pucheng have claimed Dang\u2019s death on January 2 was an accident and not criminal, but allegations have swirled on social media that there has been a cover-up.\n\nChinese authorities have been particularly wary of public protests in the country following the widespread \u201cWhite Paper\u201d demonstrations in late 2022 against Beijing\u2019s hardline policies during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nVideos showed violent clashes between police and protesters outside the school. Social media\n\nAccording to a statement from investigators posted on the Pucheng county government\u2019s website, Dang \u201chad a verbal and physical altercation\u201d with a first-year student surnamed Guo over \u201cdisturbing his rest\u201d in his dormitory. That night, a school official helped resolve the argument.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., another student in Dang\u2019s dormitory went to the restroom, where he found a wooden stool underneath the balcony window, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThe sliding window was open, and the metal mesh screen has been removed. Dang had already fallen from the window to the ground below,\u201d it said.\n\nHuman Rights In China, a US-based activist group, reported \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d leading to Dang\u2019s death, including witness reports of \u201csigns of a struggle in Dang\u2019s dormitory\u201d and the suggestion that he was \u201cpushed from the roof.\u201d\n\nThe group said Dang\u2019s family has rejected the official explanation of his death. The family also claimed that photos from his cell phone had been deleted, Reuters reported. The family\u2019s skepticism has been amplified widely on social media.\n\nIt is unclear whether the protests, which began Monday, continued throughout the week.\n\nCalls by CNN to the public security bureau of Pucheng county, as well as that of Weinan city \u2013 which the county is part of \u2013 went unanswered.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFour lynx \u201cillegally released\u201d into the Scottish Highlands have been captured by park rangers in a rollercoaster two-day rescue effort.\n\nThe search began on Wednesday afternoon when two lynx were spotted in the Cairngorms National Park, one of the last truly wild places remaining in the UK. The animals were captured the following day, lured with bait into humane traps.\n\nTwo additional lynx, which appeared to have been \u201cdeliberately abandoned,\u201d were later spotted on camera traps Thursday night in the same region, according to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).\n\nOne of the lynx has since died, RZSS told CNN Saturday.\n\nThe 48-hour rescue effort was initially declared a victory by conservation groups, but the discovery of the medium-sized cats \u2013 which once roamed free in Scotland \u2013 has sparked fears that some might be taking rewildling into their own hands.\n\nLynx tend to ignore humans and don\u2019t generally pose a threat, according to wildlife experts. Some conservationists have called for the lynx to be released back into the Scottish Highlands, but reintroducing the lost species has long been a thorny issue.\n\nDavid Field, chief executive of RZSS, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program that there are \u201crogue rewilders out there\u201d who ignore international best practice with regard to the reintroduction of species.\n\n\u201cThey are impatient and then proceed in a way which is this rebellious rogue rewilding. That\u2019s really sad and that\u2019s a real, real risk,\u201d he said.\n\nConservationists have condemned the release, saying that the animals -- photographed in Scotland -- would be unlikely to survive in the wild. Royal Zoological Society of Scotland\n\nEdward Mountain, Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said the second lynx capture \u201cwould suggest a concerted approach to illegally reintroduce lynx,\u201d according to PA Media.\n\nPolice Scotland and rangers from the Cairngorms National Park Authority joined the mammoth rescue effort and inquiries are being made into how the animals ended up roaming free in the park.\n\nThe second pair of cats were captured at around 6:30 p.m. local time on January 10 within the Kingussie region of the park and taken to the nearby Highland Wildlife Park to be assessed by vets, RZSS said.\n\nThe cats will be moved into quarantine for 30 days at Edinburgh Zoo, RZSS added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster 48 hours, with people working throughout the day and night, in some extremely challenging conditions,\u201d Dr Helen Senn, RZSS Head of Conservation said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nSenn added that they don\u2019t think there are any more lynx in the park but will continue to monitor the release site.\n\nHighland Wildlife Park said in a statement on Facebook that they \u201ccondemn the illegal release of these lynx in the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very unlikely they would have survived in the wild,\u201d the park added.",

            "title": "Australian Open: With an old rival at his side, Novak Djokovic resumes his quest for a 25th grand slam title",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nNovak Djokovic and Andy Murray faced each other 36 times throughout their tennis careers, mostly in finals and often at the sharp end of grand slam tournaments. But at this year\u2019s Australian Open, their decades-long rivalry has taken an unexpected turn.\n\nIn his ongoing pursuit of a record-breaking 25th major title, Djokovic has enlisted Murray, recently retired but not prepared to walk away from tennis entirely, as part of his coaching team.\n\nIt was an arresting sight for tennis fans when the pair first appeared in Melbourne together this week, Djokovic striking balls in practice and Murray looking on with hawk-like attention. But might this unusual player-coach partnership make sense?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in search of perfection that Novak Djokovic, I think, hires Andy Murray,\u201d seven-time grand slam champion and Eurosport expert Mats Wilander told CNN Sport.\n\n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t think that he\u2019s going to be five percent better because of Andy Murray \u2026 We\u2019re talking about one or two points here and there,\u201d Wilander added. \u201cMurray might have some valuable information that Novak hasn\u2019t thought about before, and that could be the difference between him winning his 25th grand slam title or not.\u201d\n\nCurrently tied with Australian Margaret Court at the top of the all-time list, Djokovic was expected to become tennis\u2019 outright grand slam singles leader with one more title last year. But despite adding an Olympic gold medal to his trophy cabinet, he went the whole season without winning a major crown for the first time since 2017, falling short against Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.\n\nAt the upcoming Australian Open, a tournament he has won a record 10 times before, Djokovic resumes his quest for tennis history.\n\nFour months out from his 38th birthday, he would comfortably be the oldest grand slam singles champion in the Open era should he triumph in Melbourne, though we have seen many times how the Serbian star can bend and flex his body in ways that defy his advancing years.\n\nThese days, rather than play a full schedule, Djokovic tends to target a handful of tournaments in order to preserve his fitness and prolong his career. Such an approach means that his ranking has suffered, and he enters the Australian Open as the seventh seed with a tricky draw in front of him.\n\nFour-time grand slam champion Alcaraz could be Djokovic\u2019s opponent as soon as the quarterfinal, perhaps the latest instalment in what has become an intriguing rivalry.\n\n\u201cHe needs a bit of luck,\u201d Sa\u0161a Ozmo, a journalist for Sportklub who has covered Djokovic\u2019s career extensively, told CNN Sport prior to the draw. \u201cBut I think if it can open just a bit for him and if he can get into the groove, slowly but surely, I\u2019d say he\u2019s among the favorites. Not the top favorite, but among the favorites.\u201d\n\nJannik Sinner, the world No. 1 and defending Australian Open champion, enters the men\u2019s draw as the player to beat. He won his first grand slam title in Melbourne last year, then ended 2024 with victories at the US Open and the ATP Finals to cement his place at the top of the rankings.\n\nAlcaraz, meanwhile, could become the youngest player to achieve a career grand slam \u2013 needing only the Australian Open to complete a sweep of the majors four months before his 22nd birthday \u2013 and second seed Alexander Zverev continues to chase a first grand slam title after a strong season last year.\n\nAlcaraz is looking to complete a career grand slam. Graham Denholm/Getty Images\n\nSinner is defending his Australian Open title. William West/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut no one will be discounting Djokovic from triumphing once more at his favored event, even after he was surprisingly beaten in straight sets by Reilly Opelka at the Brisbane International last week.\n\nIn former world No. 1 and three-time grand slam champion Murray, he not only has a coach who is familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the world\u2019s top players, but also a friend and rival helping him to raise his game.\n\n\u201cI think that motivation is a big thing,\u201d veteran coach Brad Gilbert told CNN\u2019s Don Riddell earlier this week. \u201cHaving that motivation to want to go to practice and want to work hard for somebody, that will help. And I think that\u2019s one thing that Andy can provide.\u201d\n\nDjokovic himself has said how he \u201ccaught (Murray) a little bit off guard\u201d with the coaching offer, but remains confident that the unlikely collaboration will bear fruit.\n\n\u201cBeing on the same side of the net is actually great for a change,\u201d he explained last month. \u201cHe\u2019s been one of my greatest rivals and, in a way, it was strange for me to share all these insights about how I feel on the court, sharing some of the secrets of what I\u2019m going through, what I\u2019m thinking about, how I see my game with somebody that has been always one of the top rivals.\n\n\u201cHe has a unique perspective on my game as one of the greatest rivals that I\u2019ve had. He knows the pros and cons of my game and he has also played up to recently on the tour, so he knows all the other best players currently in the world \u2013 the youngsters and their weaknesses and strengths in their games. I look forward to it, I really do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a surreal twist of fate to see Murray and Djokovic hitting together on practice courts at the Australian Open, 14 years after they first faced each other in a major final at the same tournament.\n\nIt was Djokovic who triumphed on that occasion, claiming his second grand slam crown in Melbourne. Few could have predicted what would follow: eight further Australian Open titles, a record 428 weeks at the top of the rankings, and a career like none we have seen before.\n\nMurray and Djokovic embrace after the 2011 Australian Open final. Robert Prezioso/Getty Images/File\n\nIn virtually every category for men\u2019s tennis \u2013 grand slams, Masters titles, time spent as world No. 1 \u2013 Djokovic is unmatched. With nothing left to prove, he still feels compelled to accomplish more, to extend further the boundaries of what it is possible to achieve in a single career.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really see what the 25th title would change,\u201d said Ozmo, adding: \u201cFor me, undoubtedly, he\u2019s the greatest of all time. I think even people who used to say, \u2018It\u2019s a fight, it\u2019s close\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re giving up too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just making up goals now and he\u2019s setting up new goals just to try to keep himself motivated.\u201d\n\nFor Wilander, the debate about the greatest of all time is purely a matter of taste and semantics; but when it boils down to results \u2013 the player who has achieved the most on the court \u2013 in his mind there is no debate left to be had.\n\n\u201cThe greatest could be Roger Federer, it could be Bj\u00f6rn Borg, it could be anyone, but the best of all time is Novak Djokovic, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Wilander. \u201cThere is no question in anybody\u2019s mind that he is the best ever.\u201d\n\nThe next two weeks in Melbourne are another opportunity to find out what this extraordinary athlete can still achieve.",

It then flies west over the Andes to Santiago, the Chilean capital, which sits in a valley surrounded by the snowy Andean peaks and the Chilean Coastal Range.\n\nLast year is now officially the hottest year on record, with scientific analyses saying that is playing a role in recent extreme weather events, with the LA wildfires being the latest example. (Find out here how you can help residents affected by the unprecedented fires).\n\nRising temperatures might also contribute to an increase in severe \u201cclear air\u201d turbulence, which strikes fast and offers no visual cues. While incidents are predicted to rise, experts say it doesn\u2019t mean flying will be less safe.\n\nPeople and planes\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of travel-based misbehavior this month already, with a JetBlue passenger arrested for opening the emergency exit door on a plane, a man caught with a crocodile skull in his luggage in Delhi and a woman stopped in Germany with 90 kilos (nearly 200 pounds) of luxury chocolate from Dubai.

In December, a United Airlines pilot raced through a Texas airport to surprise an old friend: the woman who saved his life.\n\nAnd in October, a Delta Air Lines crew \u2013 and a plane full of well-wishing passengers \u2013 helped reunite a mother and daughter for a precious final goodbye. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt wasn\u2019t one person who did one huge thing, it was a lot of people doing a really nice thing,\u201d says daughter Hannah White.\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nPlenty of idyllically located Italian villages with aging populations have been making headlines in recent years, most often for the boom in one-euro homes.\n\nNow a little town in the southern region of Calabria has taken the unusual step of banning its residents from falling ill. It\u2019s home to a beautiful hilltop castle, but its mayor says its health-care facilities are less of an attraction.\n\nBecoming sick at sea is another hazard few think about in advance. CNN Travel took a look at the life of a cruise ship doctor, from heart attacks to dealing with death.\n\nIn Germany, doctors can prescribe four-week spa breaks to frazzled parents.

            "title": "Some California residents get extra protection from wildfires \u2013 for a price",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs the Palisades fire began intensifying Tuesday evening, Los Angeles real estate executive Keith Wasserman sent out a plea on social media: \u201cDoes anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home in Pacific Palisades? Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount.\u201d\n\nThe now-deleted post sparked an intense blowback by social media users who felt the wealthy shouldn\u2019t be given special attention during an emergency.\n\n\u201cWhose home gets saved shouldn\u2019t depend on their bank account,\u201d one TikTok user commented.\n\nAs multiple wildfires, powered by high-speed winds, have destroyed thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area, some residents have gone to great lengths \u2014 and often great expense \u2014 to try to shield their homes from destruction. Some have paid thousands of dollars to get their properties sprayed with fire-retardant gels to stem the damage, while others have invested in personal fire hydrants to help fight fires near their property.\n\nDespite the intense reaction to Wasserman\u2019s social media post, most private firefighters aren\u2019t hired by wealthy individuals, Mike Stutts, a firefighter in Somerset, California, told CNN. Instead, most work with home insurance companies that are trying to save expensive homes to avoid costly insurance payouts.\n\nAccording to materials on its website, insurance company Chubb offers \u201cWildfire Defense Services\u201d to eligible clients. During a wildfire event, those services include \u201csending certified professional firefighters to your home,\u201d \u201cremoving combustible materials from around your home\u201d and \u201cspraying your home with a heat-absorbing fire-blocking gel.\u201d\n\nTim Bauer, a senior vice president at fire damage restoration service Allied Disaster Defense, said after the first three days of fire in Pacific Palisades, he had a waiting list of at least 200 people, all desperate for the company\u2019s services. Bauer said the company is spraying properties with the same fire retardant dropped by firefighting air tankers.\n\nAllied sprays down bushes, shrubs and other vegetation to prevent ashes and sparks from igniting a home.\n\nDuring non-emergency times, the cost is about $1,000, but amid dangerous wildfire conditions, Bauer charges $5,000.\n\nFor many in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, it\u2019s a small price to pay to help protect multimillion-dollar homes. Bauer said one woman offered $100,000 to be moved to the top of his waiting list, but Bauer said he planned to stick to the original order on his list.\n\nOn Friday, Michael Owens, a real estate developer in the Los Angeles area, showed one of his newly built homes to a family whose own home was just destroyed in the Palisades fire.\n\nThe listed price of the home in Westlake Village, which sits on the Los Angeles-Ventura county line, is nearly $15 million. One of the home\u2019s main selling points is it\u2019s built with fire-proof materials and comes equipped with a personal fire hydrant.\n\nAll in, the cost of the home\u2019s personal fire hydrant is about $100,000, Owens told CNN. That includes the installation cost and a one-time $35,000 fee to the municipal water company for access. Owens said he has one in front of his own Westlake Village home, as well.\n\nOwens said he hoped the recent wildfires would convince more people to prioritize investing in fire-safe homes.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting now, as you see homes built back in the Palisades, what people consider doing with their homes when they\u2019re in an urban high-fire risk area,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Malibu, a type of personal fire hydrant that costs significantly less than $100,000 has grown in popularity, said Kevin Rosenbloom, a local resident who owns a healthcare device company.\n\nRosenbloom\u2019s home was rebuilt after it was destroyed by a wildfire in 2007. In front of his home, he built a \u201cHainy Hydrant,\u201d a personal fire hydrant developed by fellow Malibu resident Matt Haines to help the area combat wildfires.\n\nRosenbloom said the hydrant cost him about $2,500, and since it taps into a home\u2019s personal water supply, it can be installed by a plumber. Rosenbloom said his home hasn\u2019t been hit by the recent fires, but he plans to use his personal hydrant to keep his home \u201ccool and wet\u201d if one approaches.\n\n\u201cPeople all over Malibu have been putting these hydrants in. It\u2019s a basic first step and it\u2019s very inexpensive relative to other systems available,\u201d Rosenbloom said. \u201cThis is really the next technology in fire suppression and fire protection.\u201d\n\nEven with extra investment in firefighting and suppression systems, though, there is no guarantee a home could survive a fire as strong as the one still raging in Pacific Palisades.\n\nWasserman, who sent out the plea for private firefighters, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAn amputee and his son with cerebral palsy were among the 16 deaths in the fires raging around Los Angeles. The father was found at his son\u2019s bedside.\n\nOne victim told a relative that he did not want to evacuate. He died trying to fight the blaze that consumed his home of more than 50 years.\n\nAnother victim, an 85-year-old woman, refused to leave her home as the fast-moving Palisades Fire approached, preferring instead to stay behind with her beloved pets. A former child star from Australia also was among those who died, as well as a Malibu resident and surfer who was called a \u201cmagnet for people.\u201d\n\nFive of the 11 deaths appear related to the Palisades Fire near the Southern California coast, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Another six deaths have been attributed to the Eaton Fire, which raged east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe complete death toll won\u2019t be clear until it\u2019s safe for investigators to enter neighborhoods where there are downed power lines, gas leaks and other hazards, according to authorities.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the victims:\n\nAnnette Rossilli\n\nAnnette Rossilli Luxe Homecare\n\nAnnette Rossilli, 85, insisted on staying in her Pacific Palisades home with her dog Greetly, her canary Pepper, her two parrots and her turtle, according to Luxe Homecare, the company that provided in-home care for her three days a week.\n\nThe Palisades Fire, the largest of several blazes, started Tuesday morning. Rossilli was encouraged to leave on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA caregiver later offered to pick Rossilli up even though it was her day off, Fay Vahdani, Luxe Homecare president, said Friday. Neighbors tried to convince her to evacuate but Rossilli refused to leave.\n\nOn Wednesday, firefighters found Rossilli\u2019s body in her car, according to Vahdani and relatives of the victim.\n\nRossilli is survived by a daughter and a son. She ran a plumbing business in Pacific Palisades for many years with her late husband. She continued to live in the same home after his passing.\n\nShe was a kind, friendly and grateful person who had many friends in the community and will be deeply missed, according to Luxe Homecare.\n\nAnthony and Justin Mitchell\n\nAnthony Mitchell, an amputee who used a wheelchair, last spoke to his daughter, Hajime White, who lives in Arkansas, on Wednesday morning, she told the Washington Post.\n\nHe told his daughter he planned to evacuate his home in Altadena, a neighborhood north of Pasadena, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nMitchell and his adult son Justin, who had cerebral palsy, lived together, White told the newspaper.\n\nThey never evacuated: White said authorities told her Mitchell\u2019s body was found by the bed of his son.\n\n\u201cHe was not going to leave his son behind. No matter what,\u201d White told the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s like a ton of bricks just fell on me.\u201d\n\nErliene Kelley\n\nErliene Kelley Family photo\n\nErliene Kelley chose not to evacuate on Tuesday night with her granddaughter and her family. She wanted to stay in the Altadena home where she\u2019d lived for more than 40 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands,\u201d Kelley told family members, according to her granddaughter, Briana Navarro.\n\nNavarro wrote in a GoFundMe post that the family was notified on Friday that Kelley had perished in the Eaton Fire.\n\n\u201cWe made the choice to evacuate on Tuesday night, however my grandmother decided she wanted to stay,\u201d wrote Navarro. She later asked her father to check on Kelley, who again refused to evacuate.\n\nNavarro\u2019s father returned to the house on Wednesday and found it had been destroyed in the fire.\n\nNavarro, her husband and their two children lived with Kelley. They lost everything in the fire, according to the post.\n\nVictor Shaw\n\nVictor Shaw Family photo via KTLA\n\nVictor Shaw, 66, decided to try to fight the raging Eaton blaze with a garden hose this week rather than evacuate his longtime family home, according to KTLA.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner has confirmed his death, noting that died at his home from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.\n\nShaw lived with his younger sister, Shari Shaw, who told KTLA the intensity of the approaching fire forced her to evacuate Tuesday night but that her brother insisted on staying.\n\nRodney Nickerson\n\nRodney Nickerson Eric Nickerson\n\nIn one of his final phone calls, as the Eaton Fire approached his Altadena home, Rodney Nickerson said, \u201cSon, the winds are picking up really, really bad.\u201d\n\nThe son, Eric Nickerson, remembers every word of that last conversation with his father. They were extremely close and spoke every day.\n\n\u201cIt was a normal conversation. Like most mornings,\u201d Eric Nickerson told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Friday.\n\nThe younger Nickerson recalled not being able to reach his father later that Tuesday, nor the following morning.\n\nAfter other family members and friends learned of Rodney\u2019s death, they struggled to break the news to his son.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to tell me,\u201d Eric Nickerson said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really know what words to tell me because of the situation.\u201d\n\nThe close-knit, working class neighborhood where Rodney Nickerson lived for more than 50 years \u2013 and where his son grew up \u2013 has been virtually destroyed by fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastated,\u201d Eric Nickerson lamented. \u201cIt looks like a movie set.\u201d\n\nRory Callum Sykes\n\nRory Callum Sykes was killed in the California wildfires, according to his mother Shelley Sykes. From Shelley Sykes/X\n\nA former child star from Australia died when the Los Angeles wildfires ripped through his family\u2019s Malibu estate in California earlier this week, according to his mother.\n\nRory Callum Sykes was at the family\u2019s 17-acre Mount Malibu TV Studios estate, where he had his own cottage, when it burned down during the Palisades Fire on January 8, his mother Shelley Sykes wrote on X Thursday.\n\nShelley Sykes described her son, who appeared on the 1998 British TV series \u201cKiddy Kapers,\u201d as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d and said she was \u201ctotally heart broken\u201d by his death.\n\nShe said she had tried to put out the wildfire cinders on her property\u2019s roof using a hose but couldn\u2019t because the water wasn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018mom leave me\u2019 and no mom can leave their kid. And I\u2019ve got a broken arm, I couldn\u2019t lift him, I couldn\u2019t move him,\u201d Sykes told Australia\u2019s 10 News First.\n\nHer son, 32, was born blind with cerebral palsy and had become famous for his speeches on overcoming disability. He was the co-founder of Happy Charity, which according to its site offers, \u201cHope, Happiness & Health to those that are Hurting.\u201d\n\nOn his website, Sykes described himself as a professional speaker and consultant for many companies including the Tony Robbins Foundation and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance.\n\n\u201cHe overcame so much with surgeries and therapies to regain his sight and to be able to learn to walk. Despite the pain, he still enthused about traveling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica,\u201d Shelley Sykes wrote on X.\n\nRandall \u201cRandy\u201d Miod\n\nCarol Smith with son Randall Miod Carol Smith\n\nRandall \u201cRandy\u201d Miod, 55, died in the place he loved most: his home.\n\nThat\u2019s according to his mother, Carol Smith, who said Miod lived in the Malibu beach house for decades.\n\nDetectives found human remains in Miod\u2019s home, Smith said, telling CNN all his roommates have been accounted for.\n\n\u201c(His home) was his prized possession. That\u2019s the one and only house he ever owned,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe just felt so blessed to be able to live in Malibu. That was his dream come true because he\u2019d been surfing since he was a teenager.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 years ago, Miod rented a studio apartment attached to the house. After 13 years, the owner offered to sell the house for a discounted price \u2013 an opportunity Miod jumped on.\n\nFrom there, the house on Pacific Coast Highway became locally known as \u201cthe Crab Shack,\u201d Smith said. Miod had an open-door policy in which friends were constantly coming and going from the red barn-style home built in 1924, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was just kind of a magnet for people. And people just loved him and he loved people. He was a very kind person,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere was always a party, wherever Randy went, there was a party.\u201d\n\nMiod was determined to protect his beloved house.\n\nWhen they talked on the phone Tuesday, he told Smith he had a garden hose ready to go. She believed he didn\u2019t know how big the flames were going to get.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been through so many of these fires and made it through unscathed. I think he thought he could do it again,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m realizing how many memories he had in that home, I can understand why he didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nMiod, who lived in California all his life, spent most of the last few decades managing restaurants and surfing.\n\n\u201cHe used to cut class in high school to go surfing. I can remember one time I had to hide his surfboard,\u201d Smith laughed. \u201cI said, \u2018You are supposed to be in the school. You\u2019re not supposed to be at the beach.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said the last year was a tough one for Miod, as he lost his restaurant job, broke a finger and had to say goodbye to his cat of many years. However, Smith said he always kept a positive outlook on life and searched for the silver lining despite the hardship. He even recently picked up a new kitten.\n\n\u201cHe was unique\u2026 I\u2019ve never known another one like him,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

CNN is tracking the fires in maps and charts.\n\nThis map will automatically update as data becomes available.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection employs sensors attached to aircraft to capture fire perimeter data. Because high winds can sometimes ground aircraft, updates to the observed fire perimeter can be delayed.\n\nTrack the fire size and containment estimates on the fires currently burning throughout the state:\n\nCalifornia officials continue updating the areas impacted by evacuation orders and warnings.

            "title": "Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department effective Friday, according to a court filing.\n\nThe filing comes amid a legal fight to stop Attorney General Merrick Garland from releasing the special counsel\u2019s report of his investigations into then-President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the alleged mishandling of classified documents after Trump left office.\n\nSmith gave his final, two-volume report to the attorney general on Tuesday. Garland has indicated he would not release the part of the report regarding the classified documents investigation, but believes it should be public eventually.\n\nSmith\u2019s office has been in the wind-down process for weeks, and his resignation before Trump takes office isn\u2019t unexpected. In addition to finalizing its report and sending it to the attorney general, Smith\u2019s team had also handed off an ongoing appeal over the special counsel\u2019s office powers to other attorneys at the Department of Justice and dismissed the two federal criminal cases against Trump because of his return to the presidency.\n\nThe attorney general has also told congressional committee leaders he intends to give to them confidential access to Smith\u2019s volume on the classified documents case \u2014 making this weekend and next week a crucial window for AG Merrick Garland\u2019s intentions of transparency.\n\nIn the meantime, the Justice Department is battling in court with Trump and his former co-defendants over whether Smith\u2019s report can be made public, with the clock ticking down to the the January 20 inauguration. Trump is planning to appoint some members of his defense team, who have argued in court against publication, to high-level positions at the Justice Department.\n\nAn appeals court on Friday rejected a request from Trump and his allies to keep the report under wraps. The Justice Department has since appealed a temporary hold that Judge Aileen Cannon placed on the report\u2019s release, and the former defendants have asked her to extend that hold, which otherwise expires Sunday evening.\n\nAs the court fight stands now, the Justice Department may be able to release Smith\u2019s first volume to the public Sunday or Monday. Cannon, however, has asked for more information from the Justice Department by Sunday morning about what\u2019s in Volume 1 and whether any of it bears on the classified documents case.\n\nSmith was appointed by Garland to take over the documents and election subversion investigations in November 2022, after Trump announced his campaign for reelection. A former federal prosecutor, Smith had more recently served as a war crimes prosecutor at the Hague.\n\nHe brought charges against Trump in both investigations in 2023, but both prosecutions ran into legal setbacks, and with voters\u2019 decision to return Trump to the White House, the president-elect was dismissed from the cases.\n\nOne legacy from Smith\u2019s investigations is the sweeping presidential immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in the election subversion case, which set a very high bar for prosecuting a former president for his official acts in office.\n\nTrump and his allies on the Hill have publicly discussed investigations they intend to launch into the special counsel probes.\n\nThe report potentially acts as Smith\u2019s final word on what his investigations found, and their legal reasoning. The current court fight aside, there are other avenues by which the report might become public. Congress could take steps to obtain the report or information from it. There is also the possibility of Freedom of Information Acts requests, and litigation stemming from those requests, forcing the disclosure of details from the report.\n\nTrump\u2019s former co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos DeOliveira, are arguing that the report should not be shared with Congress or the public because it would be prejudicial in the event that the prosecution against them \u2014 dismissed by Judge Cannon on the grounds that Smith was unconstitutionally appointed \u2014 was revived by an appeals court.\n\nThe new filing from DOJ countered that argument by pointing to Garland\u2019s decision not to publicly release that report and by noting that the lawmakers that would be allowed to view it, under Garland\u2019s plan, would be prohibited from sharing details from it.\n\nTrump and his allies are also arguing that Cannon\u2019s ruling disqualifying Smith deprived him of the power to write the report and prevents Garland from releasing it.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

            "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nIn the wee hours of an October morning, dozens of dogs chased the hulking figure of an animal scrambling through a forest in northwestern China as a thermal drone whizzed overhead.\n\n\u201cThe dogs caught it! Just stab it! Stab it!\u201d a drone operator shouted into his walkie-talkie to the hunter, in a video report by a state-linked news outlet.\n\nThe hunter rushed to the spot where the dogs had cornered the 125-kilogram beast, and thrust his spear into it, killing the animal and securing a reward of 2,400 yuan ($330).\n\nHe works with one of six \u201cbounty hunting\u201d teams hired by Xiji county in China\u2019s northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region this fall.\n\nTheir prey? Wild boars.\n\nIn recent years, China has authorized teams of bounty hunters to kill wild boars as part of a pilot program to control a pest that\u2019s wreaking havoc on crops and causing accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. In February, the program was expanded to a nationwide cull.\n\nThe hunters are not allowed to use firearms or poison, but the cull has surprised the public in a country where wildlife protection is tightly regulated.\n\nAnimal protection groups have criticized the measure as experts debate whether the rise in wild boar attacks justifies killing large numbers of animals, and if hunting is the right solution to mitigate human-wildlife conflict in the world\u2019s second most populous country.\n\nWild boar attacks\n\nChina\u2019s problem with wild boars dates back over two decades, when people hunted so many of the animals to eat that they became extinct in some areas, according to the state broadcaster CGTN.\n\nIn response, the government added them to a national protection list in 2000, allowing licensed hunting only in areas where there were too many boars.\n\nOver time, almost free from natural predators, the animal\u2019s population surged from some 10,000 to about 2 million, and so did reports of wild boar attacks.\n\nBoars caused damage to property or people in all but eight of China\u2019s 34 provincial-level regions, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) said last January.\n\nIn Xiji county, where six official bounty hunting teams killed 300 wild boars this fall, the animals inflicted economic losses of over 2 million yuan ($276,200) in 2023 alone, mainly through tearing up farmland, a local official told The Paper, a state-run newspaper.\n\nA cornfield devastated by wild boars in central Henan province. @xiangru/Douyin\n\nPeople have also lost their lives.\n\nIn December 2023, a 51-year-old villager from central Hubei province died from blood loss after being bitten by a wild boar, The Paper reported. Three years earlier, a village official suffered a similar fatal boar attack in southwestern Sichuan province, according to the newspaper.\n\nBoars have also been seen in urban areas more frequently as their numbers rise and habitat shrinks from China\u2019s rapid urbanization.\n\nA wild boar bursts into a four-star hotel in eastern Nanjing city. @diyiqiumipangge/Weibo\n\nA wild boar burst into the lobby of a four-star hotel in Nanjing in late October, struggling to escape on the slick floor before security captured it, according to state media reports.\n\nTwo days earlier, another boar, weighing 80 kilograms, ran amok through a downtown street in eastern Hangzhou, overturning vehicles and rampaging in a local shop.\n\nA boar charges down a downtown street in eastern Hangzhou city. @pengpaichunqiu/Weibo\n\nIs \u201chunting\u201d the right solution?\n\nWild boar hunting\u2019s popularity plummeted after the species came under national protection, though some poachers still risked jail time to kill them for sale in wildlife markets.\n\nBut demand for boar meat slumped when Beijing imposed what it called an \u201cunprecedentedly strict\u201d ban on wildlife consumption in early 2020.\n\nAt the time, the coronavirus pandemic was spreading worldwide and many scientists linked it back to a food market in central China that sold wild meat.\n\nOne year after the consumption ban, reports of wild boar attacks exceeded 100 for the first time, according to a tally of human-boar conflicts from 2000 to 2021 published in Acta Geographica Sinica, a leading Chinese geographic journal.\n\nAs social and state media reports of wild boar attacks continued to mount, the central government removed the species from its national protection list in 2023, waiving the need for a license to hunt them.\n\nWhile many welcomed the policy shift to control the pest, recent high-profile bounty hunting initiatives by local authorities have faced some pushback, igniting debate among experts about how the country should tackle this growing public menace.\n\nA screengrab from thermal drone footage posted by a bounty hunting team in Ningxia, showing dogs cornering a boar, with a hunter (lower right) approaching. @Chengshilierenquanshe/Douyin\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to protect animals? Why are we back to hunting again?\u201d said a user on Douyin, TikTok\u2019s sister app in China.\n\nAn animal protection group active in fighting wildlife poaching for over a decade called the nationwide culling a \u201cbrutal farce,\u201d on China\u2019s X-like platform Weibo.\n\nOfficials have defended the policy. Sun Quanhui, a member of the Wild Boar Population Management Expert Group at China\u2019s top forestry administration, told the state-run China Daily that hunting was the \u201conly way\u201d to manage the wild boar population, given the absence of natural predators.\n\nYet, Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, a Beijing-based conservation organization, told CNN that hunting, as a form of human intervention, is only justifiable when the animal\u2019s population truly overwhelms the local ecology.\n\nAnd based on open data, he said, it was way too early to say the boars were \u201crunning rampant\u201d in China.\n\nHe added that wild boar attacks are \u201cprecisely a fallout of humans disrupting the natural balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn one hand, we\u2019ve driven their natural predators, like tigers, to the brink of extinction. On the other, while we\u2019re becoming more aware of the need for conservation, many of our efforts are one-sided.\u201d\n\nAmong those who agree on the need to curb the wild boar population, opinions vary on how to cull them and what to do with the carcasses.\n\nMembers of the state-backed expert group suggested hunters should be allowed to use guns to improve hunting efficiency, as reported by The Paper.\n\nThey also proposed changing China\u2019s laws to allow people to consume \u201ccaptured wild boars,\u201d but only after a quarantine process to ensure the meat is safe to eat. However, the group didn\u2019t provide further details on how this would work.\n\nBoth proposals have raised safety concerns among experts outside the group.\n\nChina\u2019s top forestry authority said it was working to \u201coptimize firearms and ammunition management\u201d to \u201cfacilitate professional hunting,\u201d according to the state-owned People\u2019s Daily.\n\nCNN reached out to the authority for more details on possible use of firearms and a response to the advice to legalize the consumption of wild boars.\n\n\u201cWild boar damage has become a disaster\u2026 which actually reflects a certain imbalance in the ecological environment,\u201d the deputy head of the expert group told CCTV.\n\n\u201cTherefore, no matter what methods we use, we ultimately need to restore the flow and balance of the ecological chain to achieve true harmony between humans and nature.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCaroline Darian, the daughter of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot who sustained years of horrific sexual abuse by her then-husband and other men, has described how she\u2019s certain her father drugged her and strongly suspects she was raped too.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Darian, aged 46, described the mental \u201cburden\u201d of being the daughter of both victim and perpetrator, as she expressed her strong desire for her father to die in prison.\n\nA horrifying, monthslong mass rape and drugging trial that shook France to its core concluded last month, with 51 guilty verdicts. Dominique Pelicot and 49 others were found guilty of the rape or sexual assault of his former wife, while one of those on trial was convicted of the attempted and aggravated rape of his own wife, rather than Gis\u00e8le, having copied Pelicot\u2019s methods.\n\nThe trial \u2013 which has pushed the country to examine a culture struggling with pervasive misogyny and systemic sexual assault \u2013 has galvanized women to demand changes in the way it approaches gender-based violence.\n\nDarian described receiving a fateful phone call from her mother, one evening in November 2020, in which Gis\u00e8le informed her that her father, now 72, had been drugging Gis\u00e8le for around 10 years in order to facilitate her rape by different men.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, I lost what was a normal life,\u201d Darian told the broadcaster.\n\nDarian spoke of how she strongly suspects that she was also a victim of sexual abuse orchestrated by her father. Days after the phone call, Darian herself was called by police and shown images found on Dominique\u2019s laptop of herself lying unconscious on a bed wearing only a T-shirt and underwear \u2013 images she didn\u2019t immediately recognize herself in.\n\nShe told the BBC she knows her father drugged her, and surmises she was raped too. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any evidence,\u201d she laments.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the case for how many victims? They are not believed because there\u2019s no evidence. They\u2019re not listened to, not supported.\u201d\n\nIn court, Dominique maintained he had not abused his daughter. Earlier that day, Darian screamed at him: \u201cI\u2019ll never see you again! You\u2019ll die alone like a dog!,\u201d according to media reports.\n\nThis courtroom sketch depicts Dominique Pelicot at the courthouse in Avignon, France, on September 11. ZZIIGG/Reuters\n\nNow, she describes her father as \u201cone of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 or 30 years\u201d and has written a book detailing her family\u2019s trauma, titled \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again.\u201d\n\nShe described the reality she is faced with as a \u201cterrible burden\u201d and can now only view Dominique as the \u201csexual criminal he is.\u201d\n\nThe book also explores the concept of \u201cchemical submission\u201d \u2013 the use of drugs to facilitate criminal action against a person, including sexual abuse. It was the method Dominique used to orchestrate his wife\u2019s abuse, offering her unconscious body to strangers online.\n\nIn December, Dominique received the maximum sentence of 20 years for aggravated rape. Forty-eight other men on trial were found guilty of aggravated rape, with two guilty of sexual assault.\n\nEvidence shows how Dominique recruited the men to rape his then-wife on the now-defunct Coco.fr \u201cdating site\u201d for years, using the chatroom called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d where he would exchange pictures of an unconscious Gis\u00e8le before moving to Skype and text messages to arrange the meeting with his accomplices.\n\nGis\u00e8le testified that she was completely unaware of her husband\u2019s actions. Over time, the frequent sedation and sexual abuse began to take a physical toll. Her husband accompanied her on several doctor\u2019s visits during which she complained about memory loss and pelvic pain, according to court documents.\n\nIt was only after Dominique was arrested in a local supermarket in September 2020 for filming up the skirts of female customers, for which he was convicted, that his web of crimes came to light. Pelicot received an eight-month suspended prison sentence for this offense.\n\nWhilst investigating the upskirting, police officers confiscated his hard drive, laptop and phones and found hundreds of images and videos of Gis\u00e8le being raped, opening one of the worst sex offense cases in modern French history.",
