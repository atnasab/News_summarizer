                "text": "Reuters \u2014\n\nThe head of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan says the agency can only feed half the millions of Afghans in need after cuts in international aid and an impending freeze in US foreign funding.\n\nMany people were living on just \u201cbread and tea,\u201d WFP Country Director Hsiao-Wei Lee told Reuters.\n\nAfghanistan was tipped to the brink of economic crisis in 2021 as the Taliban took over and all development and security assistance to the country was frozen, with restrictions also placed on the banking sector.\n\nSince then humanitarian aid - aimed at funding urgent needs through non-profit organizations and bypassing government control - has filled some of the gap. But donors have been cutting steadily in recent years, concerned by Taliban restrictions on women, including their order that Afghan female NGO employees stop work, and competing global crises.\n\nLee told Reuters shortly before finishing her three-year term in Afghanistan that funding cuts had meant that roughly half the 15 million Afghans in acute need of food were not receiving rations during this year\u2019s harsh winter.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s over 6 million people who are probably eating one or two meals a day and it\u2019s just bread and tea,\u201d she said in an interview on Saturday. \u201cUnfortunately this is what the situation looks like for so many that have been removed from assistance.\u201d\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s humanitarian plan was only just over half funded in 2024, according to United Nations data, and aid officials have flagged fears this could fall further this year.\n\nThe US State Department issued a \u201cstop-work\u201d order on Friday for all existing foreign assistance and paused new aid, according to a cable reported by Reuters, after President Donald Trump ordered a pause to review if aid allocation was aligned with his foreign policy.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how that would impact Afghanistan\u2019s humanitarian operations, which in 2024 were over 40% funded by the United States, the largest donor.\n\n\u201cI think any potential reduction in assistance for Afghanistan is of course concerning\u2026whether it is assistance to WFP or another actor,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cThe levels of need are just so high here in Afghanistan. I certainly hope that any decisions made, any implementation of decisions made take into consideration the needs of the people \u2013 the women, the children,\u201d she said.\n\nWestern diplomats and humanitarian officials have said aid is dropping to Afghanistan in part due to global emergencies in Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza and also because of concerns with Taliban restrictions on women.\n\nLast week, the International Criminal Court prosecutor announced he had applied for arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders, including supreme spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, accusing them of the persecution of women and girls.\n\nLee said the operating environment had been a \u201croller coaster\u201d in the last three years, but that WFP was trying to prove to donors concerned about the plethora of restrictions on women that they were still reaching female beneficiaries and their children with aid.\n\nThough the Taliban have said female Afghan NGO workers must stop work, many humanitarian organizations have said they have been granted exemptions, especially in areas like health.\n\nLee said WFP had adapted and been able to reach women despite funding cuts and official restrictions.",

                "text": "Guatemala City CNN \u2014\n\nThe flight landed safely in the middle of the morning, the sun occasionally bursting through the clouds over Guatemala City.\n\nBut instead of taxiing to International Arrivals, the plane headed towards the military side of the airport as fighter jets screamed above, weaving around in training exercises.\n\nWhen the aircraft doors opened, dozens of men and women were ushered onto the tarmac where they were greeted by an emotional Guatemalan Vice President Karin Herrera and other officials and then led into a reception center for returnees.\n\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d one shouted. \u201cHow are you, paisanos (countrymen)?\u201d\n\nThis was a chartered deportation flight from the United States, an operation that\u2019s gained new attention since the inauguration of President Donald Trump last week and his promises to remove millions of undocumented migrants.\n\nIf there was any shame or animosity when the flight left Alexandria, Louisiana, just before sunrise, none of that was evident when the migrants walked back on Guatemalan soil, many shuffling in open sneakers \u2014 the laces having been taken by US authorities in a common safety practice, and never returned.\n\nThe passengers \u2013 all adults on this flight \u2013 were welcomed with cookies and coffee and efficient processing in the migrant reception center.\n\nRepatriation flights have been an ongoing process, Herrera told CNN, adding there had been no increase since Trump came to power. The only difference, she said, was the use of military planes such as the one arriving later on Monday.\n\nShe did not want to discuss the weekend spat between Colombia and the US over the use of military planes, saying her focus was on her citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to their integrity and their basic rights,\u201d Herrera said.\n\nSome of the returning Guatemalans had lived and worked in the US for years. Some were fluent in English. But they had all entered without permission or documents and so were subject to deportation.\n\nThe migrants left the US as criminals, telling us they were handcuffed on board until they were out of US airspace on their flight south. But whether they were looking forward to being back on home turf or not, the official reception they got was mostly very warm, as if they had been badly missed. A few did remain in handcuffs and were escorted by police, expected to face action for crimes alleged to have been committed in their homeland.\n\nBut for the majority, they sat with snacks as names were called and temporary identification papers were handed out. \u201cUndocumented\u201d no more.\n\nThey might have skills and abilities that could find them work and a good life back in their home country, benefiting themselves and Guatemala too, officials said.\n\nThe returning migrants applauded Herrera after she gave a short speech in the arrival hall but each has their own view on whether they will heed calls to stay.\n\nSara Tot-Botoz said her first thought after being processed back into Guatemala was to change out of her gray sweats and into her indigenous clothes. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nSara Tot-Botoz said her first thought after being processed back into Guatemala was to change into her indigenous clothes. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\n\u2018It feels dangerous in the US now\u2019\n\nSara Tot-Botoz had lived for 10 years in Alabama, working in construction, roofing and car repair, as well as caring for two of her children, now adults, and grandchildren.\n\nShe said she had been driving away from a Walmart with one of those grandchildren about seven months ago when she says police pulled her over and cited her for not having him in a car seat.\n\nAfter her immigration status was discovered, she spent two months in jail in Alabama and then five months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in Louisiana, she said.\n\nOnce processed back into Guatemala, she said her first thought was to get out of the shapeless gray sweats she was wearing and into her indigenous clothes. And then to eat some good food.\n\nTot-Botoz, 43, stood waiting for her belongings. Only a handful of the migrants had suitcases for their things. Most others waited for a large plastic sack to be handed over containing all that they had taken from the US.\n\nAs others charged their phones at free power banks to call friends or relatives, Tot-Botoz changed and hurried out onto the street outside.\n\nThere was another of her children, a daughter, now 25, who had not seen her mother since she was 15.\n\nThe two women hugged each other for a long time, each crying.\n\nThey had not been in contact since Tot-Botoz was taken to detention and while there was much to catch up on, for a few minutes they just wanted to hold each other.\n\n\u201cIt feels dangerous in the US now,\u201d Tot-Botoz told CNN, explaining that undocumented migrants could be picked up anywhere.\n\nTot-Botoz told CNN for now she wants to get back to her indigenous community, about a five-hour drive away, and never leave.\n\nDozens of deportees from the US are ushered to a reception center where first they are greeted by Guatemalan Vice President Karin Herrera and other officials in Guatemala City. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nA lingering American dream\n\nBut Fidel Ambrocio said he still saw his future in the US.\n\nHe said he had lived there for a total of 19 years, first arriving as a teen and voluntarily leaving for a spell in 2018 before heading back north.\n\nHe has a wife, a four-year-old daughter and a baby son, born just a couple of months before he was detained, he said, on an old warrant for trespass at the home of his ex-wife\u2019s mother.\n\nAmbrocio, 35, who\u2019d worked in construction in Montgomery, Alabama, seemed almost stunned to be back in Guatemala.\n\nHe was also angry, not comprehending why he was deported when most of the rhetoric from Trump and his team has been about sending violent offenders out of the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not criminals,\u201d he insisted, saying he did not consider his offence to be a serious crime.\n\nThe migrants CNN spoke to had all been detained while Joe Biden was president, and went through removal proceedings that led to them being on the flight from Louisiana.\n\nAmbrocio told CNN he would try to go back to the US. Legally, he said, he has to wait 10 years before applying for a visa, but he said he might try in two or four years, even if that meant travelling illegally and facing whatever the consequences might be.\n\n\u201cIf I can never go back, I will try to get my wife and kids here,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThat will be very challenging.\u201d",

Israeli authorities were notified of the hostages\u2019 status after receiving a list from Hamas, he said.\n\nAccording to Mencer, the eight dead were killed by Hamas. The Palestinian militant group has not commented on their cause of death.\n\nThe first phase of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal \u2013 which started on January 19 \u2013 will see dozens of hostages taken captive by Hamas and other armed groups in the October 7 attacks being freed.\n\nThe families of all the hostages, live or dead, set to be released in phase one of the deal were contacted by Israeli authorities Sunday evening, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum confirmed to CNN.\n\nOf the 26 hostages still to be released in phase one, 21 are men, three are women, and two are children, ranging in age from two years old to 86 years old, according to the forum and the Israeli government press office.\n\nIsrael will also release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first part of the agreement.\n\nThe ceasefire delivered a reprieve for the people of Gaza, after more than 15 months of Israeli bombing following the October 7 attacks.\n\nTens of thousands of displaced Palestinians on Monday began returning home to northern Gaza, large swathes of which have been razed by more than a year of relentless airstrikes and ground raids.\n\nFreed hostages spent over eight months in tunnels, says Israeli officer\n\nThe most recent hostages to be released from captivity were four female Israeli soldiers freed on January 25.\n\nKarina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, all 20 years old, and Liri Albag, 19, were in stable condition, the hospital director of the Israeli facility where they received treatment told CNN on Saturday.\n\nIsrael had expected female civilian Arbel Yehud to be released and delayed the opening of a corridor to northern Gaza after she was not included.\n\nOn Monday, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a new video of Yehud, in which she refers to previous hostage releases \u2013 an apparent sign the footage was taken recently.\n\nThe video\u2019s release comes amid intense Israeli pressure on Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, who have now said they will release her on Thursday, according to the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office.\n\nYehud\u2019s family has asked the media not to publish the video.\n\nSeveral of the seven hostages released from Gaza in the past week had been held in tunnels for more than eight months, according to a senior Israeli military officer.\n\nAll seven women released so far showed symptoms of mild starvation with low vitamin levels, said Avi Benov, the deputy chief of the Israel Defense Forces Medical Corps. Their mental health, he said, was a very complicated issue.\n\nThe former hostages were given vitamins and modest amounts of food during their first medical check-up at Israel\u2019s Re\u2019im military base, the officer said. They were asked if they wanted to shower and change clothes before meeting their parents and were reassured they were safe, he added.\n\nBenov claimed that Hamas had fed them better and allowed them to wash and change clothes in the days before their release, for propaganda purposes.\n\nHe said the younger hostages were in better shape, adding that when the older captives start returning they will probably be in worse condition, having spent more than a year in captivity.\n\nBenov declined to answer a question about whether there were physical signs the hostages were tortured. \u201cThey will tell their own stories,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

That is the objective of this agreement, which paves the way for further initiatives already this year.\u201d\n\nVivian Motzfeldt, Denmark\u2019s minister of statehood and foreign affairs, added that \u201cGreenland is facing a changing security landscape.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes after the European Union said it was \u201cnot negotiating\u201d on the sovereignty of Greenland\n\nAsked if the EU should negotiate the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Denmark, EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: \u201cNo, we are not negotiating on Greenland. Of course, we are supporting our member state Denmark and its autonomous region, Greenland.\u201d\n\n\u2018US shifts to a more transactional approach\u2019\n\nTrump, who took office on January 20, has previously described US control of Greenland as an \u201cabsolute necessity.\u201d Both Greenland and Denmark have said previously that the island is not for sale.\n\nThe question to Kallas on Monday came after she told a press conference that Europe needed to \u201cclose ranks\u201d as the \u201cUnited States shifts to a more transactional approach\u201d in its foreign relations.\n\nShe told the same conference that the US was an \u201cimportant ally\u201d and that America and Europe were \u201cvery much interlinked,\u201d but added that \u201cit\u2019s not like somebody is telling us what to do and we are following\u201d and warned against further speculation over Greenland.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t also go into speculation about the \u2018what ifs,\u2019 because this is not the situation right now,\u201d she said.\n\nGreenland has long been seen as key to US national security interests, particularly to repel a possible Russian attack. But during Trump\u2019s first term, national security officials were particularly concerned about China\u2019s activities in the Arctic, which at that point were a relatively new threat, a former senior Trump adviser told CNN.\n\nStill, US and Danish officials have said they don\u2019t understand the incoming president\u2019s obsession with acquiring Greenland, which Trump has called \u201can absolute necessity,\u201d particularly because the US already has a decades-old defense agreement with the territory that has allowed the US to build up a significant military presence \u2014 including troops and radar systems \u2014 on the world\u2019s largest island.\n\nOfficials in both Greenland and Denmark have come out strongly against Trump\u2019s desire to obtain the island \u2013 though multiple Danish officials have told CNN they fear the president is now more serious about the idea than when he floated it in his first term.\n\nDespite those rebuttals, the debate over Greenland\u2019s future has been stirred up by growing speculation over its independence movement.\n\nIn his New Year\u2019s speech, Greenland\u2019s prime minister said the island should break free from \u201cthe shackles of colonialism\u201d \u2013 though the speech did not mention the United States.",

Laks was initially lined up to be murdered in gas chambers, but her older sister saved her by shouting that the twins should not be separated.\n\nLaks, who was just a child when Hitler invaded her native Poland, told CNN the suffering that followed is \u201cabsolutely impossible to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs time passes over, things are being forgotten,\u201d Laks said, noting that few are left from her generation to speak out. \u201cThe world hasn\u2019t learned its lessons from what happened, from what was done.\u201d\n\nApproximately 1.1 million people were murdered at the concentration camp from 1940 to 1945, many of them Jews but also other victims of the Third Reich including Poles, the Roma, and Soviet prisoners of war.\n\nMichael Bornstein, who survived for seven months inside Auschwitz as a child, said that \u201cnothing will be easy about returning\u201d to the site.\n\nHolocaust survivors take part in the ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Oswiecim, Poland on January 27. Jakub Porzycki/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nStreams of mourners young and old laid down candles at the former concentration camp site to mark Monday\u2019s anniversary. Some bowed their heads or took a knee in front of a line of wreaths.\n\nOthers wore striped blue-and-white items of clothing like scarfs and hats, resembling the uniforms prisoners were once forced to wear.\n\nLater in the day, hundreds gathered in a large marquee, lit with bright red, pink and blue lights, to hear the stories of Holocaust survivors, including Marian Turski, 98, who was sent to Auschwitz in 1944.\n\n\u201cThose who lived to see freedom, there were hardly, hardly, none. So few. And now, there is only a handful,\u201d he told the audience.\n\nTurski said people\u2019s thoughts should go toward the millions of victims \u201cwho will never tell us what they experienced or they felt, just because they were consumed by that mass destruction.\u201d\n\nWorld leaders also gathered in Poland to mark the camp\u2019s liberation, including Britain\u2019s King Charles, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. None spoke at the event, which instead aimed to focus on the voices of survivors.\n\nBut Charles did leave a moving message in a visitor\u2019s book, after he took a tour of the former death camp, which is now a museum.\n\n\u201cRemembering what took place here, and those who were so cruelly murdered is a duty; a sacred duty that must be protected,\u201d he wrote, according to PA media.\n\n\u201cBeing here today, hearing the stories of those who experienced its horrors, seeing the shoes of children whose lives were taken when they\u2019d just begun, and walking the paths upon which such cruelty was inflicted, is something that I will never forget.\u201d\n\nHolocaust survivor Marian Turski gives a welcome address during the ceremony for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp on January 27. Aaron Chown/Pool/Getty Images\n\nAll of Auschwitz\u2019s remaining survivors were invited to the commemorations and could bring one person for support.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware of how physically demanding and emotionally taxing attending the commemoration event at the site of the former camp can be for them,\u201d the Auschwitz Memorial and Museum said in a statement.\n\nOne of the symbols of the 80th anniversary is a freight train car, which was placed directly in front of the main gate. The train car is dedicated to the memory of the approximately 420,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz.\n\nThe United Nations declared January 27 as the International Holocaust Memorial Day in 2005. Observed annually, it marks the liberation of Auschwitz in 1945 and remembers the six million Jews who lost their lives under the Nazis.\n\nGermany\u2019s Scholz said in a Monday statement: \u201cSons, daughters, mothers, fathers, friends, neighbors, grandparents: more than one million individuals with dreams and hopes were murdered in Auschwitz by Germans. We mourn their deaths. And express our deepest sympathy. We\u2018ll never forget them. Not today, not tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe museum says the event at Auschwitz offers the chance for shared commemoration and global reflection.\n\nIt comes at a time of mounting antisemitism in Europe, fueled by conflict in the Middle East which saw Israel launch a war on Gaza in response to terror attacks carried out by Palestinian militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See inside the home of father who organized the slaughter at Auschwitz 04:04 - Source: CNN See inside the home of father who organized the slaughter at Auschwitz 04:04\n\nThere has been an increase in antisemitic incidents in Europe since October 2023, with some Jewish community organizations reporting an increase of more than 400%, according to a survey from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), published in June.\n\nOf those surveyed by the FRA, 76% say they hide their Jewish identity at least occasionally and 34% avoid Jewish events or sites due to feeling unsafe.\n\n\u201cEurope is witnessing a wave of antisemitism, partly driven by the conflict in the Middle East. This severely limits Jewish people\u2019s ability to live in safety and with dignity,\u201d FRA Director Sirpa Rautio said.\n\nEvents in the Middle East have also prompted a surge in Islamophobic incidents across Europe, including arson, verbal and physical abuse and the targeting of mosques.\n\nCNN\u2019s Melissa Bell, Pierre Bairin, Mark Esplin and Chris Stern contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nTens of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning home to northern Gaza on Monday, bracing for what awaits them in a region that has been reduced to rubble by months of brutal bombardment and fighting.\n\nIsrael opened a corridor into the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, 48 hours later than initially planned. It blamed the delay on Hamas, saying the militant group breached the terms of the ceasefire agreement that guaranteed people would be able to return to the north.\n\nIsrael expected Hamas to free Arbel Yehud, a female civilian hostage, in the second round of hostage releases on Saturday. When it didn\u2019t, Israel delayed the opening of the Netzarim corridor that bisects the strip, refusing to let people into northern Gaza. Hamas then agreed to release more hostages, including Yehud, on Thursday and Saturday, the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office said Sunday.\n\nIsrael said Yehud should have been released on Saturday as Hamas is obliged to release civilians first. The four hostages released over the weekend were all female members of the Israeli military.\n\nMore than 300,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the northern Gaza Strip since Israel reopened the corridor, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza.\n\nSeen from above, the crowds on Monday resembled a huge, slow moving wave making its way up Gaza\u2019s coast, then turning inland. Most, including children, injured people and the elderly, were traveling on foot, carrying the little they have left on their backs. Most have spent many months exiled in makeshift refugee camps after Israeli forces ordered large-scale evacuations. They had been praying for this moment for months.\n\nOne woman told CNN her son was going to see his home \u2013 Gaza City \u2013 for the first time.\n\n\u201cHe was born in Khan Younis. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling that I am going back to Gaza City. It used to take us 10 minutes to get there, but this time it took a year and a half,\u201d she said, adding that she would \u201ckiss the walls and the ground\u201d upon her return.\n\n\u201cMay this be the end of the war, and may the ceasefire last\u2026 I gave birth in Khan Younis, and my husband is missing,\u201d she said.\n\nMany people have been waiting for weeks for this moment, spending the past few days sitting out in the streets or on the beach with their mattresses, belongings and water tanks, waiting for the checkpoint to open.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Drone shows thousands of Palestinians blocked from entering northern Gaza Strip 00:55 - Source: CNN Drone shows thousands of Palestinians blocked from entering northern Gaza Strip 00:55\n\nEyad Al Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, told CNN he was detained by Israel when fleeing the north and spent 75 days in Israeli prisons. He said one of his sons has been killed in the war and another one has been missing since February.\n\n\u201cI have no money or anything,\u201d he said in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, while dismantling the tent his family has been living in. \u201cI\u2019m taking these four bags and going back to my house. I don\u2019t know if it is still standing or not; I am going back to Beit Hanoun.\u201d\n\nNadia Qassem, from Al-Shati Refugee Camp, told CNN, \u201cwe have been waiting for this day for so long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to return home\u2026 Even though my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the return home will likely be marked by more heartbreak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going home, but I wish I weren\u2019t,\u201d Saadiya AbdulAl told CNN while traveling to north with an overflowing donkey cart. \u201cMy children are gone, and we are all devastated. None of my family members are left; they all became martyrs in Gaza City. Who do I go back to? I have no house and no one,\u201d she said.\n\nGaza City, where most of the people making this journey on Monday had been living before the war, is among the most destroyed areas in the strip. There are no fully functioning hospitals or schools in the area and access to water, power and basic supplies is extremely limited, despite aid flows into Gaza increasing since the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nThe Israeli military said residents could return on foot along the Al Rasheed coastal road, while vehicle traffic can pass via the inland Salah al-Din road after inspection.\n\nThe Al Rasheed coastal road was damaged during the war and remains difficult to pass in some places. At some points, people visibly struggled to get through, with wheelchairs and strollers getting stuck in the deep sand.\n\nAn Israeli military sign that reads: \"Slow!

I can\u2019t carry much; I\u2019m a dialysis patient. I only took what I sleep on,\u201d the elderly woman told CNN.\n\nArmed fighters from the Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing, were seen among the civilians, wearing their distinct green headbands. Some of those walking past cheered, some posed for photos with the masked fighters.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to firmly enforce the ceasefires in the north and south,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote in a post on X. \u201cAnyone who violates the rules or threatens (the Israel Defense Forces) will bear the full cost.\u201d\n\nHamas in a statement praised the return of the displaced as \u201ca victory for our people, and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its displacement plans.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s far-right former national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who quit in protest over the ceasefire and hostage release deal, claimed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza was a \u201ctotal surrender.\u201d\n\nFragile truce threatened by tensions\n\nEscalated tensions over Yehud\u2019s release had threatened to derail the already fragile truce.\n\nThey heightened further on Saturday after President Donald Trump said he had discussed his plan to \u201cclean out\u201d Gaza with the king of Jordan and intended to raise the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nThe US president said he would like both Jordan and Egypt \u2013 which borders Gaza \u2013 to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either temporarily or \u201clong term,\u201d telling reporters onboard Air Force One, \u201cbecause I\u2019m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it\u2019s a mess, it\u2019s a real mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a demolition site right now,\u201d Trump said of Gaza. \u201cI\u2019d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.\u201d\n\nBoth Jordan and Egypt rejected Trump\u2019s idea to shift Palestinians out of the enclave, saying such a move would displace Palestinians from their homeland. Trump\u2019s comments were also strongly condemned by Palestinian leaders and human rights groups, who denounced the forced relocation of residents as ethnic cleansing and a possible war crime.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\n\nDana Stroul, former assistant deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, told CNN that Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cfeeds this narrative\u201d that what Israel and the US really want \u201cis not a Palestinian state living next to Israel, but actually to force them somewhere else.\u201d\n\nPalestinians wait to be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, on January 26, 2025. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nSpecter of further mass displacement\n\nTrump\u2019s idea to ultimately move Gaza\u2019s residents to another country has only raised fears of further mass displacement among Palestinians.\n\nThe Palestinian Presidency said the plan \u201cconstitutes a blatant violation of red lines Palestinian leadership have consistently warned about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Palestinian people will never abandon their lands or their Holy Sites, and will not allow the repetition of the Nakba of 1948 and Naksa 1967,\u201d the presidency said.\n\nThe movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke painful memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of the 700,000 people who were expelled or fled their homes during the Nakba, or catastrophe.\n\nHundreds of thousands more were displaced during the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.\n\nThere are fears that if carried out, Trump\u2019s plan would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution.\n\nHamas in a statement said it will \u201ccategorically reject any plans to deport and displace them from their land,\u201d and called on the US administration to \u201cstop these proposals.\u201d\n\nPalestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also condemned Trump\u2019s \u201creprehensible statements\u201d and called the proposal \u201ca continuation of the policy of denying the existence of the Palestinian people, their will and their rights.\u201d\n\nHuman rights groups have also denounced the idea.\n\nHuman Rights Watch\u2019s Israel and Palestine Director Omar Shakir said in a post on X that it \u201cwould amount to an alarming escalation in the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and exponentially increase their suffering.\u201d\n\nUS-based advocacy group the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations (CAIR), said Trump\u2019s idea was \u201cdelusional and dangerous nonsense.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmerican tech billionaire Elon Musk made a surprise address at the campaign launch for Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as thousands of people gathered across the country to protest the rise of the far-right party.\n\nMusk, who spoke to the crowd in a live video, was met with huge cheers by the roughly 4,500 AfD supporters gathered inside a hall in the eastern German city of Halle on Saturday.\n\nWhile speaking with party leader Alice Weidel, AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Musk reiterated his belief that AfD is Germany\u2019s \u201cbest hope\u201d in the upcoming general election on February 23.\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, is heading to snap elections in February after Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence and his governing coalition collapsed after months of instability.\n\nAfD has seen an upswell in support, recently becoming the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazi era and performing well in opinion polls for the upcoming election. At the same time, the party has been criticized for its staunch anti-immigrant stance. All of Germany\u2019s mainstream political parties have said they will not work with the AfD.\n\nMusk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, stressed the importance \u201cthat people take pride in Germany and being German,\u201d a sentiment that was met with rapturous cheers at the AfD rally.\n\nThe billionaire also addressed the issue of immigration \u2014 a key issue in the election \u2014 urging Weidel and her supporters not to lose their national pride in \u201csome kind of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.\u201d\n\nTwo participants embrace each other as protesters hold up the lights of their mobile phones in a sea of lights demonstration against right-wing extremism on January 25, 2025, in Berlin, Germany. Omer Messinger/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of Germans protested in Berlin and other cities on Saturday against the far-right party.\n\nIn the western German city of Cologne, police estimated a crowd of 40,000 people were demonstrating, according to the Associated Press. About 35,000 protestors gathered at Berlin\u2019s iconic Brandenburg Gate, according to police estimates, where they sang anti-fascist songs, carried banners denouncing AfD, and displayed illuminated letters spelling \u201chope and resistance,\u201d AP reported.\n\n\u201cThose who fuel racism and attack climate protection are not just campaigning, they are endangering lives,\u201d climate activist Luisa Neubauer told the crowd reported AP.\n\nMusk has become increasingly engaged in the European political landscape. In recent weeks, he has kindled an alliance with AfD party leader Wiedel. Earlier in January, the two discussed Germany\u2019s election, economic, and political issues.\n\nBut the involvement of Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man and the owner of the social media platform X \u2014 has also been met with apprehension among government leaders in Europe.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the prime minister accused Musk of spreading \u201clies\u201d after the billionaire provoked a social media backlash against the British government. Musk has also pushed for the release of jailed far-right political activist Tommy Robinson and amplified a social media uproar that fueled anti-immigration riots.\n\nThe German government has even accused Musk of trying to influence its election over his endorsement of the AfD.\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Musk has continued to voice his support for the populist political movements that have galvanized numerous European elections. He has also drawn parallels between the political climate in Germany and the United States while emphasizing the global impact the approaching election could have.\n\n\u201cI think it could decide the entire fate of Europe, maybe the fate of the world.\u201d he told AfD supporters on Saturday, \u201cthat is the significance of this election.\u201d",

The 4-year-old is so popular that only 30 people are allowed to admire her for a mere three minutes each before being ushered out by security guards. On a busy weekend or holiday, tens of thousands of visitors from across China spend more than two hours in line just to catch a glimpse of her.\n\nIn Chengdu, Hua Hua\u2019s face is everywhere \u2013 in souvenir shops, cafes, post offices and on billboards. She also enjoys a massive following on Chinese social media, where her videos have racked up billions of views.\n\nHua Hua\u2019s unprecedented popularity epitomizes a new wave of \u201cpandamonium\u201d that is sweeping across China, following a decades-long government effort to transform the giant panda from a little-known animal into a cultural icon, a national symbol and a potent tool of diplomacy.\n\nBut the success of the pandas\u2019 rebranding has created an unexpected challenge for Beijing, as it seeks to balance its use of the animals for much-needed soft power abroad against the demands of an adoring public to protect their \u201cnational treasure\u201d at all costs.\n\nWhile many Chinese are proud to share pandas with the world, some \u2013 including a vocal fringe group of online influencers \u2013 oppose sending their beloved bears to the United States and other \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, ostensibly for fear they\u2019ll be mistreated.\n\nThe group\u2019s howls of protest could be heard last year outside the Dujiangyan Panda Base, the temporary home of two pandas that were sent to the US in a carefully orchestrated process cloaked in secrecy to avoid unscripted attention.\n\nSome animal rights activists and panda fans have also targeted researchers and scientists involved in China\u2019s panda breeding program, prompting the government to signal it will no longer tolerate any attempt to tarnish the conservation success story of the country\u2019s cuddly soft power asset.\n\nHua Hua, China's most famous panda, enjoys her breakfast at the Chengdu breeding base.

Tom Booth/CNN\n\nFrom obscurity to fame\n\nPandas once roamed a vast swath of China, along with parts of northern Myanmar and Vietnam, but human encroachment and climate change shrank the habitat of the bamboo-munching bears to just six mountain ranges above the Sichuan basin, deep in China\u2019s hinterland.\n\nHailed in imperial times as the \u201cland of heavenly abundance,\u201d Sichuan is now better known as the \u201chometown of pandas.\u201d The mountainous province boasts a latticework of panda nature reserves and breeding centers, all built in recent decades as China \u2013 and the world \u2013 raced to save the multimillion years old \u201cliving fossil\u201d from extinction.\n\nThe provincial capital, Chengdu, home to 21 million people, sits at the foot of snow-capped mountains with misty old-growth forests where wild pandas still roam.\n\nThe city\u2019s panda breeding base is the largest in the country, housing more than 240 bears \u2013 or a third of the world\u2019s captive panda population. The sprawling facility draws up to 11 million visitors a year, on par with Shanghai Disneyland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of China. All Chinese people want to see it in person,\u201d said a visitor who traveled 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to Chengdu and lined up at 6 a.m. to see the pandas. But the giant panda hasn\u2019t always been an emblem of the Chinese nation.\n\nThroughout much of history, these elusive bears left little impression on Chinese literature and art, let alone holding any cultural significance like the dragon, the tiger or the crane.\n\nThe obscure panda only emerged as a national icon well after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949, according to E. Elena Songster, a historian and author of \u201cPanda Nation: The Construction and Conservation of China\u2019s Modern Icon.\u201d\n\nUnique, lovable and free of historical baggage, the black and white bear was deemed an ideal symbol for the young communist nation to shape its image and identity.\n\nEven then, it took years for the panda to gain widespread recognition and adoration in an impoverished country.\n\nLiu Xuehua, an ecologist who dedicated her career to preserving panda habitat, never knew about these bears growing up in a small industrial city in southeastern China in the 1960s and 1970s. \u201cThe media wasn\u2019t so developed, we spent a lot of time studying at school and there weren\u2019t that many zoos in the provinces,\u201d she recalled.\n\nNowadays, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a Chinese child to grow up without knowing pandas \u2013 the \u201cnational treasure\u201d brought back from the brink of extinction.\n\nThey are featured in cartoons, textbooks, toy stores, and \u2013 with their captive population growing from about 100 to more than 700 in a span of decades \u2013 can now be seen in zoos across nearly every province in China.\n\nThe wild panda population has also rebounded from a low in the 1980s, reaching an estimated 1,864 by the last official count in 2014. Two years later, the giant panda was downgraded from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the global red list of threatened species.\n\nSoft power asset\n\nPandas are not only a success story for China in wildlife conservation \u2013 they\u2019re also a major soft power asset.\n\nSoft power is something China has struggled with in recent decades even as it propelled itself to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Japanese fashion, films, anime, manga and video games have long captivated fans across the globe. More recently, the \u201cKorean wave\u201d has taken the world by storm, setting off a craze for K-pop, K-drama, K-beauty, K-everything.\n\nFor China, an authoritarian state where cultural czars dictate the terms of artistic creations, the most successful tool to win hearts and minds worldwide has been \u2013 and remains \u2013 its monopoly on pandas.\n\nFor more than half a century, Beijing has dispatched these charismatic animals overseas to shore up alliances, mend estranged ties and court new partners.\n\nPandas have been a cornerstone of US-China engagement ever since a pair arrived in Washington in 1972, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s ice-breaking trip to the communist nation during the Cold War.\n\nBut relations between the US and China, the world\u2019s two most powerful nations, have sunk to their lowest ebb in decades, strained by spiraling competition over technology, military, geopolitics and more.\n\nPanda diplomacy has been a small bright spot in an otherwise darkened landscape. Last June, China sent the San Diego Zoo the first pair of pandas to enter America in 21 years. A second pair, Bao Li and Qing Bao, made their public debut last Friday at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo after arriving in Washington in October.\n\nBao Li and Qing Bao\u2019s journey, documented by a CNN team from Chengdu to Washington, was a rare piece of uplifting news amid the gloomy headlines that engulf US-China relations \u2013 from threatened tariffs and widening export controls to unprecedented cyberattacks and big power jostling.\n\n\u201cPeople want a good news story. They want something that shows we can be successful \u2026 in protecting the planet,\u201d said Ellen Stofan, the undersecretary for science and research at the Smithsonian, in October as she watched pandas loll about at Wolong Shenshuping, a mountain-ringed breeding base where Bao Li and Qing Bao were born.\n\nYet even that rare bright spot in relations couldn\u2019t fully escape the shadow of distrust and animosity between the two countries \u2013 sentiments that some fear will only deepen now that President Donald Trump is back in the White House with a cabinet staffed with China hawks.\n\nWolong Shenshuping, a mountain-ringed breeding base, is the birthplace of Bao Li and Qing Bao. Xu Han\n\n\u2018Patriotic\u2019 backlash\n\nAs the Chinese public grows fonder \u2013 and perhaps more protective \u2013 of the pandas, some online influencers have expressed concerns about the bears\u2019 welfare abroad, alleging that American zoos have mistreated China\u2019s \u201cnational treasures.\u201d\n\nSuch claims have often been fueled by the kind of nationalistic, anti-US sentiment fanned by state media. They have gained traction on the Chinese internet in recent years, especially following controversy over the health of Ya Ya, a panda previously on loan to the Memphis Zoo.\n\nIn 2023, Ya Ya\u2019s skinny looks and scraggly fur spurred concerns for her health, especially after her male partner, Le Le, died just months before the pair were scheduled to return to China. Chinese social media was awash with wild allegations that the Memphis Zoo had mistreated its pandas as a deliberate snub to China.\n\nZoo officials repeatedly dismissed such accusations, attributing Ya Ya\u2019s fur loss to a genetic skin disease \u2013 a conclusion shared by Chinese experts dispatched to Memphis to examine the panda.\n\nThe backlash didn\u2019t derail the panda loan program, which generates an annual fee of about US$1 million per pair of bears for China, but it seems to have complicated matters for everyone involved.\n\nTransporting pandas across the Pacific Ocean has always been a logistically complex undertaking that requires months of planning. Now, authorities must navigate added layers of political sensitivity and secrecy.\n\nChildren perform at the send-off ceremony for Bao Li and Qing Bao. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nThe departure date of Bao Li and Qing Bao was kept strictly under wraps, only revealed to the public by the Chinese government once their chartered plane was in the air.\n\nOnce held at panda bases, the invitation-only official send-off ceremonies now take place in hotel conference rooms away from crowds of tourists.\n\nA day before Bao Li and Qing Bao\u2019s send-off, Chinese officials rushed to change the event\u2019s location to a more secluded hotel, likely to prevent a repeat of scenes in June, when a small group of protesters gathered outside the Dujiangyan panda base with banners opposing their transfer.\n\nOn the night of their departure, as the trucks carrying Bao Li and Qing Bao drove past rows of staff bidding them farewell at the Dujiangyan base, an outburst of heart-wrenching cries erupted beyond the compound walls. CNN journalists were stopped by officials from stepping outside, but videos soon surfaced on Douyin, capturing an emotional crowd sobbing and wailing as they were held back by fences and police lines.\n\nLocal journalists who have reported on pandas for years said the crowds were part of a recent trend of \u201cextreme panda fans\u201d protesting the animals being sent overseas. Some even tried to stop their journey by bombarding panda experts, officials and government agencies with angry phone calls. \u201cThey believe they\u2019re being very patriotic,\u201d one of the journalists said.\n\nQing Bao is transported onto a truck before departing the Dujiangyan panda base. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nA truck carrying Bao Li drives past staff bidding him farewell. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nScrutiny over breeding techniques\n\nThe Chinese public\u2019s growing love affair with the bears has also brought more scrutiny to the treatment of pandas in breeding centers and zoos inside China.\n\n\u201cSo many fans are watching the live panda cams. And the Chinese institutions are extremely careful in terms of what kind of content they provide and how they\u2019re being perceived by the public. I think (that\u2019s) becoming more of a norm right now,\u201d said Qiongyu Huang, a wildlife biologist at the Smithsonian who has worked with Chinese partners on pandas.\n\nA major point of contention centers on the artificial breeding of pandas in captivity.\n\nSome panda advocates have criticized the use of electroejaculation, a common technique for collecting sperm from mammals, especially on cattle farms. It involves inserting an electric probe with mild currents into the rectum of a male under anesthesia to stimulate ejaculation \u2014 a process that some critics say is cruel and harmful. (The procedure is also used on humans when a patient cannot ejaculate on their own due to a spine injury, nerve problem or other condition.)\n\nTo address concerns, the Chengdu breeding base conducted a public experiment allowing panda fans to experience the strength of the electric currents firsthand. Visitors were invited to touch an electric probe set to the same voltage used on pandas, and according to the center\u2019s statement, none reported feeling any noticeable sensations.\n\nBut criticism and questions have persisted.\n\nWang Donghui, a researcher at the Chengdu breeding base, is known as \"Doctor Panda.\" Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nWang Donghui, a scientist at the Chengdu base, is part of a research team that developed a new technique to freeze panda semen to improve its viability \u2013 and increase the success rate of artificial insemination. The breakthrough was widely hailed in state media at the time and earned him the nickname \u201cDoctor Panda.\u201d However, Wang now avoids discussing the topic \u2014 or anything related to panda sperm and artificial insemination. \u201cWe\u2019ve been attacked,\u201d he explained off camera.\n\nThat sense of nervousness is palpable at other panda bases too. Some staff spoke of concerns that panda experts and caretakers have become frequent targets of online bullying and phone harassment; one said, only half-jokingly, that they now work in a \u201chigh-risk industry.\u201d\n\nThe intensity of online harassment has \u201cmade it difficult for some experts to carry out their research work properly,\u201d Hou Rong, a leading researcher and deputy director of the Chengdu base, told the state-run People\u2019s Daily.\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s trip to Sichuan, the New York Times published a detailed investigation into China\u2019s captive breeding program. Aggressive artificial breeding has previously killed at least one panda, burned the rectum of another and caused vomiting and injuries in others, the report said. It cited more than 10,000 pages of documents, including many from the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nChina\u2019s captive breeding program had a terrible start, its early years marred by failures at both artificial breeding and keeping cubs alive.\n\nAn official at the Chengdu base recalled in an interview with state media that in 1996, whenever scientists tried to collect sperm from pandas, the bears would end up with blood in their stools \u2013 a condition that persisted for six months at a time. \u201cThe situation at the time was extremely dire, none of the captive male pandas could produce any semen,\u201d the official was quoted as saying.\n\nThe Chengdu panda breeding base is the largest in China, housing more than 240 bears. Justin Robertson/CNN\n\nAbout a dozen cubs are born at the Chengdu panda breeding base every year. Justin Robertson/CNN\n\nPanda reproduction in captivity is notoriously difficult. Female pandas are in heat only once a year for about 24 to 72 hours. They\u2019re also very picky about who they choose to mate with. And when they finally give birth, newborn pandas are extremely fragile. In the 1990s, the survival rate of cubs under human care at some breeding centers was only 10%, according to state media.\n\nBut these hurdles had been largely overcome by the 2000s with the help of American and European scientists, said Wu Honglin, the deputy director of the Shenshuping base.\n\n\u201cWith a deeper understanding and research into pandas, along with breakthroughs in reproductive technology, it\u2019s no longer a challenge,\u201d Wu said. And the large captive population offers females more options. \u201cIn recent years, we have relied entirely on natural mating,\u201d he added.\n\nChina\u2019s breeding centers now boast cub survival rates well above 90%, and every year, dozens of new cubs are born.\n\nMelissa Songer, a conservation biologist at the Smithsonian, said China learned from past lessons. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s never been a mistake or that things couldn\u2019t get better, but I think things have gotten so much better so quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nReturn to the wild\n\nProponents of the captive breeding program say it serves as vital insurance against extinction.\n\nThe end goal is to return the pandas to the wild, and a sizable captive population is the foundation for that long and challenging effort, said Huang, the ecologist at the Smithsonian.\n\nDeep in the misty mountains above the Shenshuping breeding site lies the Tiantaishan rewilding base, where select panda cubs are prepared for life in the wild.\n\nHere, bamboo trees often have messy, broken branches \u2013 an unmistakable sign of feeding for the trained eye.\n\nWhen the cubs reach 1 year old, they are brought into the base\u2019s wild enclosures with their mothers to learn vital survival skills such as foraging, finding water, and dealing with other wildlife like black bears and wild boars.\n\nIf deemed ready, the youngster will be released into the wilderness at around 2 years old to face all its beauty, rawness, and dangers on its own. Many don\u2019t pass the strict qualification process and spend the rest of their lives in captivity.\n\nThe rewilding site is tucked deep in the cloud-shrouded mountains of the Wolong National Nature Reserve. Xu Han\n\nAt the Tiantaishan rewilding base, panda cubs get a true taste of nature and learn to survive in the wild. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nUnlike pandas born in zoos, these rewilding candidates are born in large, semi-natural enclosures, raised entirely by their mothers, with minimal human contact.\n\nStaff have come up with an intriguing way to shield the bears from people \u2013 the panda suit.\n\nKeepers here only ever interact with their animal charges while dressed in full-body panda outfits, carefully scented with panda urine or feces.\n\n\u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to trick the cubs into thinking we\u2019re pandas,\u201d explained Zhang Dalei, a keeper with over a decade of experience in the program, \u201cbut to ensure they don\u2019t develop a dependency on humans.\u201d\n\nThe work is not without its risks and at Tiantaishan, Zhang has witnessed a lesser-known, aggressive side of these cuddly bears.\n\nIn 2016, a keeper wearing a panda suit was attacked and mauled by a protective mother bear who mistook him as an intruder on her territory. When Zhang rushed to the scene, he found his colleague\u2019s wrist bones exposed, the costume soaked in blood. Though the keeper survived, the bear\u2019s powerful jaws had shattered multiple bones and tendons in his arms and legs.\n\nRewilding carries substantial risks for its trainees, too.\n\nChina\u2019s first attempt at releasing a panda into the wild in 2006 ended in tragedy when a 5-year-old bear, Xiang Xiang, was found dead in the snow less than a year later. He was believed to have fallen from height during a territorial fight with a wild male panda. The setback prompted the immediate suspension of the program.\n\nChinese researchers spent four years reflecting, learning, and refining their methods before restarting the training in its current form, where mother and cub learn to survive in the wild together. The next panda was released in 2012, and since then, 10 more have followed. One of them died six weeks after release, due to a bacterial infection, and at least two pandas perished during training, according to state media reports at the time.\n\nEach failure and loss in China were met with fierce public backlash, and the pressure has likely led researchers to err on the side of caution in releasing more pandas, Huang said. \u201cThe progress has been slow because the species is so valuable, it\u2019s like a treasure. Any misstep will have huge consequences in the public domain,\u201d he said.\n\nKeepers at the rewilding site wear a special work uniform: full-body panda suits. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nA CNN crew wore panda suits at the Tiantaishan rewilding base. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nRestoring panda habitat\n\nHabitat loss and fragmentation remain the biggest threat to wild pandas. By the early 2010s, some of China\u2019s most prominent panda experts had warned that the success in breeding the bears in captivity had masked a critical conservation failure: the species\u2019 rapidly vanishing natural habitat.\n\nOver the past few decades, China has boosted the number of panda reserves from 12 to 67, but many are interspersed with villages and human infrastructure. This has confined many panda subpopulations to isolated patches of habitat carved by roads, railways, dams and farms, cutting them off from new bamboo forests and potential mates. Some groups comprise fewer than 10 individual bears.\n\nClimate change is aggravating the problem. Studies show that a temperature rise of more than 3 degrees Celsius will result in mass death of bamboo, said Yang Hongbo, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who focuses on panda habitat.\n\nIn 2021, China took a significant step by establishing the Giant Panda National Park, spanning three provinces and covering an area more than twice the size of Yellowstone. The park aims to link existing reserves and reconnect isolated subpopulations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the habitat, ultimately, for supporting the wild pandas, for growing the wild population,\u201d Songer said.\n\nWith enough habitat, the hope is that in the future, panda cubs can be trained in the location where they will eventually be released. \u201cWhen they\u2019re ready, we only need to remove the fences around their training sites,\u201d said Zhang, the rewilding keeper. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing a home for them to settle into in advance.\u201d\n\nThe Giant Panda National Park is more than twice the size of Yellowstone. Xu Han\n\nFor now, the Chinese government remains committed to breeding pandas in captivity and loaning them to foreign zoos. It has also signaled that it will no longer tolerate overt opposition to \u201cpanda diplomacy,\u201d and moved to contain the nationalist backlash.\n\nIn December, police in Dujiangyan arrested two online influencers for spreading false rumors about pandas being abused in the US and \u201cinciting opposition\u201d to the panda exchange program. (The suspects are also accused of raking in profits of more than $23,000 through live streaming and fundraising from their followers.) Since May last year, Sichuan authorities have arrested four groups of \u201cextreme\u201d animal rights activists accused of slandering and harassing Chinese panda experts.\n\nAlongside the flurry of arrests intended to deter future \u201cextreme\u201d activism, authorities have ramped up efforts to counter negative opinions about the panda exchange program, although not everyone\u2019s convinced.\n\nA visitor to the Beijing Zoo described pandas as \u201cindispensable\u201d to China. Asked for his view about loaning pandas abroad, he replied with a laugh: \u201cThe fewer we send, the better.\u201d\n\nBack at the Chengdu panda base, Hua Hua, the 4-year-old celebrity panda, enjoyed her breakfast of bamboo shoots while the crowd oohed and aahed at her every move. The bear has become a national sensation for her unique looks: for many, she resembles a giant triangular rice ball when she sits.\n\nPanda influencer A'Qiu shares his bedroom with dozens of Hua Hua stuffed toys. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nOthers love her chill vibes \u2013 a subject of envy for millions of young people struggling to find work in China\u2019s slowing economy.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not competitive at all. We humans exhaust ourselves every day, longing to \u2018lie flat\u2019 and take it easy, but we can\u2019t. Yet Hua Hua can,\u201d said Deng Shoujuan, a staff member at the base.\n\nQi Qi, a 36-year-old Chengdu local who has visited the base more than 100 times in the past year, is in favor of sending pandas abroad.\n\n\u201cChina is the homeland of pandas, but everyone should be able feel the warmth and joy they bring. The giant panda is a gift to humanity, a gift to the world,\u201d she said.\n\nBut A\u2019Qiu, the fan who bikes to the base each day to film its most famous resident, says there\u2019s one panda he never wants to see go overseas.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about Hua Hua,\u201d he said.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBelarusians have been voting in a closely managed presidential election that is all but certain to extend the rule of Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and Europe\u2019s longest-serving leader.\n\nThe last time Belarus held a presidential election in 2020, Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory with more than 80% of the vote. The opposition cried foul, claiming that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was the rightful winner. Hundreds of thousands protested in the capital, Minsk, sparking the harshest crackdown in the country\u2019s post-Soviet history.\n\nThis year Tsikhanouskaya did not ask Belarusians to take to the streets again. The costs are too high, she said.\n\nShe should know. Since the brutal regime response in 2020, Tsikhanouskaya has lived in exile with her two children. Human rights activists say Belarus is holding more than 1,200 political prisoners, including Tsikhanouskaya\u2019s husband, Sergei, whom she has been unable to contact for nearly two years.\n\nTsikhanouskaya only ran in 2020 after her husband was jailed and prevented from running. Perhaps underestimating the political novice, Lukashenko allowed Tsikhanouskaya to run against him \u2013 an oversight that led to the greatest threat he faced in his decades-long rule.\n\n\u201cHe was complacent and completely misjudged the public mood,\u201d Nigel Gould-Davies, the United Kingdom\u2019s former ambassador to Belarus, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s taking no chances at all this time.\u201d\n\nNow, Lukashenko is facing only token challengers, one of whom has said he is running \u201cnot instead of, but alongside the president.\u201d For the first time, no independent observers monitored the vote and polling stations abroad were not be open, depriving some 3.5 million citizens outside the country of their vote.\n\nMembers of an election commission prepare ballot boxes at a polling site in Minsk, Belarus, on Sunday. Pavel Bednyakov/AP\n\nWhile not calling for large-scale demonstrations, Tsikhanouskaya urged Belarusians to voice their dissent at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking those forced to take part in this sham election to vote against all candidates,\u201d she wrote on Telegram.\n\nTsikhanouskaya\u2019s opposition movement has said the \u201celections\u201d are merely \u201ca meticulously orchestrated charade designed to perpetuate the illegitimate dictator\u2019s grip on power.\u201d The European Parliament and US State Department have also labelled the election a \u201csham.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepression is born of weakness, not strength. The unprecedented measures to stifle any opposition make it clear that the Lukashenko regime fears its own people,\u201d the State Department said last week.\n\nAfter casting his ballot Sunday, Lukashenko told journalists he did not care whether the West recognizes Belarus\u2019 election or not.\n\nLukashenko, a 70-year-old former Soviet collective farm boss, survived the scare in 2020 in part thanks to his longtime ally Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose support has become existential for the Belarusian regime.\n\nAfter state media employees resigned in solidarity with the opposition, Putin sent Kremlin propagandists to replace them. Since then, Minsk\u2019s dependence on Moscow has only deepened.\n\nPutin and Lukashenko shake hands during a meeting in Minsk, on May 24, 2024. Contributor/Getty Images\n\nBut Moscow has been exacting a price for its support. Russia used Belarus as a launch pad for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lukashenko has since allowed Russia to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil. In December, Lukashenko said he was also preparing to receive Russia\u2019s new ballistic missile, the \u201cOreshnik,\u201d first used in a strike on Ukraine late last year.\n\nAlthough Lukashenko is \u201cmore dependent on Russia and on Putin personally than ever before,\u201d there may be limits to this alliance, said Gould-Davies, now a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.\n\n\u201cBelarus has provided a wide range of valuable services to Russia, but the thing of course that it hasn\u2019t done is send its own forces (to Ukraine),\u201d he said, suggesting he may fear a backlash among his own troops or wider population if he did so.\n\n\u201cOrdinary Belarusians, emphatically, do not see this as their war, and they could not be persuaded that it is, no matter how much propaganda the Belarusian state were to pump out to them,\u201d he said.\n\nTens of thousands protested in Minsk in August after Lukashenko claimed victory in the 2020 election. Sergei Gapon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSince 2020, Lukashenko\u2019s regime has stepped up its efforts to stamp out dissent. By the end of December 2024, Belarus was holding 1,265 political prisoners, according to Viasna, a human rights group.\n\nAmong them is Ales Bialiatski, the founder of Viasna who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, alongside human rights groups from Russia and Ukraine, for his documentation of rights abuses. The oldest prisoner is Mikhail Liapeika, 76, who was sent for compulsory psychiatric treatment after insulting Lukashenko.\n\nPavel Sapelka, a lawyer with Viasna, has said many detainees are held in conditions and subjected to treatment that amounts to \u201ctorture.\u201d\n\nLukashenko will be 74 if he completes his seventh term in office. But he has given no indication that he intends to step down. \u201cAs long as I have health, I will stay with you,\u201d he said during a visit to a church outside Minsk earlier this month.\n\nLast week, Lukashenko mocked opposition leaders he said were waiting for him to \u201cdrop dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say: \u2018He is about to die, his voice is not the same, he has trouble speaking.\u2019 Don\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d Lukashenko said.",

The Lebanese army in turn accused Israel of \u201cprocrastination.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said the Israeli military launched attacks on Lebanese citizens on Sunday attempting to enter towns still occupied by Israeli forces.\n\nOf those killed, one was a soldier \u201ctargeted by gunfire from the Israeli enemy,\u201d the Lebanese army said.\n\nVideo verified by CNN showed residents on foot in Kfar Kila, southern Lebanon, trying to return to their villages. Some were seen carrying Hezbollah flags, while others held images of militant fighters killed in the war.\n\nIt comes after Israel\u2019s military issued a fresh order on Sunday to residents of dozens of southern Lebanese villages not to return to their homes.\n\n\u201cUrgent!! A new reminder to the residents of southern Lebanon: Until further notice you are prohibited from moving south to the line of villages and their surroundings,\u201d Avichay Adraee, Arabic-language spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), wrote on X.\n\nThe post included a map of southern Lebanon with an area along the border with Israel shaded red and a list of more than 60 villages residents were prohibited from accessing.\n\nA man carries an injured person in Burj al-Muluk on Sunday.

Anyone who moves south of this line puts themselves at risk,\u201d Adraee said.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its troops operating in southern Lebanon \u201cfired warning shots to remove threats in a number of areas where suspects were identified approaching the troops.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military added it had apprehended numerous suspects for questioning, claiming they posed and \u201cimminent threat to the troops.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s president Joseph Aoun said he was \u201cmonitoring this issue at the highest levels\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201cLebanon\u2019s sovereignty and the unity of its territory are not subject to compromise,\u201d he said and promised residents of the south he would \u201censure your rights and dignity.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations called on both sides to urgently recommit to the agreement while its peacekeeping force said it was deploying to areas in southern Lebanon at the request of the Lebanese army.\n\nThe president of France, Emmanuel Macron urged Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to withdraw his remaining forces from Lebanon in a phone call on Sunday, according to the French President\u2019s office. France played a key role in brokering the ceasefire deal alongside the US last November.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSouth Korean prosecutors have indicted the suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol on insurrection charges over his brief declaration of martial law.\n\nYoon attempted to impose martial law in early December, a move that plunged the country into political turmoil and for many brought back painful memories of the country\u2019s authoritarian past.\n\nThe president justified the declaration by accusing the main opposition party of sympathizing with North Korea and of anti-state activities but it was swiftly overturned by parliament.\n\nYoon \u2013 who denies wrongdoing \u2013 was then voted to be impeached by parliament and has been in custody since being arrested last week.\n\nProsecutors announced the charges on Sunday evening local time, making Yoon the first sitting president in the country\u2019s history to be indicted.\n\n\u201cBased on the investigation so far, there are no grounds to consider any change to the arrest warrant issued against the president,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement Sunday, adding that \u201csufficient evidence exists to substantiate the charges.\u201d\n\nDuring parliamentary hearings, Yoon\u2019s commanders testified that they received direct orders to break down the doors of the parliament to \u201cdrag out\u201d lawmakers sitting inside. Yoon has denied this.\n\nShortly after declaring martial law, Yoon allegedly told the first deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, Hong Jang-won, he should take the opportunity to \u201carrest\u201d a list of 14 political and legal figures including the opposition leader and \u201cclean everything up.\u201d\n\nYoon allegedly said he would give the intelligence service authority to launch a counter-intelligence probe and \u201csupport it with funds, personnel unconditionally.\u201d\n\nDetails were first revealed to reporters by lawmakers briefed about the conversation, and Hong confirmed to CNN the veracity of the content.\n\nThe move is the latest development in a political saga kicked off by the president\u2019s martial law declaration.\n\nThe embattled president had been holed up in his fortified residence for weeks surrounded by his Presidential Security Service team before his arrest.\n\nThe country\u2019s Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) first attempted to detain him earlier this month, but it failed after an hours-long showdown in which soldiers and members of the presidential security detail blocked some 80 police and investigators from approaching the presidential compound.\n\nThe CIO was able to arrest Yoon on their second attempt, but Yoon has been refusing to cooperate with any of the CIO\u2019s investigations.\n\nYoon\u2019s party dismissed the indictment, calling the CIO\u2019s investigation records \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nHis lawyers said \u201cthe prosecution has committed a historic mistake\u201d in a statement, claiming that Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law does not amount to an insurrection crime.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s main opposition Democratic Party, however, welcomed the indictment and urged the court to hold Yoon \u201caccountable for his violations of constitutional order and his trampling on democracy.\u201d\n\nWith Sunday\u2019s indictment, Yoon is now facing two trials: one over his impeachment case at the country\u2019s Constitutional Court, which will determine his political fate - likely by spring -and decide whether he will be formally removed from the presidency or reinstated. The second is the criminal case of insurrection.\n\nYoon \u2013 who is a former prosecutor \u2013 could face life in jail or the death penalty if convicted of leading insurrection, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.\n\nUnder South Korean law, a sitting president has immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of insurrection or treason.\n\nYoon\u2019s former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, some military commanders and police chiefs were also previously indicted following Yoon\u2019s declaration of martial law.",

Last month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs hit a crowded market in Kabkabiya, a town in North Darfur.\n\nGhebreyesus did not name who was responsible for Friday\u2019s attack.\n\nThe SAF and the RSF, both headed by two of Sudan\u2019s most powerful generals, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo - also known as Hemedti - frequently accuse each other of carrying out drone attacks on civilian areas.\n\nDarfur Governor Mini Minnawi blamed the RSF for the hospital attack, saying: \u201cIt exterminated all the patients who were inside it.\u201d\n\nSudan\u2019s foreign ministry also accused the RSF of the strike, describing the attack as a massacre.\n\n\u201cMore than 70 civilians receiving treatment, most of them women and children, were victims of the massacre when the militia attacked the hospital\u2019s accident department with drones,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe RSF has not commented on the allegations and CNN has sought comment.\n\nThe Saudi hospital, El Fasher\u2019s remaining public facility with the capacity to perform surgery and treat the wounded, has previously come under fire. Last August, a patient carer was killed when an air strike hit the hospital\u2019s surgical ward. Five others were injured in that attack.\n\nThe RSF controls large swathes of Darfur, including much of the country\u2019s western and central regions as it viciously competes for control of the region with the Sudanese military. El Fasher is the last major town in Darfur yet to be captured by the RSF.\n\nWHO chief Ghebreyesus said Friday\u2019s hospital attack is making life for people in the region even more difficult as it \u201ccomes at a time when access to health care is already severely constrained\u201d in North Darfur \u201cdue to the closure of health facilities following intense bombardments.\u201d\n\nGhebreyesus called on warring parties to cease fighting and to leave Sudan\u2019s health facilities alone, adding that, \u201cabove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",

Enter with sound Enter without sound\n\nCNN Special Report How Gaza\u2019s hospitals became battlegrounds\n\nRelentless bombardment, power outages and shortages have pushed nearly every hospital in the beleaguered northern Gaza Strip out of service, with evidence of repeated attacks on and in the vicinity of medical facilities despite the presence of doctors, patients and civilians inside, a CNN analysis has found.\n\nAt least 20 out of 22 hospitals identified by CNN in northern Gaza were damaged or destroyed in the first two months of Israel's war against Hamas, from October 7 to December 7, according to a review of 45 satellite images and around 400 videos from the ground, as well as interviews with doctors, eyewitnesses and humanitarian organizations. Fourteen were directly hit, based on the evidence collected and verified by CNN and analyzed by experts.\n\nIsrael launched its bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terrorist attack, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. In the first two months of the war, at least 17,100 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on the strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. At the time of publishing, that number was more than 23,400.\n\nIsrael says that Hamas operates inside and underneath hospitals, and is using them for military operations, including as command centers, weapons stores and to hide hostages. The Israelis have released footage they say is evidence of those Hamas operations. The videos do not offer definitive proof, and Hamas has denied the claims.\n\nCNN sent a list of the hospitals identified as damaged or destroyed to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In response, the IDF said it \u201cdid not conduct any targeted attacks against hospitals in the Gaza Strip,\u201d adding that \u201cHamas systematically misuses hospitals and medical facilities.\u201d\n\nTracking how aerial bombardment has impacted hospitals in northern Gaza gives a sense of the scale and scope of devastation that the war has wrought on the enclave\u2019s health system \u2014 and the knock-on impact to civilians who have relied on the facilities for shelter and care, and are more in need of their services now than ever before.\n\nHospital Damaged or destroyed Gaza City Direct attack Zikim GAZA Med.

Of those, 20 were damaged or destroyed in relentless bombardment during the first two months of the war. Satellite imagery showed craters near 11 of the hospitals were consistent with those left behind by 2,000-pound bombs. The munitions were dropped near enough for the hospitals to be within the lethal fragmentation radius, which is up to 365 meters (about 1,198 feet). Fourteen hospitals were directly hit. Several, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, appeared to have been attacked by Israel.\n\nImagery obtained by CNN showed that two hospitals were completely flattened. Attacks on and around the strip\u2019s three pediatric hospitals forced them to cease services. The only hospitals offering dedicated cancer and psychiatric treatment also stopped operating after having been damaged. By the end of the period reviewed, only four hospitals were partially functioning, according to OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency. None had surgery capacity.\n\nThe International Eye Hospital, in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City, was damaged in early October. It was no longer standing by October 12, according to satellite imagery. Balsam Hospital, in the west of Beit Hanoun, was reduced to rubble by November 3. Craters consistent with 2,000-pound bombs were visible near both medical facilities. Maxar Technologies, photos from November 26, 2023\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on December 21 that no hospitals were functioning in northern Gaza and injured patients who were unable to be moved were \u201cwaiting to die.\u201d According to the WHO, as of January 10, six hospitals in the north were partially functioning.\n\nTo provide a window into how Gaza\u2019s hospitals became battlegrounds, CNN took an in-depth look at the deterioration of the strip\u2019s biggest and second biggest medical facilities, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, up until they ceased operations in November. Al-Shifa has since resumed some services.\n\nIsraeli authorities say both hospitals have been used by Hamas for military purposes. The IDF published images of a tunnel shaft and military equipment it said its forces found inside the Al-Shifa complex and video of what appeared to be an armed man outside Al-Quds Hospital. Hamas and hospital officials have denied that the militant group has operated from inside the facilities.\n\nTaken together, the two hospitals reflect the similarities CNN observed in reviewing evidence from the first two months of the war: that what should be protected facilities are being bombed, encircled and shot at by tanks, and that surrounding infrastructure, ambulances and roads are being hit, affecting efforts to treat patients, evacuate facilities and deliver aid.\n\nSeveral of the hospitals assessed as part of this analysis, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, appeared to have been attacked by Israel, according to imagery of munitions fragments, large impact craters, tanks, tank shell holes and tracks from heavily armored vehicles. Experts who reviewed the imagery for CNN said that the aftermath was consistent with damage from high-grade military weaponry used by the IDF.\n\nIsraeli flares light up the night sky above Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on November 6, 2023. Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAn earlier CNN investigation determined that a failed Palestinian rocket fired from Gaza was likely the cause of a deadly blast at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, on October 17.\n\nIn other cases, it was not possible to determine responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe IDF has repeatedly said it does not target hospitals but has admitted to returning fire at some facilities, including Al-Quds. In response to CNN\u2019s analysis, the IDF said that strikes against targets near hospitals \u201cundergo a thorough planning process,\u201d to ensure the munitions chosen mitigate damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and that any strike expected to incidentally damage hospitals \u201cis approved by the highest echelons of command.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur forces on the ground know where these hospitals are, and nodes are taken into account when they're operating,\u201d a legal adviser to the IDF told CNN about the process. \u201cBut at the end of the day, as long as Hamas continues to use these hospitals and facilities for the military operations, and our aim is to defeat Hamas militarily, there is absolutely no choice but to go there.\u201d\n\nInjured Palestinians lie on gurneys in the courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital, where thousands of displaced people sought shelter, on November 25, 2023.

It is illegal, with few exceptions, to attack hospitals, ambulances or other health facilities, or to otherwise prevent them from providing care. A hospital can lose its special protected status only if it is used by an armed group for acts that are \u201charmful to the enemy.\u201d But, even if a hospital loses its special status, the wounded and sick inside are still protected by the principle of proportionality. A warning must be given, and time for safe evacuation, before carrying out an attack.\n\n\u201cIn many cases it's impossible to evacuate everyone from a hospital, so there are still medical personnel and patients inside,\u201d Cordula Droege, the chief legal officer of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN. \u201cThe onus is on the attacker... to take all precautions to avoid that they come to harm.\u201d\n\nAl-Quds Hospital\n\nIsrael has repeatedly called for the evacuation of 22 hospitals in northern Gaza. But doctors operating in the hospitals, as well as international organizations, have said the evacuation of injured patients and staff is incredibly dangerous, if not impossible, amid the fighting.\n\nIsrael first ordered Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to be evacuated on October 14, according to the humanitarian organization. The group, which is affiliated with the ICRC, said that it couldn\u2019t evacuate the hospital\u2019s 500 patients \u2013 particularly those in the ICU and babies in incubators \u2013 nor could it move 12,000 displaced people, many of them women and children, who had sought refuge there.\n\nCNN used a 3D model to reconstruct the attacks on and in the vicinity of Al-Quds Hospital, drawing on verified videos and images from social media, as well as aerial footage shared by the IDF. On October 18, Al-Quds was rattled by airstrikes about 100 meters (328 feet) away. Videos filmed from the hospital showed an explosion lighting up the night sky and a building nearby being struck, as people huddled inside the hospital\u2019s front entrance. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society More strikes were reported near the hospital on October 22. On the same day, Saleem Aburas, a PRCS relief coordinator, shared footage from outside of Al-Quds showing fragments that he said were from \u201coccupation army missiles.\u201d Marc Garlasco, a military adviser at the Dutch organization PAX for Peace and a former UN war crimes investigator, said that it looked like remnants from a military-grade aerial munition, not a Hamas rocket. Palestine Red Crescent Society Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said the fragments were most likely from \u201chigh explosive projectiles fired from tanks or artillery guns,\u201d which could have been fired from \u201csomething like a main battle tank, but also something like a self-propelled howitzer.\u201d A week later, on October 29, another strike hit several meters away from Al-Quds. Footage from inside showed windows blown out, broken glass and rubble, and people rushing from smoke-filled rooms coughing and covering their mouths. Outside, a cloud of smoke billowed from the site. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society The PRCS said that Israel had warned it to evacuate ahead of the bombardment and alleged it was deliberately striking \u201cnext to Al-Quds\" to force people out. The IDF told CNN that it had issued multiple evacuation warnings. Al-Quds\u2019 director, Dr. Bashar Mourad, said there were no safe routes to flee and that ambulances attempting to move south were targeted with artillery fire. \u201cThe bombings are occurring all around us,\u201d Mourad told CNN. As Israel\u2019s ground forces closed in on Gaza City, explosions around Al-Quds became an almost daily occurrence. On November 2, the PRCS said Israeli military vehicles about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) south of the hospital fired bullets \u201cindiscriminately,\u201d injuring two people standing outside and penetrating the hospital\u2019s sixth floor, sharing a photo of what Garlasco said appeared to be an unexploded mortar embedded in an interior wall. Palestine Red Crescent Society A day later, the PRCS said that at least 21 people were injured at Al-Quds when internal glass walls shattered, and part of the ceiling fell due to Israeli strikes. Blasts were reported nearby on November 4 and 5, with videos showing the aftermath, including a building that was destroyed a couple of blocks away and broken glass inside the ICU. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society The IDF released aerial footage on November 7 showing a strike on a building, which they claimed was a Hamas weapons depot, and that CNN geolocated to just over 100 meters (328 feet) from Al-Quds Hospital. It appeared to be the same block targeted on November 5. Israel Defense Forces CNN reviewed satellite imagery of Al-Quds and the surrounding area throughout October and November. On November 7, when people were still sheltering there, the hospital was surrounded by damaged buildings and large craters. Garlasco said that one large crater to the west of the hospital looked like the result of a precision-guided munition, and was consistent with the aftermath of either a 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or precision artillery used by the IDF.\n\nOn November 10, the PRCS said that one person was killed, and 28 others injured, most of them children, when Israeli forces opened fire at the hospital\u2019s ICU. The group said that continuous shelling had destroyed nearby streets, blocking aid in and evacuations out of the hospital. Amid power outages caused by dwindling fuel, videos showed doctors operating by flashlight.\n\nThe IDF released footage on November 13 that it said showed a group of armed men at the entrance of Al-Quds Hospital, at least one of whom appeared to be carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Israel said in a statement that its forces killed \u201capproximately 21 terrorists\u201d when they returned fire after the militants shot at their tank from the hospital, adding that civilians were seen leaving the hospital during the exchange.\n\nThe PRCS condemned Israel\u2019s \u201cfalse claims\u201d and said no armed individuals were operating in Al-Quds. A video shared by Aburas, the PRCS relief coordinator, showed an Israeli tank firing on Al-Quds from the same location pictured in the IDF footage. The person filming ducked away from the window and a woman could be heard crying in the background.\n\nreplay with audio An Israeli tank fires towards Al-Quds. Saleem Aburas\n\nAl-Quds Hospital ceased operations on November 13. Soon after, footage showed hundreds of people fleeing to the south on foot, with some being carried on stretchers.\n\nWhen asked about how Israel assesses proportionality when considering whether to attack hospitals, the IDF legal adviser told CNN: \u201cIn our situation, that [proportionality] is almost irrelevant, because, on the whole, we haven't conducted attacks against hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been a very small number of occasions where because there\u2019s been an immediate threat to the life of our soldiers we\u2019ve had to fire at hospitals,\u201d the legal adviser added, referring to Al-Quds.\n\nreplay with audio Hundreds of people evacuate the hospital. Palestine Red Crescent Society\n\nCraig Jones, a lecturer at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, rejected the notion that proportionality might not be relevant, saying that the rule applies whenever a military objective is the object of an attack. For his book, \u201cThe War Lawyers,\u201d Jones examined the laws of war applied by military lawyers to targeting operations carried out by the IDF in Gaza.\n\n\"They are careful, deliberate calculations that take place behind the scenes. And I think it's a point worth emphasizing that much of the death and destruction that we see, including damage to the hospitals, is known in advance,\u201d Jones told CNN, adding that the damage is a calculated choice, not an inevitability.\n\nTwo months of siege left Al-Quds Hospital surrounded by flattened buildings, satellite imagery showed. Some of the surrounding craters were covered by tracks from armored vehicles.

CNN has added blur to protect the identity of patients. Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAbout 2.6 kilometers (1.6 miles) north of Al-Quds, Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has emerged as another flashpoint. Israel has said that a Hamas command center sits underneath the medical complex and that the group has used it to hold hostages, repeatedly calling for the hospital to be evacuated. Hamas has denied the claims, as have health officials working there.\n\nIn the first weeks of the war, patient numbers at Al-Shifa surged. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon who was working at the hospital, told CNN on November 3 that it was operating off only one generator. \u201cUnless there's electricity, this hospital will turn into a mass grave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's as simple as that: If we cannot keep the ventilators running, if we can't take our critically wounded patients back to the operating room, then there's nothing for this place other than to come and die.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, an Israeli airstrike hit a convoy of ambulances, which hospital authorities said were being used to evacuate the wounded, including one outside the entrance of Al-Shifa, killing 15 people and wounding 60 others. Videos from the scene, verified by CNN, showed about a dozen people lying bloodied and motionless. Garlasco, who analyzed the footage, said that cubic fragmentation could be seen on the ambulance door, as well as the clothes of people killed and wounded, which was consistent with aftermath from an Israeli Spike anti-tank guided missile.\n\nThe IDF said it had targeted the ambulance because it was \u201cbeing used by a Hamas terrorist cell,\u201d accusing the group of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances but did not offer evidence. Hamas rejected the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n100 feet 30 meters Intensive Care Unit Ambulance attack Nov. 3 . . Courtyard Nov. 10 . Al-Shifa Hospital Outpatient clinic Nov. 10 .

Satellite imagery from November 7 showed blue and white tarpaulins in the hospital\u2019s courtyard and parking lot where people had set up makeshift shelters. Videos captured crowds of people crammed inside, sleeping in hallways and stairwells. On November 10, just after 1 a.m. a projectile flashed across the sky and crashed into the courtyard. Footage of the aftermath showed a man, his leg maimed, crying out in pain and blood spattered across the concrete. replay with audio Ahmed Hijazi It was the first of several strikes that morning on different parts of the complex, including the hospital\u2019s maternity department and outpatient clinic. Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, director-general of the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, told CNN that there were 15 casualties in the strikes, and that bodies were piling up but could not be buried. Some 400 patients and 20,000 displaced people were still inside the medical facility, he said. The Israeli military claimed a projectile launched by Palestinian militants and aimed at IDF troops operating in the area had hit the hospital. But at least two of the projectiles that struck the site appeared to have been Israeli munitions, according to footage verified by CNN and reviewed by experts. In one of the first videos filmed in the aftermath of the courtyard strike, people could be seen probing a munition remnant that, according to Garlasco, appeared to be an Israeli illumination artillery round. What is an illumination shell? The round is fired, then releases an illuminating canister with a parachute attached, which illuminates target areas at night. Sources: US Army, Saleh Aljafarawi (image) Another video captured a metal fin amid rubble and debris in the maternity department, which was hit a few hours later. Senft told CNN the remnants and structural damage were \u201cconsistent with the tail assembly of several Israeli tank gun projectiles,\u201d but added that without remnants of the warhead it was not possible to determine the type of tank projectile. Garlasco said the tail fins appeared to be from Israeli 120-millimeter high explosive tank shells. The Israeli high explosive tank shell Designed to defeat medium and light armored vehicles and infantry, it has an effective range of over 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). Sources: Elbit Systems, Saleh Aljafarawi (image) Another strike hit the maternity department after 8 a.m., blowing out a large section of the upper floor of the building, which was seen in footage of the aftermath and satellite imagery. replay with audio Saleh Aljafarawi \u201cThe destruction of the outer wall combined with the fragmentation and tail entry hole are all indicative of a 120-millimeter tank round,\u201d Garlasco said. \u201cThese shells have a 4,000-meter range and often over-penetrate in urban areas, meaning it is possible the IDF was engaged with Hamas some distance from the hospital and either missed their targets, or the rounds continued until they hit the hospital.\u201d Around 10 a.m., a projectile hit the outpatient clinic, near the maternity unit. Footage showed a gaping hole in the corrugated metal roof covering an area where displaced people were sheltering, and a man lying motionless on the ground. Garlasco and Senft, the weapons experts, said they could not be definitive about what caused the strike based on the blast hole alone. Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, who was in Al-Shifa at the time, said on November 11 that the hospital\u2019s ICU and pediatric department had also been hit, and that doctors were having to move patients within the complex as strikes continued. replay with audio Patients are moved amid strikes. Khader Al Za\u2019anoun/CNN Footage and photos showed dozens of premature babies being rushed from the neonatal unit\u2019s incubators after the oxygen supply ran out, wrapped in foil to keep warm. Newborn babies taken from incubators and placed together in a bed. Khader Al Za\u2019anoun/CNN Khader Al Za\u2019anoun, a freelance journalist for the Palestinian news agency WAFA, who was embedded at the hospital, sent CNN scores of videos and photos showing the deterioration of the complex. One of the clips captured the aftermath of strikes on the ICU, which was covered in dust and rubble. Holes were visible in the walls that were consistent with the shape left behind by Israeli tank missiles, Garlasco told CNN. Over the next few days, amid pouring rain, Al Za\u2019anoun recorded people at the hospital digging graves in the courtyard, bringing bodies down for burial. In a series of videos, a 10-year-old girl, Sumaiyah Al-Hossary, could be seen following her mother\u2019s body as she was carried outside on a gurney, wrapped in a blue blanket with white flowers and marked with her name in masking tape. Cellphone in hand, Al-Hossary filmed her mother's burial before placing a leaf atop her grave. The same mass grave was observed by a WHO team that led a mission to Al-Shifa a week later. They said they were told more than 80 people were buried there and described the hospital as a \u201cdeath zone.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with CNN on November 12 that there was \"no reason\" patients could not be evacuated from Al-Shifa after the IDF opened an evacuation corridor on the eastern side of the hospital. But doctors said they had refused the IDF\u2019s evacuation orders for fear of what would happen to their 700 at-risk patients.\n\nOn November 15, Israeli tanks surrounded Al-Shifa. Satellite imagery showed large sections to the north and south of the hospital had been bulldozed ahead of the raid. A doctor told CNN the IDF gave them a 30-minute warning before they swarmed the complex. The Palestinian journalist, Al Za\u2019anoun, said Israeli forces had \u201cinvaded the hospital with large numbers of soldiers and military vehicles, including tanks, armored vehicles, troop carriers, and bulldozers,\u201d adding they were preventing anyone from leaving.\n\nThe IDF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the report, but did say that its operation at Al-Shifa involved troops entering from the ground \u201cin order to minimize\u201d interference with medical care, and limit harm to patients or medical personnel.\n\nA senior US intelligence official told CNN that the US had independently corroborated information suggesting that Hamas and other Gaza militants were using Al-Shifa Hospital as a command hub, but added that Hamas members had largely evacuated days before the IDF raid.\n\nDays later, Israeli soldiers were still inside the complex conducting searches and interrogations, and officers said they had found rifles, ammunition and other military equipment inside. \u201cThey are within the hospital now, they are troops, in front of me while I am talking. We can see them checking and searching this part of the hospital,\u201d a senior plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, Dr. Ahmed El Mokhallalati, said, adding that staff were being questioned about Hamas.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, was detained and later arrested along with several other medical staff.\n\nDoctors and other people dig a mass grave in the Al-Shifa Hospital courtyard on November 14, 2023. Khader Al Za\u2019anoun/CNN\n\nOn November 19, the IDF released footage showing a tunnel shaft and an entrance to what it called an \u201cunderground facility,\u201d which it said it would demolish. The IDF also took CNN and other news organizations to show them the shaft on the grounds of Al-Shifa. But the evidence did not establish without a doubt that there was a command center underneath the hospital.\n\nAfter weeks living under siege, civilians who had been trapped inside Al-Shifa finally started to leave, fleeing to the south of Gaza, footage showed. The PRCS said 31 premature babies were successfully evacuated from the hospital to Egypt for medical treatment.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, UN high commissioner for human rights, said that the events at Al-Shifa beggared belief and that while hundreds of people had fled the hospital, \u201cNowhere is safe in Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules of international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out the attacks must be strictly adhered to,\u201d T\u00fcrk said. \u201cFailure to adhere to these rules may constitute war crimes.\u201d",

Last week, Musk faced a backlash after he made a gesture at a post-inauguration rally last week that some commentators said resembled a fascist salute.\n\nAt a rally following US President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration last Monday, Musk brought his right arm towards his chest and then extended it towards the audience, drawing scrutiny as the gesture bears similarities to the Nazi or Roman salute used by fascist leaders in Germany and Italy.\n\nMusk pushed back on the criticism, writing on X, \u201cthe \u2018everyone is Hitler\u2019 attack is sooo tired.\u201d\n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz \u2013 a frequent target of Musk\u2019s barbs \u2013 told a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: \u201cEveryone is free to express their opinion in Germany and Europe, including billionaires\u2026 but we do not accept support for far-right positions.\u201d Musk responded on X: \u201cShame on Oaf Schitz!\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Musk, saying that he was \u201cfalsely smeared\u201d amid a storm of international condemnation.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) initially dismissed it as \u201can awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nHowever, in response to Musk posting a series of Nazi puns to social media on Thursday, the ADL hit out at \u201cinappropriate and highly offensive jokes that trivialize the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nDespite the scrutiny, Musk has continued to voice his support for populist political movements that have galvanized numerous European elections. He has also drawn parallels between the political climate in Germany and the United States while emphasizing the global impact the approaching election could have.",

                "text": "Tallinn, Estonia CNN \u2014\n\nOn Christmas morning, Estonia\u2019s power grid operators got an unwanted surprise: The Estlink 2 power cable linking them to Finland had failed.\n\nThe outage left only the Estlink 1 cable in operation, reducing the electricity flow to Estonia by almost two-thirds.\n\nThe rupture had little impact on services due to reserve capacities. However, it sparked fears energy prices would rise while the cable remains offline \u2013 potentially for months.\n\nThe following day, Finnish officials boarded and detained the Eagle S, a Cook Islands-flagged tanker they said was carrying oil from Russia to Turkey. It had passed over the cable, apparently dragging its anchor, Finnish officials said.\n\nAs Estonia\u2019s defense minister, Hanno Pevkur, was quick to point out in an interview with CNN in Tallinn last week, it wasn\u2019t the first such suspected \u201chybrid attack\u201d in recent months, all with the same apparent modus operandi. He acknowledged, though, that some believe what happened to have been accidental.\n\nBut it was to be the most consequential.\n\nNATO, already tracking incidents of suspected cable-cutting, responded. Within three weeks, the alliance had put a coordinated group of warships to sea specifically to deter such suspected attacks.\n\nAnnouncing the new surveillance and deterrence mission, dubbed Baltic Sentry, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he had \u201cgrave concern\u201d about a \u201cgrowing threat to our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d\n\nDrone footage shows German minesweeper crew preparing and launching sophisticated undersea drone, part of NATO\u2019s Baltic Sentry. CNN\n\nWhile NATO had already stepped up Baltic Sea patrols, and increased coordination with national police and border guards from the nations affected, the December 25 incident was only the latest in what the European Union described as \u201ca series of suspected attacks on critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nRussia denies any role in the damage. But Pevkur doesn\u2019t buy it, blaming Russia\u2019s sanctions-busting ships, a so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of aging tankers accused of seeking to evade Western restrictions on the sale of Russian oil.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this as it is, and we know that these vessels, when we talk about the shadow fleet, are a threat, not only from the security point of view, but first and foremost, from the environmental point of view,\u201d Pevkur said.\n\nIt is an open skepticism already shared by many in Baltic Sentry.\n\nThe Swedish Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office confirmed Sunday it had seized a ship on suspicion of carrying out sabotage, after suspected damage to a communications cable running under the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Latvia.\n\nA photo taken on December 28, 2024, in the Gulf of Finland, shows Cook Islands-flagged oil tanker Eagle S (right), next to a Finnish border guard ship and tugboat. Jussi Nukari/Lehtikuva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSuspected Russian connections\n\nLast week, aboard the icy-decked Netherlands frigate HNLMS Tromp \u2013 Baltic Sentry\u2019s state of the art flagship \u2013 the mission commander told CNN it was already putting together a pattern of Baltic maritime activity that questions Russia\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cA lot of the ships that we found are acting strangely originate in a Russian port or (are) going to a Russian port,\u201d said Commodore Arjen S. Warnaar, who leads Standing NATO Maritime Group One.\n\nHe said ships\u2019 anchors had in some case been dragged \u201ca couple of hundred miles,\u201d adding that in terms of claims the crews had not noticed this was happening, \u201cmy guess is, no, a captain does know that\u201d \u2013 meaning the anchor dragging was \u201cprobably intentional.\u201d\n\nFinnish authorities are yet to announce the findings of their investigation into the Estlink 2 failure.\n\nThe Dutch head of the NATO marine group assigned to protect the Baltic Sea\u2019s seabed infrastructure, Commodore Arjen S. Warnaar, on board the Dutch frigate HNLMS Tromp. Sarah Dean/CNN\n\nFinnish lawyer Herman Ljungberg, who represents the owner of the Eagle S, United Arab Emirates-based Caravella LLC FZ, told CNN he believes the ship was carrying Russian oil but said it was \u201cfully legal cargo\u2026 sold under the applicable price cap.\u201d He called the allegation of sabotage \u201cnonsense\u201d and said the Finnish police had been investigating for four weeks without communicating any findings indicating sabotage. He also said the ship\u2019s alleged damage to undersea equipment happened outside of Finland\u2019s territorial waters and that therefore Helsinki lacked jurisdiction to intervene.\n\nRussia has denied allegations of involvement in underwater cable sabotage. The Russian Embassy in London last week said NATO was building up naval and air forces under the \u201cfictitious pretext of the \u2018Russian threat.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn anchor recovered from the Gulf of Finland in connection with the criminal investigation into the cable rupture that took place on December 25, 2024. Finland Police\n\nOutages\u2019 global impact\n\nUnder the Baltic Sea, there are dozens of vulnerable internet and power cables, laid mostly unprotected on the seabed. According to Rutte, more than 95% of internet traffic globally is carried via undersea cables, with some 1.3 million kilometers of such cabling securing an estimated $10 trillion dollars of international trade daily.\n\nRepairs can be costly, and damage can take months to fix. Although undersea networks often have built-in redundancy, a concerted attack could paralyze many nations\u2019 communications networks, jeopardizing hospital surgeries, police responses and more.\n\nEven small outages could deny tens of thousands access to their favorite shows and movies, and impact online shopping and home deliveries.\n\nIn a life dependent on the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d a ship\u2019s anchor dragged hundreds of miles away can ruin your day.\n\nEarly last week, NATO's Baltic Sentry mission consisted of three ships: German minesweeper FGS Datteln, Dutch frigate HNLMS Tromp and Dutch hydrographic survey vessel HNLMS Luymes. CNN\n\nOnly last week, according to the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence, the British navy was forced to escort what it described as a Russian spy ship through the narrow English Channel, \u201cweeks after it was caught loitering over critical undersea infrastructure in UK waters.\u201d\n\nJust a day earlier, the UK had announced it was sending maritime aircraft to join the Baltic Sentry operation, alongside ships sent by Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nFrance also has a mine hunting ship in the task group, the CMT Croix du Sud.\n\nEarlier this month, French Armed Forces Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu decried \u201caggressive Russian action\u201d after a French maritime patrol aircraft was locked onto by the fire control radar of a Russian S400 air defense system and GPS signals also jammed, while patrolling international airspace as part of Baltic Sentry. GPS jamming is nothing new \u2013 for months, it has impeded civilian aircraft landings in the region.\n\nAI helps build \u2018patterns of life\u2019\n\nThe Baltic Sentry operation is backed up by AI run out of NATO\u2019s new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure in the UK.\n\n\u201cSpeed is of most importance here. We need to react very fast,\u201d the head of NATO maritime operations there, Capt. Niels Markussen, told CNN last week.\n\nAccording to Markussen, a Danish naval captain, the team is building \u201cpatterns of life\u201d in the Baltic, watching for anomalies, like ships frequently changing direction, loitering or slowing near critical cabling. \u201cWe have this picture of the undersea infrastructure, we compare that with the picture of the surface,\u201d he explained.\n\nWith the combined resources of warships, AI, high-tech tracking data and F-35 stealth fighter jets to call on, Markussen says reaction time to suspicious behavior will be \u201cwithin a half an hour or an hour\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the 17 hours for which one ship suspected of sabotage dragged its anchor last year.\n\nGerman minesweeper FGS Datteln has gone from combatting sea mines to detecting damage to undersea cables as part of the Baltic Sentry mission. Darren Bull/CNN\n\nBut with the speed and muscle of this new operation comes danger, Markussen says. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive because it is an area where we have to balance between this moving into something that can become very ugly \u2013 and what I mean by that is warfare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as blaming Russia, he says. \u201cAttribution is difficult,\u201d he explains, adding that \u201cthe proof, the smoking gun\u2026 It\u2019s, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nPevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister, whose country has deep historic reasons to fear Russia, and is weeks from disconnecting from a joint energy grid with its far larger eastern neighbor, is also cautious about attributing blame. \u201cWe have to stick to the rules and also to the legislation, because this is exactly what Putin wants to see,\u201d he says, referring to the need to build a watertight case to avoid Russia exploiting any doubts or loopholes.\n\nEven so, he says, \u201cit\u2019s not a surprise\u201d that the cable cutting came at this time, or in such an ambiguous way. Russia, he says, has form. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using the civil vessels all the time. So, we\u2019ve seen that their intelligence ships are marked as civil, let\u2019s say (for) academic purposes, or whatever. So, this is not a surprise for us.\u201d The Kremlin has previously rejected accusations it used civilian ships for gathering intelligence.\n\nPevkur sees the cable cutting as an extension of the war in Ukraine, saying Putin wants Western nations \u201cnot dealing with Ukraine and (instead) dealing with our own problems.\u201d\n\nUndersea drones being prepared by the crew of FGS Datteln. CNN\n\nSea drones survey murky depths\n\nAt sea, off his coast, the crew of the German minesweeper FGS Datteln is at the sharp end of Baltic Sentry.\n\nPerhaps more than any of the other crews and vessels in Baltic Sentry, they\u2019re transitioning from old-war methods of fighting to the skills of winning a hybrid war. The minesweeper has gone from combatting sea mines to detecting damage to undersea cables.\n\nA few feet above the icy water, on an open deck at the back of the aging warcraft, a rack of red sea drones is stacked up. Each one is about 8 feet (2.4 meters) long, powered by four slender thrusters, and requires three sailors to carefully maneuver it above the water before dropping it the last foot into the sea.\n\nTethered to the ship by thin orange cabling, wound on a hand-cranked drum, images are relayed from the murky ocean floor.\n\nWhat the drone operators see below the water, long before any repair crews are called in to fix a damaged cable, could be the trigger that tips diplomacy towards the action that Markussen fears.\n\nIf irrefutable evidence of Russian malfeasance is found, NATO will have moved another step closer to confronting its adversary.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAlexander Lukashenko, Europe\u2019s longest-serving leader, has extended his 31-year rule in Belarus after being declared the winner of a presidential election that his exiled opponents and Western countries have denounced as a sham.\n\nUnlike in 2020, when Lukashenko allowed an unusually competitive election and faced the greatest threat to his regime since he came to power in 1994, Sunday\u2019s result was never in doubt.\n\nIn this stage-managed affair, Lukashenko faced only token opposition, with one candidate admitting he was running merely \u201calongside\u201d the strongman leader, not instead of him. Official results released early Monday found Lukashenko had won in another landslide with 86.8% of the vote.\n\nThe result grants Lukashenko a seventh term in power and cements his grip on the former Soviet republic, a major Russian ally that has played a key role in Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine, from serving as a launching pad for its full-scale invasion in February 2022 to becoming a staging post for Russian tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nLukashenko\u2019s reliance on his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, has deepened since the last Belarusian election in 2020, when he faced an unexpectedly stiff challenge from Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a political novice who entered the race after her husband, Sergei, was jailed and prevented from running.\n\nAlthough official figures said Lukashenko won by a landslide in 2020, Tsikhanouskaya claimed victory and spearheaded huge protests, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets to demand the end of Lukashenko\u2019s regime.\n\nWith Moscow\u2019s backing, the regime responded brutally, imprisoning tens of thousands of protesters and driving Tsikhanouskaya and others into exile. According to Viasna, a Belarusian human rights group, the regime is still holding more than 1,200 political prisoners.\n\nThe crackdown was so brutal that Tsikhanouskaya, now living in neighboring Lithuania, declined to call for public protests this time round. Instead, she asked Belarusians simply to vote against all candidates on the heavily-vetted ballots. Her opposition movement called the vote a \u201ca meticulously orchestrated charade designed to perpetuate the illegitimate dictator\u2019s grip on power.\u201d\n\nLukashenko speaks to reporters after casting his ballot on January 26. Pavel Bednyakov/AP\n\nIn a lengthy news conference after casting his vote on Sunday, Lukashenko maintained that Belarus is a democracy because his rivals were given a choice. \u201cSome chose prison, others chose exile,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nLukashenko also told reporters that he did not care whether the West recognizes Belarus\u2019 election or not.\n\nKaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the vote was \u201cneither free nor fair,\u201d calling it \u201ca blatant affront to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin, however, hailed Lukashenko\u2019s victory. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping also congratulated him.\n\nThe 70-year-old Lukashenko has given little indication that he intends to step down, even after his seventh term, Nigel Gould-Davies, the former UK ambassador to Belarus, told CNN.\n\nGould-Davies, who is now a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that Lukashenko is unlikely to relinquish power on his own accord.\n\n\u201cDictators, even if they want to, fear stepping down voluntarily,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret weakness of autocracies.\u201d\n\nBefore Sunday\u2019s vote, Lukashenko mocked opposition leaders who he said were waiting for him to \u201cdrop dead,\u201d telling them: \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmong 34,000 people in the town of O\u015bwi\u0119cim is just one Jew \u2013 a young Israeli named Hila Weisz-Gut. It\u2019s an interesting choice of residence, given the most famous feature of the town is its proximity to the Nazi concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz \u2013 where at least 1.1 million people, mainly Jews, died between 1940 and 1945.\n\nNearly every member of Weisz-Gut\u2019s grandmother\u2019s family was lethally gassed there upon arrival in a cargo transport from Hungary. Today, Weisz-Gut can see Auschwitz III-Monowitz, where her grandmother survived, from her bedroom window.\n\nShe moved from Israel to join her Polish husband in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, his hometown, in 2023, fully aware of her own family\u2019s tragic history.\n\nWeisz-Gut said she often faces skepticism and even scorn from Jews and Israelis for her choice of residence. If her late grandmother knew her address, she told CNN, she \u201cwould turn over in her grave.\u201d But her neighbors in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, she explained, have been welcoming and kind, asking questions and wishing her a Shabbat Shalom, meaning peaceful Sabbath. \u201cI haven\u2019t had even one altercation that connected to antisemitism,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Weisz-Gut, maintaining a Jewish presence in the town \u2013 even if tiny \u2013 is vital. As the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the camp nears, on January 27, a disturbing trend is emerging across Europe, monitoring groups say \u2013 the rise of antisemitism.\n\nFactors in this may be anger over the war in Gaza and a growing far-right presence in some countries, where electoral successes have lent far-right politicians and their supporters a louder voice. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights said some organizations had reported a 400% increase in antisemitic incidents since the October 7, 2023 terror attacks in Israel.\n\n\u201cWe have observed that whenever there was or is a crisis in the Middle East, it led to a rise of antisemitic incidents in Europe,\u201d Nicole Romain, the agency\u2019s spokesperson, told CNN. \u201cOn average, 96% of Jews told us they have encountered antisemitism in their life, and 80% thought that it has been getting worse in recent years,\u201d she added.\n\nThe story of O\u015bwi\u0119cim, whose population was nearly 60% Jewish in 1939 before the Nazis arrived, serves as a stark reminder of what unbridled antisemitism can unleash.\n\nWeisz-Gut currently works at the town\u2019s Oshpitzin Jewish Museum, educating Israeli visitors about the region\u2019s once-vibrant Jewish community. The museum has said she is the only Jewish person living in O\u015bwi\u0119cim.\n\nHila Weisz-Gut is seen educating visitors at the Oshpitzin Jewish Museum in O\u015bwi\u0119cim. Kamil Gut\n\nSpeaking to CNN over recent months, Weisz-Gut explained that her grandmother never wanted to discuss her experiences during World War II. \u201cWhen I asked her about Auschwitz, she told me to get out of her house,\u201d she said.\n\nThis past year, living so close to Auschwitz has taken on greater significance for Weisz-Gut. On October 7, 2023 she sat horrorstruck as she watched social media videos of Israelis running for their lives at the Nova music festival after Hamas militants attacked. Her mother, who lives 10 minutes from the Lebanese border in northern Israel, has had to take refuge in an underground shelter amid strikes launched by Hezbollah.\n\nFar away in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, Weisz-Gut recalls, she felt intense fear. Alone, she went to the town\u2019s last active remaining synagogue to pray. \u201cI felt the need to open Aron Hakodesh, the holy ark,\u201d she explained to CNN. \u201cIt was devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, is it really happening again?\u201d\n\nSince the attack, Weisz-Gut has felt forced to take account of the specter of increasing prejudice in Europe on a personal level. While on a trip to London, she said, her mother and husband urged caution, suggesting she remove her Jewish star necklace. She also wore long sleeves to cover a tattoo in Hebrew. \u201cSince the war with Gaza, people don\u2019t separate between Jewish people and Israeli people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are no clear boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe Community Security Trust, a Jewish security charity, recorded 1,978 antisemitic incidents across the UK in the first half of 2024, a record high. A sharp uptick in anti-Muslim hate has also been reported in the UK since the October 7 attacks.\n\nFrance, which has the largest Jewish population in Europe, recently reported a sharp rise in antisemitism since October 7, with reported incidents increasing by 284%. In Germany, there has also been a steep increase in reported antisemitic crime, according to a government report, with greater incidence of violence.\n\nMuch of the problem occurs online and via social media. \u201cThe digital world is the Wild West. There are no rules, there is no law. There are almost no consequences,\u201d explained Dervi\u015f H\u0131zarc\u0131, the head of the board at KIgA, a Berlin-based organization whose international network, ENCATE, fights hatred and antisemitism. \u201cI think online hate is the biggest challenge after October 7.\u201d\n\nStill, Weisz-Gut remains committed to living a Jewish life in Europe, specifically in the town co-opted by the Nazis to create the largest death machine in modern history.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a statement that they tried to break us and exterminate us, but they failed,\u201d she said of her presence in a place so associated with the Nazi regime. \u201cWe are the generation that is here to say \u2018you didn\u2019t succeed. No more. Not again.\u2019\u201d",

Last year, the war economy likely grew faster than the United States and all major European economies. Unemployment is at a record low. And if the ballooning defense budget has cramped other spending, that\u2019s only temporary.\n\nThese statistics send a message to audiences at home and abroad, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. To the Russian public: \u201cWe\u2019re still standing.\u201d To Ukraine\u2019s allies: \u201cWe can outlast you.\u201d\n\nProjecting an image of Russia\u2019s economic strength has real-world consequences. Some in the West have questioned whether the sanctions imposed by Ukraine\u2019s backers \u2013 and dismissed by President Vladimir Putin as mere \u201clogistical hurdles\u201d \u2013 work at all. If they don\u2019t, why bother?\n\nBut other experts say this image of resilience is a mirage \u2013 one carefully curated by the Kremlin to make its adversaries think Russia\u2019s economy is in good shape. As the war nears its third anniversary, this mask is starting to slip.\n\nTo explain Russia\u2019s apparent economic might, analysts have turned to metaphor. Some have used the phrase \u201con steroids,\u201d to describe growth that is rapid, but unnatural and unsustainable.\n\n\u201c\u2018Steroids\u2019 is a good one, but it still produces some muscle. I wouldn\u2019t call this muscle,\u201d Ribakova told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s more like running around on cocaine.\u201d\n\nRussia may soon feel the pain after the party. Increasingly disgruntled Russian officials have warned that Russia\u2019s economy is hitting the limits of what it can produce, driving up prices. Inflation accelerated last year despite the central bank hiking interest rates to 21% in October, a two-decade high.\n\nWhile signing a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump said Russia\u2019s economy was a sign that the country was in \u201cbig trouble,\u201d and that Putin was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nEvidence of that trouble includes the impact of new sanctions, persistent labor shortages and signs of a credit bubble. Despite recent battlefield gains, analysts say Russia\u2019s worsening economic problems could bring Putin to the negotiating table sooner than expected and may make sanctions relief a more powerful bargaining chip for the West.\n\nShadow budget\n\nThroughout the war, the Kremlin has made extensive use of a strategy known as \u201creflexive control,\u201d aimed at shaping an adversary\u2019s perceptions in a way that leads the adversary \u2013 in this case, Ukraine\u2019s Western backers \u2013 to choose actions that benefit Russia.\n\nWeapons are a case in point. Every time the West has considered sending new technology to Ukraine \u2013 first, modern tanks, then fighter jets, then long-range weapons \u2013 the Kremlin has warned of dire consequences, potentially involving a nuclear strike. This has slowed the supply of weapons to Kyiv, benefiting Moscow.\n\nThe economy is no different. The Kremlin wants to convince Ukraine\u2019s allies, particularly the United States, of Russia\u2019s economic strength. If Russia can fund its war for years, the US might support a ceasefire that favors the Kremlin\u2019s goals. Controlling perceptions is paramount, observers say.\n\nAnd so, it helps to boast of Russia\u2019s economic might. At his marathon annual press conference last month, Putin said Russia\u2019s economy was growing \u201cin spite of everything,\u201d outstripping Europe and the US.\n\nAn electronic screen in Moscow shows Putin and shares a New Year's message, January 7, 2025. Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEconomic growth and low unemployment have become Putin\u2019s \u201ctrump cards,\u201d Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote recently.\n\nBut these headline numbers conceal concerning trends. Russia is hiding the true cost of its war by using a shadow \u201coff-budget financing scheme,\u201d according to a new report by Craig Kennedy, an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.\n\nWhile Russia\u2019s \u201chighly scrutinized\u201d defense budget remains at sustainable levels, there has been a parallel and \u201clargely overlooked\u201d surge in corporate borrowing. These loans look private but really are disguised state spending, Kennedy wrote.\n\nOn February 25, 2022 \u2013 day 2 of the full-scale invasion \u2013 Russia enacted a law that empowers the state to force banks to lend to businesses providing goods and services for the war on terms set by the state, he noted.\n\nBetween the middle of that year and late 2024, Russia saw an \u201canomalous\u201d 71% surge in private credit, by an amount equal to 19.4% of its gross domestic product, according to Kennedy. He estimates up to 60% of these loans (as much as $249 billion) have been made to war-related firms. \u201cThese are loans that the state has compelled banks to extend to largely uncreditworthy, war-related businesses on concessionary terms,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis means Russia is spending almost twice as much on the war as official figures indicate, Kennedy noted.\n\nThe funding scheme could lead to a far-reaching credit crisis, he warned, in large part by imposing heavy debt loads on war-related companies that are likely to default over time, which risks overwhelming banks with \u201ca wave of toxic debt.\u201d\n\nSavers\u2019 jitters\n\nKennedy\u2019s analysis has provoked a range of responses. A Financial Times commentary said it showed Putin was sitting on a \u201cticking financial time bomb.\u201d\n\nOthers are more temperate. Prokopenko and Alexander Kolyandr, a scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, have also disputed some of Kennedy\u2019s findings, writing this month that fears of a banking crisis are \u201coverblown.\u201d\n\nTymofiy Mylovanov, head of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine\u2019s former economy minister, said the findings were concerning, but not necessarily destructive.\n\n\u201cThe conditions for a crisis are there \u2013 but is the trigger?\u201d he told CNN.\n\nOne such trigger could be panic among ordinary Russians, who know how it feels to have their savings wiped out. If they believe their deposits are at risk, this could spark bank runs.\n\nSince the fall, rumors have swirled that the central bank could freeze customers\u2019 deposits, which have ballooned as savers have rushed to profit from high interest rates. The Bank of Russia has called the idea \u201cabsurd.\u201d But this has done little to reassure Russians, Mylovanov said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are talking about it is a sign of trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot not talk about it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Russia\u2019s New People party, Alexei Nechayev, has proposed a new law to prevent the central bank from freezing customers\u2019 deposits without the Duma\u2019s consent.\n\nRussia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina attends the VTB Investment Forum in Moscow, December 4, 2024. Yuri Kochetkov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the central bank tries to inspire confidence, some are voicing doubts about its governor, Elvira Nabiullina. Although she was credited with saving the economy at the war\u2019s outset, some of Russia\u2019s elite have since turned on her. The head of the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec said the central bank\u2019s high key interest rate was hampering exports, while the chair of oil giant Gazprom Neft said expensive credit could impact companies providing services to the oil industry, raising \u201cserious concerns.\u201d\n\nEven Putin, a longtime supporter of Nabiullina, made a muted complaint during his year-end press conference, saying the central bank could have used instruments other than interest rate hikes and acted \u201cmore efficiently and at an earlier stage.\u201d\n\nHeadwinds\n\nEven without a credit crisis, Russia\u2019s economy faces serious headwinds in 2025.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Russian GDP grew 3.8% in 2024, but forecasts just 1.4% growth this year.\n\nPutin recently conceded that \u201cthe amount of products has not grown as much as consumption has\u201d \u2013 a classic recipe for price rises. Inflation accelerated to 9.5% last year, from 7.4% in 2023. Some supermarkets locked butter in cabinets to prevent thefts.\n\nAlthough wages are up, this reflects problems in the labor market. Putin boasts of Russia\u2019s record-low 2.3% unemployment rate, but this sword is double-edged. Low unemployment means higher wages, as Russian companies \u2013 short of 1.6 million skilled workers \u2013 must pay more to attract labor.\n\nThe war has played a part in the labor shortage: Ukraine\u2019s top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Sunday that Russian forces had suffered more than 434,000 casualties last year \u2013 150,000 of whom were killed in action. And since the start of the war, Russia has sustained more than 800,000 casualties, according to Ukraine\u2019s military estimates. UK and US estimates are slightly lower than the Ukrainian count. CNN cannot independently verify the figures.\n\nRussia could offset this by encouraging immigration, but Central Asian migrants \u2013 long used to plug gaps in the workforce \u2013 have faced rising xenophobia after recent terror attacks in Russia stoked ethnic tensions.\n\nGazprom's gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region in 2023. Alexander Manzyuk/Reuters\n\nMost importantly, Western sanctions are beginning to inflict serious pain. A package announced by the Biden administration in its final days targeted Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2013 aging oil tankers used to dodge earlier sanctions on Russia\u2019s oil exports. Dozens of these ships have dropped anchor around the world, unable to dock and unload due to the new measures. China and India \u2013 whose oil and gas purchases from Russia have helped fund its war \u2013 are reportedly looking for other suppliers.\n\nKyiv\u2019s refusal to renew a gas transit agreement that allowed Russian gas to flow through Ukraine will cost Gazprom up to $5 billion a year in sales, Reuters has reported. The energy giant posted a loss of almost $7 billion in 2023 \u2013 its first in nearly 25 years \u2013 and is considering axing more than 1,500 jobs. Less money for Gazprom means less for Russia\u2019s war chest.\n\nThe growing economic strain is causing Russia\u2019s social contract to creak, said Prokopenko, the Carnegie fellow.\n\n\u201cThe population no longer expects justice from the Kremlin; instead, they expect financial support,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nWith this support \u201cdwindling\u201d \u2013 as war spending eats into budgets for other services \u2013 Prokopenko warned there was now \u201ca clear divergence between the expectations of the population and the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to deliver.\u201d\n\nMoscow cannot keep financing the war and the regular economy at the same time as maintaining broader economic stability, she said. Although the Kremlin has so far fudged all three, something may soon have to give.",

                "text": "Kyiv CNN \u2014\n\nUS President Donald Trump\u2019s policy on Ukraine is a little scattered and meandering, and at times misinformed. But be in no doubt that it exists and seems an unanticipated priority.\n\nTrump\u2019s policy on Ukraine distinguishes itself in two ways in the first week of his administration.\n\nThe first is his persistent criticism of the economic damage the Kremlin head is doing to Russia. Trump is making a business case for a peace deal, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin he needs to make a pact for financial reasons.\n\nThis may misread Putin\u2019s apparent pathological commitment to victory, and the broad existential nature of the conflict for Moscow in the eyes of its propagandists. They see this as a war against the entirety of NATO that they must win. The propaganda taps of Russian state media can be turned off as well as on. But Russia\u2019s mindset is radicalized where the West\u2019s is not. It\u2019s not a business case of quarterly profit and loss for the Kremlin, but one of survival.\n\nThe second is how regularly Trump talks of the war after excluding it \u2014 and any mention of Ukraine and Russia \u2014 from his inauguration speech on Monday. He correctly suggested Thursday a lower oil price could impede Russia\u2019s ability to wage war. Russia sells oil to China and India to keep its war machine going, despite sanctions aimed at reducing its revenue.\n\nTrump said he would talk to North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whose troops are fighting for Moscow now in Kursk. He also correctly suggested Beijing has great influence over Moscow and could force a peace deal upon them.\n\nAgain, Trump is approaching the conflict from his comfort zone: one where everyone is seeking a smooth deal that makes them richer. China may seek calm, and perhaps ultimately wish the Ukraine conflict had never begun. But that is not the reality of now, and instead Xi Jinping is treading a delicate path: watching his ally Moscow degrade their military and economy to the extent they become Beijing\u2019s junior partner, while also realising Russia cannot lose the fight without a knock-on impact to China\u2019s global ambitions.\n\nThe calculations made now by America\u2019s adversaries concern the world order over the coming decade, not the immediate telephone call sheet of the White House, or how fast slick interpersonal dealings might wrap up the biggest land conflict in Europe since the 1940s.\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated call for NATO\u2019s European members to pay more for defense - an unlikely demand of 2% of GDP rising to 5% \u2013 has even been echoed by Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nUkrainian soldiers of 111th brigade operate an American Humvee fitted with a Soviet era Grad launcher in Donetsk, Ukraine, on Thursday. Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nIt is correct to state this is Europe\u2019s war. If Kyiv loses, Poland, the Baltics, Romania and Moldova will feel the heat, not Florida or California. Even NATO\u2019s head, Mark Rutte, has suggested Europe might buy arms for Ukraine from the United States. Trump was always going to challenge the cost of the war to Washington, and speedily Europe is being backed into a corner to step up.\n\nIt is also intriguing to see Trump talk of the damage the war has done. He said incorrectly Thursday millions had died on both sides. Kyiv has said 43,000 Ukrainian troops have died. The UN says about 12,000 Ukrainian civilians have died.\n\nWestern officials say regularly Russia\u2019s losses amount to 700,000 dead and injured, and independent media have tracked nearly 100,000 public records that suggest Russian military deaths on the battlefield.\n\nYet Trump\u2019s incorrect, emotional reference to millions may be aimed at evoking the urgency and horror of the war in the minds of an American audience for whom it is a side issue rarely discussed.\n\nTrump said he could bring peace to Ukraine in 24 hours, which was always a wild rhetorical exaggeration. Even the six months now evoked is optimistic. But he has taken office seized with a wobbly yet vivid grasp of the war\u2019s issues. That may falter, as he slowly realizes a deal is not low hanging fruit and his adversaries \u2013 because that is what Putin is, however \u201cgreat\u201d Trump says they get along \u2013 are more patient, enduring and conniving than he is.\n\nBut his opening week has done much to dispel the greater fear from Ukraine and its allies that Trump preferred coziness with Putin to NATO\u2019s unity. Or that his wild and unrealistic promises of diplomacy from the campaign trail would evaporate \u2013 along with funding for the war \u2013 the moment he came to office. This may all still happen, and the road ahead for Trump is deeply complex and fraught with rivals who have years more experience in the job, and much more to lose or gain.\n\nBut Trump is seized of the issue, has an emotional albeit shaky grasp of the war\u2019s horrors, and is critical of, not fawning towards, Putin. It\u2019s yet another unforeseen turn in a conflict ruled by the unexpected.",

                "text": "Jerusalem CNN \u2014\n\nUS President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to \u201cclean out\u201d the Gaza Strip by moving more than a million Palestinians to neighboring countries has drawn sharp criticism, with opponents condemning it as ethnic cleansing and warning of regional chaos.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that he would like Jordan and Egypt to take in Gazans internally displaced by Israel\u2019s devastating war in the enclave. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nThe potential transfer, he said, \u201ccould be temporary\u201d or \u201ccould be long-term.\u201d Both countries swiftly rejected the idea.\n\nBut, if adopted, the proposal would mark a sharp break from the Biden administration\u2019s stance that Gaza should not be depopulated and could signal a shift from a longstanding US position that Gaza should be part of a future Palestinian state. It would also align the Trump administration with Israel\u2019s most radical far-right politicians, who advocate transferring Palestinians out of the territory to make way for Jewish settlement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travels from Las Vegas to Miami on Saturday. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal has been embraced by extremist Israeli politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich \u2013 who has sparked controversy by claiming there is \u201cno such thing as a Palestinian people\u201d\u2013 and former Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who was once convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism.\n\nPalestinian politicians decried it as a plan to ethnically cleanse Gazans from their land.\n\nAnd in the United States, even Senator Lindsey Graham \u2013 one of Israel\u2019s most ardent supporters in Congress \u2013 told CNN in an interview he didn\u2019t believe the idea was \u201coverly practical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Graham said, referring to Trump.\n\nExperts warn that beyond the moral and legal concerns, an influx of refugees into neighboring Arab countries could destabilize them and pose an existential threat. Agreeing to Trump\u2019s proposal, they say, would provoke widespread public anger \u2013 an untenable risk for those governments.\n\n\u2018A second Palestinian Nakba\u2019\n\n\u201cIf they were to\u2026 accept being participants in and hosting Palestinians in an ethnic cleansing, that would undoubtedly be infuriating and genuinely destabilizing for both countries,\u201d Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN.\n\nBoth the Egyptian and Jordanian governments \u201cwould be met by sweeping domestic opposition if they were seen by their publics as being complacent with a second Palestinian Nakba,\u201d said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, referring to 1948, when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes in historic Palestine, during the creation of Israel.\n\nIsrael has barred them and their descendants from returning, leaving millions of refugees in neighboring countries without citizenship or prospects for permanent resettlement.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Palestinians of Gaza are highly unlikely to leave voluntarily, a forced displacement towards Egypt or Jordan would pose a variety of existential threats to these two countries,\u201d Alhasan said.\n\nFor Jordan, which is already home to millions of Palestinians, an altered demographic \u201cwould threaten the Hashemite monarchy\u2019s hold on power,\u201d he said, adding that financially, \u201cneither Egypt nor Jordan can afford to host millions of additional refugees.\u201d\n\nDisplaced Gazans returning toward Gaza City on January 27. AFP/Getty Images\n\nEgypt and Jordan are two of the US\u2019 closest allies in the Middle East, and major recipients of US aid that have for decades aligned their regional policies with US interests. They were the first Arab countries to sign peace treaties with Israel and have maintained cordial relations with it, including security coordination, despite widespread public discontent.\n\nJane Kinninmont, an expert on conflict at the European Leadership Network, a think tank, and co-host of the Disorder podcast, said that over time, Jordan and Egypt\u2019s influence in Washington, DC has been overshadowed by Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. What remains to be seen, she added, is how far those countries will go in \u201csending a clear message to Washington that mass displacement won\u2019t make the conflict go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important for regional countries to emphasize that the refugee issue is one of the drivers of the current conflict and making more Palestinians into refugees won\u2019t solve that. This goes right to the heart of the conflict,\u201d Kinninmont said.\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nOn Sunday, both Egypt and Jordan reaffirmed their rejection to the deportation or resettlement of Palestinians.\n\n\u201cJordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,\u201d said Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in a news conference in Amman Sunday. \u201cOur rejection for the deportation is steadfast and unchanging.\u201d\n\nEgypt\u2019s foreign ministry also said it rejects \u201cthe deportation or encouragement of the transfer or removal of Palestinians from their land.\u201d\n\nThroughout the war, Jordan and Egypt have brushed off domestic calls to sever ties with Israel, and Egypt has played a key mediation role between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn October 2023, protests erupted in both countries in support of Palestinians in Gaza, with many showing disgruntlement with their governments\u2019 cooperation with Israel given the high human toll Israel\u2019s war had taken.\n\nKaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that accepting a Palestinian population transfer would be more costly for the two countries than losing the American aid both countries rely on.\n\nEgypt and Jordan already host a sizeable number of refugees.\n\nCars drive along a street in the Palestinian refugee camp of Baqa'a near Amman, Jordan in May 2024. Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs of January, there were 877,000 refugees and asylum-seekers registered in Egypt, according to the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. In May, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, Diab al-Louh, has said as many as 100,000 Gazans had crossed into Egypt since the war began, according to Reuters.\n\nIn Jordan, more than 2.39 million Palestine refugees are registered with UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the agency said.\n\nBoth countries may also have security concerns if their territories become staging grounds for attacks on Israel, said Alhasan. That could further strain their peace treaties with Israel, he said.\n\n\u201cBy seeking to depopulate Gaza of its Palestinian inhabitants, Trump\u2026 is doing the bidding of Israel\u2019s extreme right-wing fanatics,\u201d Alhasan said.\n\n\u201cIronically, Trump\u2019s proposal, if it were to materialize, would in fact be self-defeating,\u201d he said. Destabilizing Egypt and Jordan would \u201cfavor Islamist political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d and these would \u201cprove far less friendly to the US and more sympathetic to Hamas.\u201d",

                "text": "Tel Aviv, Israel CNN \u2014\n\nThe fragility of the truce between Israel and Hamas was laid bare on Saturday, after Israel accused Hamas of withholding a hostage, prompting a halt in the movement of Gazan civilians back to their homes in the north.\n\nThe ceasefire deal was already a brittle agreement, with Israeli statements often calling it a \u201cframework\u201d as opposed to a deal.\n\nTensions escalated this week when 29-year-old Arbel Yehud, a civilian who Israel says should have been freed Saturday, was not among the four women released. Israel, in turn, did not allow Gazan civilians to return north past the Netzarim Corridor, which was meant to take place Saturday under the ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nComplicating the matter is that Yehud is not being held by Hamas. A senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ), another militant group in the Strip, told CNN that it is holding Yehud and that she \u201cwill be released under the terms of the agreed-upon prisoner exchange deal.\u201d\n\nBoth Hamas and Israel have accused the other of failing to stick to their end of the bargain, raising questions about how well the ceasefire that took more than 15 months to reach would hold.\n\n\u201cThis is a very delicate matter,\u201d Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who used to speak to Hamas through backchannels, told CNN.\n\nBaskin explained that Hamas \u201cwill not give anything for free,\u201d in reference to Yehud\u2019s captivity. He added that \u201cIsrael\u2019s threat not to allow the displaced to move north\u201d does little to convince Hamas to help push for her release.\n\nThe former negotiator warned that \u201ccarrying out the threat\u201d of not allowing displaced Palestinians to move north \u201ccould lead to a halt in the release of the hostages\u201d and advised Israel to try to keep the deal alive.\n\n\u201cIt is better for Israel to talk less and let the mediators do more,\u201d Baskin added, urging Israel to \u201cconvey to Qatar and Egypt that it is ready to adopt the three-week deal that Hamas agreed to in September.\n\n\u2018How will the US respond?\u2019\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Saturday that \u201cHamas didn\u2019t fulfil the agreement in terms of its obligation to return civilians first,\u201d adding that \u201cwe will insist that Arbel Yehud return\u201d along with the rest of the hostages.\n\nHundreds of displaced people were seen fleeing in panic after the Israeli military opened fire on Saturday to prevent them from crossing into northern Gaza to return to their homes, CNN footage showed. The Israeli military said it was \u2018unaware of any harm\u2019 after its troops fired \u2018warning shots in order to distance\u2019 a crowd in Gaza.\n\nHamas said that Israel \u201ccontinues to procrastinate in implementing the terms of the ceasefire agreement and the prisoner exchange by maintaining the closure of al-Rasheed Street and preventing the return of displaced persons walking from the south to the north.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian militant group added that it holds Israel \u201cresponsible for any delays in the implementation of the agreement and the repercussions that may arise on the remaining phases.\u201d\n\nThere are questions as to how the United States under President Donald Trump would respond to the violations alleged by both sides.\n\nGazans hoping to return to their homes in northern Gaza take cover after the Israeli military opened fire to prevent them from crossing into the area on Saturday, January 25. CNN\n\nAn Israeli official told CNN Saturday that Israel asked the Trump administration to push on Hamas to abide by the terms of the deal and free Yehud. The message was sent to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, the official added. CNN has reached out to Trump administration for comment.\n\nThe ceasefire \u201cframework,\u201d as Israel refers to it, \u201cwas hardly ironclad from the get-go,\u201d Dr H.A. Hellyer, senior associate fellow at Center for American Progress and the Royal United Services Institute, told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe question is now, after clear violations by the Israelis, how will the US respond? Will they use pressure to ensure adherence, or are we seeing the breakdown of this pause in hostilities so soon after the signing?\u201d Hellyer said.\n\nA choreographed show of force\n\nTensions simmered as the second exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners took place. The militant group used it to choreograph a poignant show of force despite Israel\u2019s warnings.\n\nPropaganda video released by Hamas after the four Israeli hostages were freed showed the women paraded before a crowd as they received certificates for their release and souvenir keychains. CNN does not know the circumstances under which the hostages were speaking, including whether they were speaking under duress.\n\nIn the nearly three-minute video, the four women are seen seated inside a van, smiling and posing. The women were seen thanking Hamas\u2019 military wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, \u201cfor the good treatment,\u201d including for providing food and water. They also thanked them for \u201cprotecting\u201d them from shelling.\n\nNone of the four women are native Arabic speakers. In the video, they can be heard speaking in Hebrew accents.\n\nHamas\u2019 propaganda videos have left a sour note over the years. Previous Hamas\u2019 videos of the four soldiers\u2019 kidnapping by Hamas on October 7, 2023 had gone viral. The women were dressed in civilian clothes at the time of their taking, including pajamas when they were pulled from their bedrooms. Videos showed them covered in blood.\n\nFour Israeli hostages wave on a stage before Hamas fighters hand them over to a team from the Red Cross in Gaza City on January 25, 2025. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nExperts say that deals like this are bound to be filled with complications, especially as Hamas tries to use what leverage it has over Israel, and as Israel tries to retrieve hostages while destroying the group.\n\nYohanan Tzoreff, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, said concerns about violations, delays, or crises come with \u201cany deal with an organization like Hamas.\u201d\n\nSuch concerns \u201care rooted in the many past grievances between the two sides, numerous bloody conflicts, and, of course, the heinous attack carried out by Hamas on October 7,\u201d Tzoreff said.\n\n\u201cThe issue of hostage release became a test for both sides,\u201d he said, adding that Israel \u201cfinds itself facing a dilemma: how to secure the hostages\u2019 release while fully achieving the second goal of dismantling Hamas.\u201d",

They appeared elated as they waved to the crowds, with Israelis visibly emotional as they watched the live pictures in Hostages Square, Tel Aviv.\n\nHamas put on show of force during the handover, waving green flags and displaying a poster of current and former Israeli leaders alongside the word \u201cfailure,\u201d in what seemed to be a message to Israeli that it remained powerful despite being battered by the Gaza offensive.\n\nSoon after the releases, the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that civilians in Gaza would not be allowed to move to their homes in northern Gaza as planned \u2013 because an Israeli female civilian due to be released Saturday was not among those freed.\n\nIsraelis celebrate as they follow the news of the hostages' release, in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday. Ariel Schalit/AP\n\nPalestinian Hamas militants parade before the handover of four female hostages in Gaza City on Saturday. Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters\n\nIsrael has been pushing for the release of Arbel Yehud, 29, who was kidnapped from her home in kibbutz Nir Oz. Israel says she is a civilian and should have been released Saturday.\n\nIsrael asked the administration of US President Donald Trump to press Hamas to abide by the terms of the deal and free Yehud, an Israeli official familiar with the matter told CNN Saturday.\n\nIsrael conveyed the message to Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, the official added. CNN has reached out to the Trump administration for comment.\n\nA senior source in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement (PIJ) told CNN on Saturday that it holds Yehud, claiming she was a soldier and \u201cwas being held captive by (the PIJ\u2019s military wing) al-Quds Brigades as a trained soldier in the Israeli army\u2019s space program.\u201d There is no evidence that Yehud has had such a role.\n\nA second PIJ source outside Gaza told CNN that Yehud was alive.\n\nAn Israeli official confirmed to CNN that the Israeli military would not allow Gazan civilians to cross into the north until Yehud was in the hands of Israel or until the process of her release starts.\n\nIsraeli military fires towards Palestinians attempting to return home\n\nHundreds of displaced people hoping to return to their homes in the north fled in panic after the Israeli military opened fire to prevent them from crossing into northern Gaza, CNN footage shows.\n\nThe Israeli military had warned people earlier in the day that they could not travel north past the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 which divides the territory \u2013 as planned, saying that Hamas had failed to release Yehud during the latest hostage release.\n\nIn anticipation of being allowed to return, scores of families had gathered at Al Rasheed street \u2013 the coastal road to the north. But amid gunfire they scattered, many ducking to the ground. It is unclear whether there were any casualties.\n\nThe Israeli military said its troops \u201conly fired warning shots\u201d after they identified dozens of \u201csuspects that posed a threat to the forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe emphasize that, as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting,\u201d it added.\n\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari earlier said the four hostages released Saturday had been reunited with their families. The family of Daniella Gilboa expressed their joy at her release from Gaza.\n\n\u201cWe just want to hug her, to see her and hug her. And to say to her that she is safe now and everybody is waiting for her,\u201d Gilboa\u2019s aunt, Dekele Sherabi, told CNN.\n\nAfter reuniting with family, the four soldiers were transported from Re\u2019im in southern Israel to Beilinson hospital, arriving in two separate military helicopters. A few hundred Israelis gathered around the helipad near the hospital to receive them.\n\nA white curtain was raised for the hostages\u2019 privacy as they moved from the helicopters to the vans that would carry them inside the medical facility.\n\nEmotional scenes as Palestinian prisoners are released\n\nThe Israeli prison service confirmed Saturday that 200 Palestinian prisoners had been released from detention facilities as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nThey included 121 prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. Among them were Mohammad Odeh, Wael Qassim and Wissam Abbasi, who were arrested in 2002 for a string of deadly bombings targeting Israelis in crowded civilian areas. All three were serving life sentences for their involvement in the attacks.\n\nAccording to a list published by the Palestinian Prisoners Office and the Palestinian Prisoners Society, nearly half of the released prisoners are men in their 20s and 30s. Two children \u2013 both 15 years old \u2013 were also freed, according to the list.\n\nThe documents do not mention on what grounds the individuals were detained but did list party affiliation \u2013 including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nMost of the Palestinians who were freed were transported to the occupied West Bank but 70 of the detainees considered to be dangerous by Israel are being deported outside of Israel and Palestinian territories, according to the Israeli prison service.\n\nEmotional scenes played out in the streets of Ramallah, in the West Bank, following the prisoners\u2019 release.\n\nPrisoners wearing grey tracksuits and blue gloves were lifted onto the shoulders of supporters in celebration of their new freedom, video footage showed. Some waved the Palestinian flag, while others were visibly relieved as they embraced members of the crowd.",

The Israeli security cabinet met Thursday night to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cAll parties share the goal of ensuring Hezbollah does not have the ability to threaten the Lebanese people or their neighbors,\u201d the US National Security Council spokesperson said, adding, \u201cTo achieve these goals, a short, temporary ceasefire extension is urgently needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the IDF has started the withdrawal from the central regions, and we continue to work closely with our regional partners to finalize the extension,\u201d he added.\n\nMichael Herzog, Israel\u2019s ambassador in Washington, told Israel\u2019s Army Radio on Thursday that a 60-day deadline set out in a November ceasefire agreement \u201cis not set in stone.\u201d\n\nAn Israeli official who described Israel\u2019s request to the US said Israel has requested a 30-day extension and has said it would re-assess the viability of withdrawing from southern Lebanon at the end of that extension. The official said all of the outposts Israel has asked to maintain are alongside the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nUnder the deal, the Lebanese military and UN peacekeepers will be the only forces allowed in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah must pull its forces north of Lebanon\u2019s Litani River \u2013 a frontier beyond which the militant group was not supposed to have advanced under a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution.\n\n\u201cThat is not yet the case,\u201d Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said of Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal and the Lebanese military\u2019s deployment in a briefing Thursday. \u201cThere is movement, but it is not moving fast enough.\u201d\n\nHezbollah warned on Thursday that an Israeli breach of the agreement would require the Lebanese state \u201cto deal with it by every means at its disposal afforded to it by international treaties in order to retrieve the land and snatch it from the clutches of occupation.\u201d\n\nUS sees \u2018a very positive path\u2019\n\nThere has for some time been speculation in Israel that the government would seek to change the terms of its ceasefire with Hezbollah once Trump took office.\n\nThe exact situation in southern Lebanon is decidedly opaque. The Israeli military has spent these past months of the ceasefire feverishly destroying Hezbollah weapons and military infrastructure and leveling several Lebanese villages near the border. Hezbollah\u2019s military posture is unclear.\n\nThe clearest picture has been painted by the US military, which together with the French government and the United Nations is monitoring the ceasefire.\n\nUS Major General Jasper Jeffers, who leads the American effort, said after a trip to southern Lebanon last week that Lebanese military \u201ccheckpoints and patrols operate effectively throughout south-west Lebanon.\u201d He said that the belligerents were \u201con a very positive path to continue the withdrawal of the IDF as planned.\u201d\n\nLebanese soldiers inspect a residential area that was devastated during fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, in the southern coastal town of Naqura, on Wednesday. Anwar Amro/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, Lebanon\u2019s parliament elected Joseph Aoun, supported by the US and formerly the military chief, as president. It ended more than two years of stalemate that had resulted in a presidential vacuum. The election was brought about by a robust Saudi effort to rally the necessary support for Aoun.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, viewed as a blueprint for a six-year tenure, Aoun vowed to monopolize weapons under the mandate of the state. It was an earth-shattering promise, marking a clear break with the decades-old unwritten policy to preserve Hezbollah\u2019s militant wing which has de facto been tasked with facing off against Israeli forces.\n\nThe American optimism over the ceasefire is not shared by many civilians from northern Israel, who have been slow to return to communities emptied by war. Residents of Kiryat Shmona are set to demonstrate against the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMost communities are still empty,\u201d Sarit Zehavi, who runs the Alma Research and Education Center, which specializes in security issues in northern Israel. \u201cPeople want to come back.\u201d\n\nThere is a widespread fear in northern Israel, she said, that military withdrawal will give Hezbollah carte blanche to deploy close to Israel\u2019s border, under the nose of the Lebanese military.\n\n\u201cThe Lebanese army is far from disarming Hezbollah,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are very worried what will happen if the IDF fully withdraws and the IDF enforcement will stop, because we don\u2019t see the Lebanese army doing anything.\u201d",

CNN\n\nIsrael launched the operation two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began, saying it was aimed at eliminating \u201cterrorists and terror infrastructure\u201d and \u201censuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over \u2013 the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Israeli military said it had killed \u201cmore than 10 terrorists, arrested about 20 wanted individuals, and confiscated many other weapons and ammunition\u201d during its operation in Jenin.\n\nBut rights groups have raised concerns that fleeing civilians have been caught in the crossfire.\n\nSome of those now fleeing the camp said Israeli drones carrying loudspeakers had ordered them to leave, then guided them out.\n\nMousa Al-Sharaa, 45, fled Thursday with his elderly mother, who he had to carry at times as they left the camp on foot.\n\nThe streets were empty as they left and the Israeli army was \u201cspread around everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nSome residents said the military had told them they could return in seven days. Others said troops had told them they could not return at all.\n\nAsked if he would return, Al-Sharaa said soldiers had warned him against the idea.\n\n\u201cThey told us: don\u2019t come back, we\u2019ll make a boom out of the whole camp,\u201d he said.\n\nKhawla Asaad, 55, who was born in the camp, said she had evacuated four days ago amid heavy gunfire and was now staying with a friend nearby.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians outside Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Friday. CNN\n\nThere had been no water or electricity for days before she left, she said, adding that most other people had left too.\n\nJenin governor Kamal Abu Al-Roub told CNN Thursday the camp was now nearly empty, that water had been cut off and the area was \u201cunder siege.\u201d\n\nAs the Israeli operation continued into its fourth day, Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, said the commission was deeply concerned by the \u201cuse of unlawful lethal force\u201d in Jenin, including \u201cmultiple airstrikes and apparently random shooting at unarmed residents attempting to flee or find safety.\u201d\n\nThe UNHCR said it had verified that at least 12 Palestinians had been killed and 40 injured by Israeli security forces since Tuesday, most of them reportedly unarmed.\n\nElsewhere in the West Bank, the UN said, Israeli security forces had \u201cshut down entrances to major Palestinian cities such as Hebron, closed checkpoints, and initiated long, individual searches of vehicles at those that remained open.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, the Israeli military occupied the camp after 10 days of intensive fighting, according to the UN, during which time more than 400 houses were destroyed and over a quarter of the camp\u2019s population was displaced.",

                "text": "GOMA, Congo Associated Press \u2014\n\nThousands fled the city of Goma on Monday as fighting raged between Congolese forces and rebels backed by neighboring Rwanda, who claimed to have captured eastern Congo\u2019s largest regional hub.\n\nPockets of chaos and gunfire had some people hunkering down as the rebels marched into the city with a population of about 2 million. Others hurried to safer areas of the province; some applauded and cheered on the rebels from the roadside, even shaking hands with them. Many, however, tried to flee into neighboring Rwanda, marching in the heat and through the night along roads with heavy traffic, clinging to their babies, clothes and other belongings on their backs and heads.\n\nGoma is a key location in the conflict-battered North Kivu province whose minerals are critical to much of the world\u2019s technology. Rebel groups have long fought over control of eastern Congo\u2019s mineral wealth, and the conflict has often pitted ethnic groups against one another, with civilians forced to flee their homes and seek protection from armed groups.\n\nThe Congolese government confirmed the presence of M23 rebels in Goma, 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) east of capital Kinshasa, but stopped short of saying they were in control of the city. In a statement on X, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya asked Goma residents to stay at home and also urged Congolese nationals around the world to mobilize in support of the country. \u201cNo centimeter will be given up!!!\u201d Muyaya wrote.\n\nA fire at the city\u2019s Munzenze prison on Monday morning resulted in the escape of thousands of inmates. \u201cAll the prisoners who were detained came out, whether women, men or minors, everyone came out,\u201d said Mwamisyo Ndungo, one of the escapees who estimated that more than 2,000 fled the facility.\n\nThe M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in a decades-long conflict, one of Africa\u2019s largest. The rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012, before they were forced to pull out under international pressure, and resurfaced in late 2021, with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo\u2019s government and United Nations experts. Rwanda has denied such support.\n\nRwanda\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Congo of failing to enter a dialogue with M23, which it described as a \u201cCongolese rebel group fighting to protect their community.\u201d That failure, it said, has prolonged the fighting that continues to present \u201ca serious threat to Rwanda\u2019s security and territorial integrity, and necessitates Rwanda\u2019s sustained defensive posture.\u201d\n\nThe advance into Goma is the culmination of a prolonged battle between the rebels and the Congolese security forces that saw several towns along the Rwandan border falling to the insurgents.\n\nAnalysts have warned the latest escalation could further destabilize the region, which is already home to one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises with more than 6 million people displaced, including more than a third of North Kivu\u2019s population.\n\nA regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts, Goma\u2019s airport, which is key for transporting supplies, has been shut following the fighting.\n\nRwanda\u2019s state television also showed several Congolese soldiers surrendering in the Rwandan town of Rubavu after crossing the border from Goma.\n\nA UN armored personnel carrier burns during clashes with M23 rebels outside Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, on Jan. 25, 2025. Moses Sawasawa/AP\n\nUN and other countries call on the rebels to withdraw\n\nAfter an emergency meeting late Sunday, the UN Security Council issued a statement calling on the M23 to immediately reverse its advances. Other countries including the United States, United Kingdom and France have also condemned the rebel push.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Security Council condemned the ongoing flagrant disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC,\u201d the UN statement added, referring to Congo\u2019s formal name, the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nCongolese government officials have said the country is \u201cin a war situation\u201d and accused Rwanda of committing \u201ca frontal aggression (and) a declaration of war.\u201d Congo cut ties with Rwanda over the weekend as recent attempts at diplomatic talks between the two countries failed.\n\nRwanda has denied claims it has prolonged the conflict. Rwanda accuses Congo of enlisting and fighting alongside Hutu rebels and former militiamen responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a group formed by the Hutus who fled to Congo after the killings.\n\nResidents seek safety across the border in Rwanda\n\nThe M23 rebels\u2019 march towards Goma threw the city into chaos, from hospitals overstretched with injured residents to internally displacement camps being hit amid intensified shelling that forced displaced families to once again grab what was left of their belongings before loading them alongside their children into cramped vehicles and scooters.\n\nAs some residents remained indoors worried for their safety, hundreds including children on Monday trekked for hours to other parts of North Kivu and to cross over the border into Rwanda where several Congolese forces have surrendered.\n\n\u201cWe are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,\u201d said Safi Shangwe, who was among those on the move.\n\nFighting with M23 rebels in eastern Congo has left at least 13 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers dead, United Nations and army officials said Saturday. The UN peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.\n\nThe Uruguayan army, in Goma serving with the UN peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on the social platform X late Sunday that more than 100 Congolese soldiers were laying down their weapons.\n\nWho are the rebels and why is Goma of interest to them?\n\nThe M23 refers to the March 23, 2009, agreement that ended a previous uprising in the region. The group was created in 2012 after the failed integration of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army. It claims it took up arms against Congolese forces to defend the Tutsis from discrimination but has often talked about targeting the Congolese government.\n\nAfter a decade of inactivity, the group resurfaced in late 2021, with its leaders accusing the Congolese government of neglecting its commitments to demobilize and integrate Congolese Tutsis into the country\u2019s army and administration. Its number has since grown from hundreds to around 6,500 fighters, according to the UN.\n\nUnlike in 2012 when the rebels only wanted to be integrated into the Congolese army and to have greater participation in the political process, their motive this time is rooted in a desire to control parts of eastern Congo, said Darren Davids, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cDRC will have to rely on the international community to once again pressure Rwanda and M23 into releasing the city, but it\u2019s unclear if the will this time around,\u201d Davids added.",

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the matter publicly.\n\nAdditionally, three Malawian peacekeepers were killed in eastern Congo, the United Nations in Malawi said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe UN Security Council moved up an emergency meeting on the escalating violence to Sunday morning (10 a.m. ET). Congo requested the meeting, which had originally been scheduled for Monday.\n\nM23 has made significant territorial gains in recent weeks, encircling the eastern city of Goma, which has around 2 million people and is a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts.\n\nThe United Nations said it would temporarily relocate nonessential staff from Goma, such as administrative staff.\n\n\u201cEssential personnel remain on the ground, sustaining critical operations such as food distribution, medical assistance, shelter, and protection for vulnerable communities,\u201d the U.N. statement read.\n\nM23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, along the border with Rwanda, in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.\n\nOn Thursday, M23 took control of the town of Sake, which is only 27 kilometers (16 miles) west of Goma and one of the last main routes into the provincial capital still under government control, according to UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s department of defense confirmed the deaths of the two South African peacekeepers in a statement Saturday. It said seven South African soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC, were also killed during clashes with M23 over the last two days.\n\n\u201cAfter two days of fierce fighting with the M23 rebel group in the eastern DRC, the South African contingent, alongside its counterparts, was able to halt the advancement of the rebel group towards Goma,\u201d South Africa\u2019s department of defense added.\n\nSince 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces, including SAMIDRC and U.N. troops, have been keeping M23 away from Goma.\n\nThe UN peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance, said Saturday an additional 18 South African soldiers were injured in the clashes with M23. The rebel offensive \u201ccoincided with the inauguration of US President Donald Trump,\u201d the party\u2019s statement read.\n\nThe United States has previously played a key role in attempting to protect civilians in eastern Congo, making several high-level statements and visits, said Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Africa at Amnesty International USA.\n\n\u201cThe Rwandan-backed M23 is clearly exploiting the presidential transition in the US to advance on Goma \u2014 putting thousands more civilians at risk,\u201d Hixon told The Associated Press.\n\nUruguay\u2019s military in a statement issued Saturday identified its member killed in Congo as Rodolfo \u00c1lvarez, who was part of the Uruguay IV Battalion. The unit, according to the statement, is working \u201cuninterruptedly to comply with the United Nations mandate, as well as to guarantee the evacuation of non-essential civilian and military personnel from the city of Goma.\u201d\n\n\u201cVarious measures have been taken to improve the security of our troops, who are operating in adverse conditions,\u201d the military said. It added that four Uruguayan peacekeepers were also injured. Three of them remained in Goma while a fourth one was evacuated to Uganda for treatment.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s defense minister, Angie Motshekga, was visiting the country\u2019s troops stationed in Congo as part of the UN peacekeeping mission the day the soldiers were killed.\n\nCongo, the United States and UN experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago.\n\nRwanda\u2019s government denies the claim, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. UN experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\n\ufeffThe Israeli military has intensified operations across the occupied West Bank, targeting Palestinian militant cells, imposing roadblocks and cutting communities off from the outside world.\n\nThe sudden expansion of Israeli security operations in the West Bank has killed at least 10 people and follows the start of the delicate ceasefire process in Gaza, by which Israeli hostages are released in stages and will also see the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe move also comes as the Israeli right, and many in the settler movement, feel emboldened by the words of some officials in the Trump administration who have suggested Israel has the right to annex much or all of the West Bank, home to more than three million Palestinians.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the West Bank\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has spoken of a new dynamic in the West Bank, saying the military will adopt tactics learned in the Gaza offensive in its efforts to eradicate militant groups and, in his words, \u201censure that terrorism does not return.\u201d\n\nThe Jenin refugee camp in the north of the West Bank, a sprawling area of narrow alleys that has long been a bastion of militant factions, is front and center of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) latest campaign.\n\nKatz said Tuesday that Operation \u201cIron Wall\u201d would \u201celiminate terrorists and terror infrastructure in the camp, ensuring that terrorism does not return to the camp after the operation is over \u2013 the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the operation in Jenin is more ambitious than previous incursions. Hundreds of civilians have left the camp; Jenin governor Kamal Abu Al-Roub told CNN Thursday that it was now nearly empty. Water had been cut off and the area was \u201cunder siege,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest IDF operations have involved building more roadblocks across the West Bank. The Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission said Thursday there are now nearly 900 military checkpoints, including more than 173 iron gates installed since October 2023.\n\nAl-Roub said the IDF operation was \u201cone of the biggest and most intense\u201d yet launched: \u201cWe are talking over 20,000 people have been displaced. Many have been arrested.\u201d\n\nPalestinian television reported Thursday that the IDF had established roadblocks near Ramallah and sealed off one village in the area. Additionally, it said military checkpoints in the Nablus area had been reinforced, leaving thousands of people stranded amid lengthy waits.\n\nPeople were also unable to leave Jericho, where military checkpoints had been closed. Palestinian journalists reported Thursday that tear gas had been used against people waiting at a Jericho checkpoint.\n\nOne woman had died of a heart attack at a checkpoint near Hebron after the IDF prevented her from being transferred to hospital, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported Wednesday.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told CNN a trip from Ramallah to Jericho, which usually takes 45 minutes, can now take five hours some days.\n\nCommuters wait in their vehicles at the Israeli Atara checkpoint on route 465 near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday. Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMost of the movement from the south and north of the West Bank is paralyzed while illegal Israeli settlers move freely and continue to attack Palestinian cars on the roads,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing disturbing patterns of unlawful use of force in the West Bank that is unnecessary, indiscriminate and disproportionate. This echoes the tactics Israeli forces have employed in Gaza,\u201d said Angelita Caredda, Middle East and North Africa regional director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\n\nThe IDF said Thursday that the checkpoints were \u201ca tool we use in the fight against terror, enabling civilian movement while providing a layer of screening to prevent terrorists from escaping.\u201d\n\nHow does the ceasefire affect the situation in the West Bank?\n\nThe operation began two days after the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire began and demonstrates a shift in the Israeli government\u2019s focus.\n\nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Tuesday: \u201cWe have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria [the Biblical term many Israelis use to describe the West Bank] and in the campaign to eradicate terrorism in the region.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed the cabinet had decided that security in the West Bank had become an official war goal for Israel. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office did not confirm the move.\n\nThe truce in Gaza has allowed Israeli security forces to concentrate on the West Bank, where groups aligned with Hamas have become more active. There is a risk, however, that intensive Israeli military action across the West Bank will put the Gaza ceasefire under strain.\n\nKatz has frequently alleged that Iran is behind the surge in militant activity in the West Bank and is supplying weapons to the groups.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow Judea and Samaria to become like Gaza or southern Lebanon\u2026 We will act to cut off Iran\u2019s tentacles in the refugee camps in the West Bank and ensure the security of the communities and residents.\u201d\n\nIsraeli officials have said that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been unable to confront and subdue militant groups. An operation in December by the Palestinian security forces against militants in Jenin yielded little progress. The militant factions include the Al Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Qassem Brigades, who together fight under the banner of the Jenin Battalion.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Channel 11 quoted a senior military source Thursday as saying, \u201cThe PA did what they could. We recognized the need to act against the terrorists\u2019 capabilities, we are no longer waiting for their intentions. Our goal is to neutralize the Jenin battalion.\u201d\n\nHow the Trump administration affects dynamics\n\nTo some right-wing Israelis, the advent of the Trump administration \u2013 along with success in degrading Hamas and Hezbollah \u2013 provides a unique opportunity to extend Israeli superiority in the region.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held US stance that settlements are illegal; Biden restored it. Several of Trump\u2019s nominees have suggested Israel has the right to annex the West Bank.\n\nMore than 500,000 Jewish settlers live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.\n\nElise Stefanik, who is slated to become the new US ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday she agreed with the view that Israel has \u201ca biblical right\u201d to annex the West Bank. Mike Huckabee, who is expected to become US ambassador to Israe\ufeffl, has said in the past that there is \u201cno such thing as a Palestinian.\u201d\n\nElise Stefanik testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on her nomination to be Ambassador to the United Nations on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, the day he took office, Trump rescinded sanctions imposed by the former Biden administration on far-right Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of being involved in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAnti-Palestinian violence by extremist settlers has become a near-daily occurrence in the West Bank. In 2024, the UN documented 1,420 incidents of settler violence resulting in casualties and/or property damage in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\n\nSome of those responsible were arrested, but the Israeli Defense Ministry last week decided to release Jewish settlers held under what\u2019s known as administrative detention \u201cin light of the expected release of terrorists to the territories of Judea and Samaria,\u201d under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\nKatz said the decision to release the settlers would \u201csend a clear message of strengthening and encouraging settlement, which stands at the forefront of the struggle against Palestinian terror and growing security challenges.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct Mike Huckabee\u2019s previous comments about Palestinians.",

At least 16 Sudanese nationals were killed last week when riots erupted in South Sudan\u2019s capital Juba and elsewhere in the country.\n\nYouths in several cities looted and vandalized shops owned by Sudanese nationals and burned several homes, police said, in retaliation for what they believed was the involvement of Sudan\u2019s military and allied groups in the killings in El Gezira.\n\nThe Sudanese army has condemned what it called \u201cindividual violations\u201d in El Gezira.\n\n\u201cThe effect is a bit huge because as an artist, I depend so much on social media,\u201d said Isaac Anthony Lumori, also known as Mc Lumoex, a popular South Sudanese musician and founder of a comedy show.\n\n\u201cMy message to the government is to seek an amicable way of solving this issue, especially engaging the government of Sudan to make sure that (their) army does not misbehave to the extent of taking human life,\u201d he told Reuters.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nViolent weather exacerbated by climate change fueled hunger and food insecurity across Latin America and the Caribbean in 2023, according to a new United Nations report.\n\nExtreme weather drove up crop prices in multiple countries in the region in 2023, the report, which was written by several UN agencies including the World Food Program (WFP), says.\n\nHot weather and drought, intensified by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, raised the price of corn in Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, while heavy rain in Ecuador caused a 32 to 54 percent increase in wholesale prices in the same year.\n\nThough the report credits social safety nets with a measurable decrease in undernourishment throughout Latin America, it notes that the region\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable populations are still more likely to suffer from food insecurity due to climate change \u2013 especially rural people.\n\n\u201cThe shocks are getting much more extreme,\u201d said Lola Castro, the WFP\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cThis is what\u2019s creating larger food insecurity and under-nutrition.\u201d\n\nQuoting a 2020 study, the report states that 36% of 439 small farms surveyed in rural Honduras and Guatemala experienced \u201cepisodic food insecurity due to extreme weather events.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn more rural areas they\u2026don\u2019t have a lot of resources to be able to weather a poor harvest,\u201d said Ivy Blackmore, a researcher affiliated with the University of Missouri who studied nutrition and agriculture among Indigenous farming communities in Ecuador.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t generate as much income. There\u2019s not as much nutritious food around, so they sell what they can, and then they purchase the cheapest thing that\u2019ll fill them up,\u201d she added.\n\nIn the communities she studied, erosion from prolonged rain led farmers to plant on virgin grassland nearby.\n\n\u201cThey might have a couple of good harvests. Then the erosion continues, and they dig up more,\u201d Blackmore said. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme erosion going on because they\u2019re just having to sustain themselves in the short term without being able to address these long-term consequences.\u201d\n\nA push for drought resistant crops\n\nAs extreme weather increases food prices, some consumers gravitate toward cheaper, but less nutritious, ultra-processed foods. This is a particularly dangerous trend in Latin America, the UN report says, where \u201cthe cost of healthy diets is the highest in the world\u201d and both childhood and adult obesity have risen markedly since 2000.\n\nOne solution may lie in the region\u2019s traditional foods, such as quinoa, and tuberous root vegetables like mashua and melloco, among others. In addition to being healthier, traditional produce may also be able to resist the worst shocks of climate change.\n\n\u201cMany Andean cereals are heavily drought resistant,\u201d Castro pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re working with smallholder farmers in very different areas with indigenous populations in Latin America and the Caribbean to bring back those foods to the table.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, those foods may already be on the table. Traditional terrace farming in the Andes \u201cis amazingly resilient,\u201d said Carlos Andres Gallego-Riofr\u00edo, a research assistant professor at the University of Vermont. \u201cIt retains the moisture, it retains the fertility of the soil.\u201d\n\nCaliata, one of the farming communities he studied in central Ecuador, experiences low rates of chronic disease despite being \u201conly 14 kilometers from the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could buy Coca-Cola,\u201d Gallego-Riofr\u00edo said. \u201cThey could buy whatever they want in the store, like any super processed food. Still, we barely see that in their diets.\u201d Most of the food eaten in Caliata is grown by the families there, with plenty of tubers, beans, barley, and fruit rather than packaged foods bought elsewhere. The most popular meat is guinea pig, used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.\n\n\u201cIn the Andean traditional systems, there\u2019s so much to learn,\u201d Gallego-Riofr\u00edo concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that can be transferred to other communities and we would see way better yields in terms of ecosystem and human health outcomes.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPope Francis is taking the highly unusual decision to dissolve an influential Catholic group from Peru which has been plagued by allegations of abuse from within its community, including allegations related to its founder, for more than a decade.\n\nNews of the decision to dissolve the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which at one point had 20,000 members across South America and parts of the United States, was confirmed in a statement by the group, although the Vatican has yet to comment or publish anything official about the move.\n\nThe decision to suppress the Sodalitium was first reported by Spanish-language site Infovaticana with the Sodalitum saying the \u201ccentral information\u201d in that report was true but that \u201cit contained several inaccuracies,\u201d although it did not specify what these were.\n\nFigari has denied all the allegations against him. Reached for comment by CNN, his lawyer Jorge Ernesto Villa Avila emphasized that Figari maintains his innocence, and pointed out that he has not been convicted in a court of law for the allegations.\n\nA papal decision to dissolve or suppress a Catholic religious community is rare and in the Sodalitium\u2019s case follows attempts by the church hierarchy to reform the group and a 2023 Vatican investigation which uncovered \u201csadistic\u201d abuses of power, authority and spirituality. Its founder, Luis Fernando Figari, had earlier been found to allegedly committed sexual acts with recruits along with accusations of serious financial mismanagement, according to a 2017 outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium.\n\nAfter the Vatican probe carried out by Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, Figari was expelled from the order by the pope in August 2024 and a month later the pope expelled 10 more of its leading members. One of those expelled was found to have carried out \u201cabuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism,\u201d an unusual charge.\n\nThe Sodalitium, in a January 21 communique, said they had so far paid in excess of $5 million in damages to victims of abuse. \u201cWith this report, the members of the Sodalitium, feeling deep sorrow and shame for the harm caused to specific individuals and their families, reiterate our request for forgiveness to all those who have suffered because of these actions,\u201d it wrote.\n\nA victim of Figari told CNN last year that he was abused at least three times in the 1970s at the age of 17 with him and other victims looking to the Vatican investigation and papal response to bring a measure of justice.\n\nBut the victims have waited years for church authorities to act, with victims lodging complaints with the Archdiocese of Lima in 2011 and reportedly even earlier. A turning point came with a 2015 book, \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d written by one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, and journalist Paola Ugaz.\n\nUgaz told CNN she believed the pope\u2019s decision is \u201cunprecedented\u201d as it is the first time that \u201ca Catholic organization that abused its members and committed economic misconduct\u201d has been suppressed. Her journalism, she said, had led to a \u201ctsunami of persecution that the Sodalitium directed against me for seven years\u201d and that she owed \u201cinvaluable gratitude\u201d to the pope.\n\nFounded in 1971 in Peru as a lay group (a \u201cSociety of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right\u201d), the Sodalitium exercised huge influence as it sought to recruit mostly young white boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links.\n\nIt was also politically driven as a fight back against the rise of liberation theology in Latin America, a radical movement which began in the 1960s and focussed on supporting the poor.\n\nSalinas told CNN last year that the group\u2019s thinking mixed \u201cthe Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d while the 2017 investigation described Figari as \u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist, and obsessed with sexual issues.\u201d That report also found that sexual, physical and psychological abuse took place in the order.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMore than 32,000 people have fled to towns in northeast Colombia as they attempt to escape a sharp rise in fighting between militant factions, according to the country\u2019s ombudsman.\n\nIris Mar\u00edn said the violence escalated last week in the Catatumbo region, displacing tens of thousands of people. Hundreds more remain confined to their homes and are unable to evacuate due to the ferocity of the clashes, Mar\u00edn warned Tuesday in a video statement.\n\nColombian authorities say 80 people have been killed in the fighting.\n\nAlmost half of those displaced have flocked to the city of C\u00facuta near the Venezuelan border. Officials there have launched a major campaign to shelter the more than 15,000 people who have arrived in recent days.\n\nIn C\u00facuta, the city\u2019s football stadium has been turned into a large welcome center, with thousands of displaced victims lining up to receive food, water and clothing from locals.\n\nMany are also sheltering in hotels and the homes of relatives, C\u00facuta Mayor Jorge Acevedo said, pledging to support those in need.\n\n\u201cWe are going to address the emergency that is occurring. Total solidarity, respect, affection and love for these human beings who are arriving in the city of C\u00facuta,\u201d Acevedo said.\n\nViolence in strategic drug production territory\n\nThe humanitarian crisis is a direct result of increased clashes between the National Liberation Army \u2013 ELN \u2013 and spin-off groups of the disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.\n\nBoth factions were founded around the 1960s and \u201870s as left-wing guerrilla groups, but are now mostly involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, Colombia senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nPeople displaced by violence in towns across the Catatumbo region line up to register for shelter at a stadium in C\u00facuta, Colombia, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025. Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nThe Catatumbo region in northeastern Colombia, where the crisis originated, is a strategic territory for both drug production and trafficking due to its proximity with Venezuela. The region has seen some of the highest levels of violence in modern Colombian history.\n\nIn response to the violence, Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro has suspended peace talks with the ELN, whose actions he described as criminal. On Monday, he said he would declare a state of internal unrest, but that decree has yet to be published or signed.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office on Wednesday reactivated arrest warrants for 31 ELN members who were involved in peace negotiations. The judicial body said the move was due to \u201cthe evidence and the seriousness of the criminal acts\u201d in the Catatumbo region.\n\nThe arrest warrants had been suspended since 2022, when Petro restarted the peace process with that armed group.\n\nSome have criticized Petro\u2019s \u201ctotal peace\u201d initiative which has attempted to reduce violence partly through negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe crisis in Catatumbo should be a wake-up call for the Petro administration. Its \u2018total peace\u2019, coupled with the lack of effective security and justice policies, have allowed armed groups to expand their presence and brutal control over remote communities across Colombia,\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Colombian foreign ministry for comment.\n\nEvacuation efforts\n\nThe Colombian cities of Oca\u00f1a and Tib\u00fa have also received 11,503 and 5,300 displaced people respectively, Colombia\u2019s ombudsman Mar\u00edn said Tuesday.\n\nOther victims have fled to neighboring Venezuela, a country that in recent years has seen far more people leaving its borders than entering due to spiraling economic and political insecurity.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil said the country has implemented a humanitarian operation to help Colombian families that have arrived in the municipality of Jesus Maria Sempr\u00fan near the border in recent days.\n\nColombia\u2019s defense ministry said more than 400 evacuations have been carried out in the Catatumbo region since the uptick in fighting last week, while more than 5,000 soldiers and special forces unit have been deployed to C\u00facuta.",

                "text": "Ciudad Juarez, Mexico CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Jose Guillermo Cabrera arrived last weekend in Ciudad Juarez, a city along the US-Mexico border, he was full of hope. \u201cI felt like every migrant, excited, after so much time waiting,\u201d Cabrera, 33, told CNN.\n\nCiudad Juarez was meant to be a city of passage for Cabrera and his family, a final stop before their long-awaited moment in front of US immigration authorities to request asylum.\n\nFor several months, Cabrera had been applying for a shot at having his asylum claim heard by US authorities, while navigating around southern Mexico. In early January, confirmation came that he had finally secured an appointment.\n\nBut a day before the appointment, a stroke of President Donald Trump\u2019s pen shut down the US immigration processing app known as CBP One \u2013 and with it, Cabrera\u2019s hopes.\n\n\u201cSo much time waiting, and now this surprise,\u201d Cabrera said with a voice of defeat. \u201cThey shut off our dreams.\u201d\n\nUntil Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, migrants seeking asylum from violence or persecution had the option to schedule an appointment at a legal US port of entry to make their case.\n\n\u201cWe are left adrift, we have no resources left, we arrived in Juarez with money to pay for one night in a hotel,\u201d the native Venezuelan said.\n\nCabrera is one of several migrants CNN spoke to who recently arrived in Ciudad Juarez after weeks of travel for their CBP One appointments, only to find the sessions they had been given were canceled.\n\nNow, many are stranded with no money or any sense of what to do next.\n\nIt was just below freezing in Ciudad Juarez on Monday when Cabrera realized what had happened, but he and his family decided to still try to explain the situation to US immigration authorities at the Paso del Norte bridge, which connects the Mexican city with the Texas city of El Paso.\n\n\u201cI had a thread of hope,\u201d Cabrera told CNN, fighting the cold in a leather jacket and with a winter mask covering most of his face.\n\nBut they were quickly turned away. Cabrera and his family were instead directed to a local Mexican public agency for further guidance. There, they were given some warm soup, but got little information on how to pursue their case.\n\n\u2018We did everything legally\u2019\n\nErlianny Colombie, 41, left Cuba seven months ago and had been living in the southern Mexico town of Tapachula along with three relatives.\n\nAfter finding a place to work and live in Tapachula, he applied for an appointment with US officials.\n\n\u201cWe got lucky, we got an appointment,\u201d Colombie told CNN. \u201cSo, we bought bus tickets, we obtained permission to move through Mexico, a lot of sacrifice, we did everything legally.\u201d\n\nBut the travel and costs of obtaining paperwork stretched his resources to breaking point. \u201cWe had enough money for the night before our appointment (\u2026) and now we are on the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nColombie \u2013 who says he fled Cuba due to political persecution \u2013 says he \u201cunderstands\u201d Trump\u2019s decision but asks the president to reconsider for those who already had an appointment.\n\nErlianny Colombie from Cuba, holds his CBP One appointment confirmation for Tuesday, January 21. Abel Alvarado/CNN\n\nVenezuelan migrant Jose Guillermo Cabera shows his CBP One appointment confirmation for Tuesday, January 21 Abel Alvarado/CNN\n\n\u201cIf we already were in the process, Mr. Trump, please continue with the scheduled appointments, don\u2019t leave us here stranded,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sentiment is echoed by other migrants, who say they carefully followed the rules given to them by the United States, and deserve to be heard out.\n\n\u201cGive us another opportunity,\u201d Venezuelan migrant Rosalyn Vargas, 33, asked of Trump.\n\n\u201cWe came here for a brighter future, we are human beings, we did everything legally, we followed the process,\u201d Vargas said from a shelter where she\u2019s staying with other relatives.\n\n\u201cWe all have a story to tell. I fled Venezuela because I was being persecuted, please give us our appointments back,\u201d her compatriot Oswal Paredes told CNN.\n\nWho is helping the migrants at the border?\n\nMigrant shelters in Ciudad Juarez are taking in some of the migrants who have now been stranded.\n\nCasa del Migrante, a shelter about 10 miles from the border, says they are offering shelter, food and psychological help to migrants whose appointments were canceled.\n\n\u201cRight now, they are emotionally destroyed, after battling so much, all the walking, a lot of them crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap,\u201d Ivonne Lopez, a social worker, from Casa del Migrante told CNN, referring to a treacherous jungle passage that many migrants must make on foot to cross from South America to North America.\n\n\u201cThey want a sign of hope, they want to know what\u2019s going to happen with them, they had their appointment canceled, but is there another option,\u201d Lopez said, adding that \u201cthankfully, they have lawyers helping the migrants.\u201d\n\nSome local officials have taken a blunter approach with migrants, underlining that it\u2019s unrealistic to keep trying to reach the US.\n\n\u201cWe have to tell it like it is, sadly, all appointments are suspended as well as any possibility of getting one,\u201d Enrique Serrano, a coordinator from Chihuahua state\u2019s population agency told CNN.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t obtain anything by trying at the crossing points hoping for the US to receive them,\u201d he said.\n\nSerrano says Mexican city, state and federal officials are working together to address the migrant crisis in Ciudad Juarez and other border towns.\n\n\u201cMigrants here should stay calm, there are no instructions for raids here on the Mexican side, the instructions we\u2019ve been given is to give them proper treatment,\u201d Serrano said.\n\n\u201cShelters in Juarez are at 40% capacity,\u201d Serrano also said, noting that many Mexican border towns are expanding protective spaces in anticipation of mass deportations from the US.\n\nFor now, all of the migrants CNN interviewed said they would not give up \u2013 preferring to remain in limbo near the border and continue to hope their voices reach Trump, after having come so close.\n\n\u201cEverything changed from one moment to another, we went from hope to desperation,\u201d 23-year-old Fabian Delgado said from a shelter.",

Both engines were buried in the embankment\u2019s soil mound, and the fore fuselage scattered up to 30-200 meters from the embankment,\u201d it said.\n\nThe report does not say what may have led to the two data recorders to stop recording simultaneously just before the pilots declared mayday. The aircraft was at an altitude of 498 ft (152 metres) flying at 161 knots (298 km/h or 185 mph) at the moment the blackboxes stopped recording, it said.",

                "text": "Taipei, Taiwan CNN \u2014\n\nHours after Donald Trump\u2019s chilly inauguration in Washington, Taiwan\u2019s parliament voted to freeze billions of dollars in defense spending, in a move some worry could frustrate the famously transactional president, who has already demanded Taipei pay \u201cmore\u201d for US protection.\n\nThe US is the main ally and arms supplier of Taiwan, a democratically ruled island and semiconductor powerhouse, which China\u2019s Communist Party views as part of its territory \u2013despite never having controlled it \u2013 and has vowed to take one day, by force if necessary.\n\nThe opposition-led vote to freeze defense spending highlights the domestic challenges facing Taiwan President Lai Ching-te even as China ramps up its diplomatic and military efforts to isolate and intimidate the island.\n\nLai\u2019s party lacks a majority in Taiwan\u2019s rough and tumble parliament, throwing doubt on his ability to pass legislation that will shore up US support \u2013 and the approval of a mercurial commander in chief in the White House.\n\n\u201cIf there is not enough budget to consistently improve Taiwan\u2019s defense reforms and capabilities, the international community will doubt Taiwan\u2019s determination to defend ourselves,\u201d Lai said Tuesday in a Facebook post.\n\nLai\u2019s administration also slammed the opposition-backed budget freeze, which covers locally designed submarines and an indigenous drone program.\n\nThe move was \u201csuicidal,\u201d Taiwan Premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters on Thursday, while Defense Minister Wellington Koo said it sent \u201cthe wrong signal to the United States.\u201d\n\nNavigating Trump 2.0\n\nTrump\u2019s return to power \u2013 and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda \u2013 has created some anxiety in Taiwan about Washington\u2019s commitment to the island in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nFor decades, the US has maintained a close security partnership with Taipei, despite lacking formal diplomatic relations. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. However, Washington has remained deliberately vague on how it would respond to an invasion \u2013 a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d\n\nLast year, US intelligence assessments suggested that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had ordered his military to be ready for an invasion by 2027, though assessments stressed that doesn\u2019t mean an invasion will occur in 2027.\n\nDays before Trump took office, Taiwan\u2019s defense ministry made a rare acknowledgement that Washington had signed a two-year agreement to train Taiwanese soldiers at a naval base on the island. While Taiwan has previously confirmed the presence of US military trainers, it was unusual for the military to release details of such exchanges.\n\nBut Trump has been a less vocal supporter of Taiwan than his predecessor Joe Biden. Last year, he wrongly accused Taiwan of stealing \u201calmost 100%\u201d of America\u2019s semiconductor industry. He also indicated that Taiwan should pay more for US protection, while suggesting the US would have difficulty defending the island because of its distance.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly called for Taiwan to increase its defense spending to 10% of its GDP \u2013 a fourfold rise from its current allocation. Analysts told CNN the demand would be unrealistic, noting that Taiwan already has a backlog of more than $20 billion in undelivered US military equipment.\n\nOn the streets of the capital Taipei, some residents told CNN they were worried about how the political bickering would be seen by the new US administration.\n\n\u201cI hope that Taiwan\u2019s legislature doesn\u2019t embarrass itself and lose face to foreign countries,\u201d said Wang Cheng-yi, a postgraduate student at National Taiwan University. \u201cThis might make people feel that while Taiwan is good at certain things, politically it is quite unstable.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Hsu, a 75-year-old Taipei resident who only gave her surname, the key to fostering political unity is simple.\n\n\u201cEverybody should sit down and talk,\u201d she said. \u201cTaiwan must balance relations with both the US and China. We are small. We cannot afford to make either big brother unhappy. It\u2019s a delicate situation.\u201d\n\nMilitary readiness\n\nWhile Taipei is heavily armed with US weaponry, it is significantly outmatched by Beijing, which has the world\u2019s largest standing army and spends about 11 times more on defense than Taiwan.\n\nThere are also concerns among defense experts about the effectiveness of Taiwan\u2019s reservist training and the military\u2019s slow progress in transitioning to asymmetric warfare \u2013 a strategy that focuses on smaller, harder-to-detect weapons like drones and portable missiles. While Taipei has accelerated military reforms in recent years, some observers \u2013 including the Council on Foreign Affairs \u2013 say it needs to do far more.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Taiwan\u2019s military facing budget challenges.\n\nEarlier this week, undersea cables connecting Taiwan to the outlying Matsu islands were severed due to \u201cnatural deterioration,\u201d according to the island\u2019s digital affairs ministry. The islands \u2013 controlled by Taipei but located just a few miles off the Chinese coast \u2013 previously experienced internet outages after the same cables were damaged in 2023.\n\nThe ministry warned that new budget cuts \u2013 which covered everything from health care to foreign affairs \u2013 would undermine its ability to repair critical infrastructure, highlighting concerns about vulnerabilities that could be exploited by Beijing.\n\nAlexander Huang, head of international affairs for the main opposition Kuomintang party, defended the freeze on defense spending and questioned the effectiveness of investing heavily in a submarine program before the first vessel had even completed sea trials.\n\n\u201cWe are not opposing indigenous weapon system development. However, we emphasize that we need to be very prudent to make sure our self-designed submarine can actually work,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nBut Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant research fellow at Taiwan\u2019s Academia Sinica, said it was \u201cextra bad\u201d that Taiwan\u2019s domestic political bickering had hindered the island from presenting a united message to the Trump team that it was serious about its defense and worthy of continued American support.\n\n\u201cWith or without Trump\u2019s inauguration, with China\u2019s increasing aggression over Taiwan, it is indeed Taiwan\u2019s top priority to continue to increase its self-defense budget,\u201d Yen said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not a good signal.\u201d\n\nYeh Hsin-wei, a student in Taipei, said Taiwan\u2019s vast semiconductor industry that supplies many of the chips powering the global AI revolution was a better deterrent against Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe world needs our chips, so I think China wouldn\u2019t risk a war,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe need to be prepared, but maybe not worry too much.\u201d",

                "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nA Chinese man who carried out a knife attack in eastern China last June that wounded a Japanese woman and her child and killed a bus attendant trying to protect them has been sentenced to death, according to a Japanese official.\n\nA court in the Chinese city of Suzhou ruled that the 52-year-old unemployed man, surnamed Zhou, stabbed the trio after he became indebted and lost interest in living, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Thursday.\n\nDetails of the ruling were not immediately available through Chinese official announcements or local news reports, but Hayashi said Japan\u2019s Consul General to Shanghai attended the sentencing.\n\n\u201cThe (Japanese) government considers the killing and wounding of three people, including a completely innocent child, to be unforgivable, and we take the verdict with the utmost seriousness,\u201d Hayashi said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stopped short of confirming the sentencing, saying only that \u201cChinese judicial authorities will handle (the case) in accordance with the law\u201d at a daily press conference on Thursday.\n\nA bus stop where the mother and her son were stabbed in Suzhou. Ichiro Ohara/The Yomiuri Shimbun/AP/File\n\nThe stabbing attack was the first of two on Japanese nationals last year that raised concerns about anti-Japanese sentiment in China and prompted Tokyo to demand Beijing ensure its citizens\u2019 safety.\n\nKnife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled.\n\nThe attacks relating to Japanese citizens have also occurred amid a surge of sudden episodes of violence targeting random members of the public in China, including at or near hospitals and schools.\n\nThe attack took place on June 24 when the Japanese mother was picking up her child at a bus stop near a Japanese school, Japanese officials previously said.\n\nThe mother and child suffered non-life-threatening injuries during the attack. But a Chinese bus attendant who tried to stop the attacker later died of her wounds.\n\nOn Thursday, Hayashi repeated calls for the Chinese government to protect Japanese nationals in China. The Suzhou court ruling stopped short of making any reference to Japan, he noted.\n\nNationalism, xenophobia and anti-Japanese sentiment have been on the rise in the country, often fanned by state media and manifested in discussions on China\u2019s strictly censored social media platforms.\n\nThe sentiment is rooted in bitter memories of Japan\u2019s invasion and brutal occupation in the 1930s and 1940s and fueled by present-day territorial disputes.\n\nIn September last year, a 10-year-old Japanese schoolboy was killed in a second knife attack near another Japanese school in the southern city of Shenzhen. The trial in that case was due to begin on Friday, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nThe second attack took place on the anniversary of the \u201c918\u201d incident in 1931, when Japanese soldiers blew up a Japanese-owned railway in northeast China and blamed Chinese forces for the attack as a pretext to invade.\n\nThe two attacks raised alarm among Japanese living in China and prompted then Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida to demand \u201csuch an incident must never be repeated.\u201d\n\nBut China\u2019s foreign ministry described the attacks as \u201cisolated incidents,\u201d and said it had taken steps to ensure foreign nationals\u2019 safety in the country.\n\n\u201cChina will continue to take measures to protect the safety of foreign citizens in China,\u201d Mao said on Thursday.",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nFighting around Sudan\u2018s largest oil refinery set the sprawling complex ablaze, satellite data analyzed by The Associated Press on Saturday shows, sending thick, black smoke over the country\u2019s capital.\n\nForces loyal to Sudan\u2019s military under army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan later claimed they captured the refinery, owned by Sudan\u2019s government and the state-run China National Petroleum Corp. The facility represents a long-sought prize for the military in its civil war with the rebel Rapid Support Force.\n\nInternational mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, have not halted the fighting.\n\nThe al-Jaili refinery sits some 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of Khartoum, the capital. The refinery has been subject to previous attacks as the RSF has claimed control of the facility since April 2023 and their forces had been guarding it. Local Sudanese media report the RSF also surrounded the refinery with fields of landmines to slow any advance.\n\nBut the facility, capable of handling 100,000 barrels of oil a day, remained broadly intact until Thursday. On that day, an attack at the refinery set fires across the complex, according to satellite data from NASA satellites that track wildfires worldwide.\n\nSatellite images taken by Planet Labs PBC on Friday for the AP showed vast areas of the refinery ablaze. The images, shot just after 1200 GMT, showed flames shooting up into the sky in several spots. Oil tanks at the facility stood burned, covered in soot.\n\nThick plumes of black smoke towered over the site, carried south toward Khartoum by the wind. Exposure to that smoke can exacerbate respiratory problems and raise cancer risks.\n\nSmoke billows from al-Jaili oil refinery on January 15. AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, the Sudanese military alleged the RSF was responsible for the fire at the refinery.\n\nThe RSF \u201cdeliberately set fire to the Khartoum refinery in al-Jaili this morning in a desperate attempt to destroy the infrastructures of this country,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThis hateful behavior reveals the extent of the criminality and decadence of this militia \u2026 (and) increases our determination to pursue it everywhere until we liberate every inch from their filth.\u201d\n\nThe RSF for its part alleged Thursday night that Sudanese military aircraft dropped \u201cbarrel bombs\u201d on the facility, \u201ccompletely destroying it.\u201d The RSF has claimed the Sudanese military uses old commercial cargo aircraft to drop barrel bombs, such as one that crashed under mysterious circumstances in October.\n\nNeither the Sudanese military nor the RSF offered evidence to support their dueling allegations. But on Saturday, multiple videos emerged of Burhan\u2019s forces claiming to have entered the refinery\u2019s compound, the sound of heavy gunfire heard in the background.\n\nSudan\u2019s military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdallah, also told the AP they had taken control of the refinery. The RSF did not immediately address the claim, nor another by Sudan\u2019s military they had broken a monthslong siege on the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum.\n\nChina, Sudan\u2019s largest trading partner before the war, has not acknowledged the blaze at the refinery. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina moved into Sudan\u2019s oil industry after Chevron Corp. left in 1992 amid violence targeting oil workers in another civil war. South Sudan broke away to become its own country in 2011, taking 75% of what had been Sudan\u2019s oil reserves with it.\n\nA wrecked car in Khartoum, Sudan, where clashes between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese army have taken place, on December 27, 2024. Osman Bakir/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres \u201cis following with great concern the recent escalation of fighting in Sudan\u201d a statement from his office Friday said, specifically mentioning the oil refinery attack.\n\n\u201cThe secretary-general urges the parties to refrain from all actions that could have dangerous consequences for Sudan and the region, including serious economic and environmental implications,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLosing the refinery would have a major effect on the economies of both Sudan and South Sudan.\n\n\u201cThe destruction of the refinery would force the Sudanese people to rely on more expensive fuel imports,\u201d warned Timothy Liptrot in an analysis for the Small Arms Survey in May 2024. \u201cAs the conflict progresses, a norm that exists among the RSF and (the Sudanese military) against damaging Sudan\u2019s accumulated capital is breaking down, with permanent damage to Sudan\u2019s refining infrastructure becoming increasingly possible.\u201d\n\nSudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.\n\nAl-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.\n\nThe Biden administration also sanctioned Burhan in its last days over his forces\u2019 \u201clethal attacks on civilians, including airstrikes against protected infrastructure including schools, markets and hospitals.\u201d It also said Burhan\u2019s troops were \u201cresponsible for the routine and intentional denial of humanitarian access, using food deprivation as a war tactic.\u201d\n\nThe RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.\n\nOther estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",

Local governments have asked the public to help identify iguana nests and they recommend fishing spears as the most humane means of killing the animals.\n\n\u201cA lot of people bought them as cute little pets, not realizing how big and long-lived they would become, so they set them free in the wild, where they\u2019ve really taken to the Taiwanese environment,\u201d said Lee Chi-ya of the agricultural department in the southern county of Pingtung. \u201cThat\u2019s allowed them to reproduce at a considerable rate, necessitating us to cull them and restore the balance of nature.\u201d\n\nGreen iguanas have no natural predators in Taiwan and have moved into areas that can be difficult to access, mostly forests and the edges of towns.\n\nMales can grow to 2 feet (6.6 feet) long, weigh 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and live up to 20 years, while females can lay up to 80 eggs at a time.\n\nMainly native to Central America and the Caribbean, they are not aggressive despite possessing sharp tails and jaws and razor-like teeth. The reptiles subsist on a diet of mostly fruit, leaves and plants, with the occasional small animal thrown in.\n\nThough popular as pets, they are difficult to keep healthy in captivity and many die within a year.\n\nHsu Wei-chieh, secretary general of the Reptile Conservation Association of Taiwan, said his group wants to teach farmers how to stay safe, protect their property and treat the iguanas in a humane manner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to help see that this project is carried out smoothly,\u201d said Hsu.\n\nTsai Po-wen, a vegetable farmer in Pingtung, said the training was paying off.\n\n\u201cWe used to attack them, but it wasn\u2019t any use. Now we\u2019re learning more effective, safer methods,\u201d Tsai said.",

                "text": "New York City CNN \u2014\n\nBefore she died of typhus at 15 inside the German concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, Anne Frank lived just over two years inside a secret 45-square meter (484-square foot) annex atop an Amsterdam home with her parents, sister and four others, all hiding from the Nazis.\n\nThat space \u2014 one of the most famous dwellings in history, thanks to Frank\u2019s best-selling published diary and subsequent plays and films \u2014 can now be explored remotely in New York. Having toured both, I was no less moved by the recreation. Anne Frank The Exhibition brings you into their world and puts it in larger context.\n\nFrom January 27 (International Holocaust Remembrance Day) through April 30, visitors to New York\u2019s Center for Jewish History near Union Square can take a self-guided tour of a detailed, full-scale recreation of the Amsterdam dwelling and get very close to its residents\u2019 personal belongings and related exhibits.\n\nIt\u2019s a moving journey that brings the massive, horrific scale of the Holocaust \u2014 in which approximately six million European Jews were murdered \u2014 down to the vibrant if cloistered life and shared experiences of just a handful of them.\n\nFrank\u2019s book, translated into more than 70 languages with over 30 million copies sold so far, reads like a nonfiction play at times. We get whole passages of absorbing dialogue, soliloquized observations, some stage direction and plenty of tense, claustrophobic scenes. And like some plays, the set is itself a character. Reading Frank\u2019s famous diary conjures in the mind, as many readers know, a visual map of the annex\u2019s layout.\n\nComparing one\u2019s imagined annex is part of the appeal of visiting Frank\u2019s actual secret annex home in Amsterdam, which has been open to visitors since 1960. When you visit, you may be struck by the size \u2014 bigger or smaller than you thought \u2014 or of the life-or-death significance of their hidden entrance behind a moving bookcase, or in the small universally human ephemera on display. So much life was lived there, even in seclusion.\n\nNow you can have that experience in Manhattan, for the first time outside Amsterdam. It\u2019s a unique opportunity to make Frank\u2019s story accessible to US schoolchildren.\n\nThe meticulous recreation is bookended, so to speak, by exhibits.\n\nOne displays photos and the original objects belonging to the family (handwritten notes, luggage, a desk, a transit pass, etc), from the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Another exhibit recounts the final chapters for the Annex\u2019s residents and others.\n\nIt\u2019s highly immersive in video, audio, photos and maps. In one room you walk on a glass floor with a bas-relief map of Europe under your shoes, red-orange flags marking the major Nazi concentration camps.\n\nThe rooms themselves are a vivid snapshot of both time and place.\n\nThere\u2019s a Monopoly-type stock exchange board game called Het Beursspel in the middle of the table in the kitchen/dining area. A sock with yarn needles is suspended in mid-darn. As the audio loop explains, Anne shared a room with an older man who wasn\u2019t a family member, and she put on their walls photos of early 1940s celebrities (Hollywood and royalty) to cheer the place up a bit. And then you look down at Anne\u2019s desk and there it is, a child\u2019s journal \u2013 plaid, fuzzy and with a lock. It\u2019s a facsimile, but that book, this room, is what Anne saw, and it\u2019s not a photo, not virtual.\n\nI didn\u2019t read \u201cAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\u201d as a school-age kid. I hadn\u2019t even read it when I toured the actual house in Amsterdam in my late 20s.\n\nThe story is famous enough without needing to. Instead, I read the surprisingly mature and bittersweet volume a few years ago, during the Covid lockdown. Not that the fear of that deadly virus was the same threat level as the Nazis. But there were still parallels in terms of isolation, not going to school or work, and the risk of human contact beyond the bubble of one\u2019s family.\n\nBut what really struck me was Frank\u2019s clear, ambitious and unintentionally prescient hopes for herself as a famous writer. As I toured her temporary home this time in New York, I recalled one of the few quotes I wrote down for myself when I read the book.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have lived in vain like most people,\u201d Frank wrote. \u201cI want to be useful or bring enjoyment to all people, even those I\u2019ve never met. I want to go on living even after my death!\u201d\n\nAs heartbreakingly early as that death was, she got her beautiful wish.\n\nYou can buy tickets at AnneFrankExhibit.org.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAnyone not familiar with the \u201cprosperity toss,\u201d a beloved Lunar New Year culinary tradition, could be forgiven for thinking they\u2019ve just walked in on the world\u2019s strangest food fight.\n\nIt is, admittedly, an unusual scene. As a tablecloth is laid, diners stand around the table, hovering close, chopsticks gripped tightly in their hands.\n\nAs each ingredient is added to a plate, auspicious words are chanted \u2014 first come the vegetables, then the slices of raw fish, followed by the dressing and, finally, garnishes such as nuts or wonton crisps.\n\nEveryone then digs into the salad at once, tossing the ingredients higher and higher while shouting louder and louder \u2014 all in the hopes of bringing good fortune for the coming year.\n\n\u201cSome of the most popular auspicious phrases include Huat ah! (meaning prosperity), Xin nian kuai le! (Happy New Year), and Da ji da li! (great luck and great fortune),\u201d says Paul Liew, third-generation owner of Keng Eng Kee Seafood (KEK), a Michelin Guide-recommended no-frills food stall in Singapore that serves a wide range of delicious home-style Chinese dishes.\n\n\u201cThe higher the toss, the more blessings you\u2019re wishing for. But it\u2019s more about the spirit of the celebration than a competition.\u201d\n\nMalaysia or Singapore: Who invented it?\n\nThe prosperity toss, also known as yusheng/yee sang (translated as raw fish) or lou sang/lo hei (stir up), is incredibly popular in Singapore and Malaysia. Both claim to have invented the modern version of this tradition. The truth remains murky.\n\n\u201cThe prosperity toss, or yusheng, is a dish that\u2019s closely associated with Lunar New Year celebrations here in Singapore,\u201d says Liew.\n\n\u201cThe Singapore version of yusheng, which I had read and been told, originated in the 1960s in Singapore, by the four chefs of Chinese cuisine during that era, known as the \u2018Four Heavenly Kings.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThese four prominent Chinese chefs \u2014 Sin Leong, Hooi Kok Wai, Tham Yui Kai and Lau Yoke Pui \u2014 are credited with establishing Cantonese cuisine in Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s. It\u2019s said that they decided to add seven kinds of colorful chopped vegetables as well as a sweet and sour plum and tangerine sauce to raw slices of fish \u2014 a traditional delicacy brought over from China with the diaspora \u2014 to create the prosperity toss that\u2019s known and loved today.\n\nLunar New Year feasts often include dishes associated with luck. These festive dishes can be found at Singapore's Keng Eng Kee Seafood restaurant, a Michelin Guide-recommended food stall. Courtesy Keng Eng Kee Seafood\n\nIn Malaysia, meanwhile, many people claim the dish was invented by chefs, inspired by traditional fish noodles, at a restaurant called Loke Ching Kee in Seremban City in the 1940s.\n\n\u201cFrom what I believe, the dish comes from the Cantonese people in Malaysia,\u201d says Aaron Khor, head chef and co-founder of Fifty Tales, a Malaysian Chinese restaurant that serves homemade noodles during the day and modern/casual Malaysian-Chinese cuisine at night.\n\n\u201cUsually served in big banquet restaurants, lou sang is enjoyed with a large group of people, usually 10 or more.\u201d\n\nThat these two Singaporean and Malaysian chefs don\u2019t agree on the origin of the prosperity toss will come as little surprise to those familiar with both nations\u2019 passion for food. The pair met at an event in Bangkok in 2024 and immediately clicked, as both of their restaurants specialize in Chinese comfort cuisine. Yet, when it comes to the origins of the prosperity toss, neither will back down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun topic that often sparks friendly debates among foodies from both countries,\u201d says Liew. \u201cWhile there are different claims, I personally believe that the modern version of the prosperity toss as we know it today was popularized here in Singapore.\u201d\n\nBrothers Paul Liew, left, and Wayne Liew are the third-generation owners of Keng Eng Kee Seafood. Courtesy Keng Eng Kee Seafood\n\nKhor adds that such debates aren\u2019t unusual, and it\u2019s all good-natured.\n\n\u201cIt is the same question as things like rendang, laksa and many other dishes that both Singapore and Malaysia share,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhile it does matter to know where it originated, it\u2019s also (important) to remember that both countries were once a single country and are located next to each other. (The debate) will never end in my opinion. And personally, it\u2019s exciting to see how both countries have different ways of doing things.\u201d\n\nLiew agrees.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important is how it\u2019s celebrated and enjoyed by people today. It\u2019s the shared experience that matters most,\u201d he adds.\n\nTossing for flavor and fun\n\nWhile prosperity toss is customarily served on the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, also known as \u201cThe People\u2019s Birthday\u201d (or Renri), many festival revelers toss their plate of vegetables and raw fish slices whenever they have a chance over the holiday period.\n\nLiew says that his father first introduced Yusheng to KEK\u2019s menu in Singapore in the 1990s. Their version has evolved over time, but the core ingredients remain \u2014 thinly sliced raw fish with shredded vegetables such as carrots and turnips, and a range of condiments such as jellyfish, preserved ginger, peanuts and sesame seeds.\n\nBut the secret to a good toss lies in the sauce, and most restaurants have their own in-house recipe.\n\n\u201cA good prosperity toss is all about balance between the textures of the vegetables, the crunchiness of the peanuts, and the amount of yusheng sauce (which is produced in our kitchen),\u201d he says.\n\nLiew, who manages the front-of-house with his family while his brother Wayne Liew helms the kitchen, says the tossing part isn\u2019t just for fun, but flavor as well. A good toss allows the shredded vegetables to release their moisture, which binds well with the sauce.\n\nFounded by Bimmy Soh, Aaron Phua and Aaron Khor, Fifty Tales in Malaysia serves a special version of prosperity toss during the Lunar New Year season. Fifty Tales Seapark\n\nMeanwhile, Khor says his young restaurant \u2014 co-founded with his two friends Aaron Phua and Bimmy Soh \u2014 started serving prosperity toss during last year\u2019s Lunar New Year period.\n\nNamed \u201cFifty Tales Yee Sang,\u201d it\u2019s made with fresh vegetables such as radishes, carrots, white turnips, cucumbers, red cabbage, pickles and fried yam, then topped with an in-house sauce of salted calamansi (a type of citrus fruit), guava, five spice and plum.\n\n\u201cLast year, we did the yee sang with cured raw snapper. This year, we\u2019ve taken things up a notch by serving it with abalone,\u201d says Khor.\n\nThese days, it\u2019s being served far beyond Malaysia and Singapore\n\nChinese restaurants around the world \u2014 from San Francisco to Hong Kong \u2014 have started embracing the trend and offer their own versions of the prosperity toss during Lunar New Year.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong-Canadian chef Susur Lee serves Singapore slaw, inspired by the prosperity toss, all year round at his restaurant in Toronto. It\u2019s one of the most iconic dishes on his menu. His version comprises two dozen ingredients, including deep-fried taro noodles, fried vermicelli, perilla leaves and a fruity dressing.\n\n\u2018Ingredients can go flying \u2026 to the ceiling fans\u2019\n\nNowadays, the prosperity toss continues to be an extremely significant ritual for Lunar New Year in Singapore and Malaysia, with both chefs saying the tradition remains popular among younger generations, too.\n\n\u201cWithout it to begin the meal, we wouldn\u2019t be celebrating Chinese New Year,\u201d says Khor. \u201cEvery gathering, every dinner with our families during this festive season must include the prosperity toss.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s his personal record? The chef says he once ate three prosperity tosses in a single day.\n\n\u201cI mean I like salads, but not that many,\u201d Khor says with a laugh.\n\nLiew is also quick to stress that it\u2019s so much more than just a dish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ritual that brings people together, symbolizing unity\u2026 and the welcoming of a fresh start,\u201d he says.\n\nEven his father, known for his stern and serious demeanor, joins in the messy tradition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very important to him, even if he didn\u2019t show it in a loud way,\u201d Liew says.\n\n\u201cHe would join in, though he\u2019d definitely be a bit more reserved with his tossing\u2026 I think I see him get more animated with the grandkids around (nowadays). The tossing is such a joyful tradition, and it brings out a different side of everyone, no matter how serious they are.\u201d\n\nThe only downside to this joyous food fight? The cleanup.\n\n\u201cIt can get pretty messy, especially if there are a lot of people at the table,\u201d says Liew, laughing.\n\n\u201cThe ingredients can go flying, and sometimes there\u2019s a bit of a scramble to make sure everyone gets involved. These ingredients may even be found on ceiling fans at the end of our meal service.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s part of the fun. The higher you toss, the greater the fortune, so it\u2019s always a good laugh to see who can toss their ingredients the highest. It\u2019s all in good spirits, of course.\u201d",

The Pastry World Cup.\n\nThe biennial event features contestants from as far afield as Egypt, Mauritius and South Korea in a sweet showdown where teams compete to create the best once-in-a-lifetime desserts. This year\u2019s competition took place on January 20 and 21.\n\nEach team had three members \u2014 specialists in chocolate, ice, and sugar respectively. The trios were tasked with developing three desserts that would represent their country: a frozen dessert, a restaurant dessert \u2014 which can have a special garnish added at the judging table \u2014 and a show chocolate.\n\nAnd they only had five hours to pull it all off.\n\nThe pastry chefs relied on both ingredients and designs to highlight their countries\u2019 culinary delights. The Chinese team put together an elaborate dragon made of sugar, while Mexico\u2019s competitors incorporated chocolate, corn and other native foods into their desserts.\n\nTeam China wore festive headwear while working on their desserts. Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/Shutterstock\n\nIn addition to representing their homelands on plates, competitors wore themed outfits and accessories.\n\nFrance\u2019s team members sported chic Breton striped shirts and berets, Mexico\u2019s chefs wore Day of the Dead sugar skull-inspired masks, and Team UK worked on their desserts while wearing natty newsboy caps and bow ties.\n\nThe winner\u2019s circle\n\nAlthough the 2025 event was held in Lyon, the French team did not win the gold medal, settling for silver.\n\nTop honors went to returning champions Japan, whose team put together a lemon, pear, marigold and chocolate granita in the shape of an Asanoha (hemp) leaf for their restaurant dessert entry. For the frozen dessert, the team offered an apricot treat resembling a spinning top toy.\n\n\u201cWe packed the history and culture of Japan into the design. We were able to incorporate taste and delicate traditional patterns to showcase our techniques,\u201d said chef Masanori Hata, the chocolate expert on his team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the moment we won. I was so surprised and couldn\u2019t believe it. Japan was recognized two tournaments in a row. I\u2019m happy and proud.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the French team prepared a showstopping series of chocolate eggs that were filled with chocolate-hazelnut souffl\u00e9 mousse topped with chocolate streusel, dipped in a citrus-vanilla-infused clarified butter and paired with grilled vanilla ice cream and a clementine confit.\n\nTeam France rendered the country's national animal, the rooster, in dessert form.

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nSeeing an overabundance of red lately? From clothing shops to city streets, the fiery hue is going to be on display a lot in the coming days.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of the fun as the world gears up to celebrate Lunar New Year, widely considered the most important event of the year in China and Chinese communities around the planet.\n\nMarking the first new moon of the lunar calendar, it falls on January 29 in 2025, kicking off the 15-day Spring Festival. Celebrations vary depending on the country or region, but there are a few common traditions.\n\nWhether you\u2019re unfamiliar with the occasion or need a refresher, this guide to ushering in the Year of the Snake has you covered.\n\nWhy is it the Year of the Snake?\n\nIncredibly complex, the Chinese zodiac calendar is best described as a 12-year cycle represented by 12 animals, in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig.\n\nYour personal zodiac animal sign is determined by your year of birth, meaning 2025 will welcome plenty of baby Snakes. Children born in the last lunar calendar year were Dragons, while those born on or after the Lunar New Year in 2026 will be Horses, and so on.\n\nSnake-shaped installations dazzle visitors at Shanghai's 2025 Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival. VCG/AP\n\nFollowers believe that for each Chinese zodiac sign, luck will depend largely on the positions of the Tai Sui \u2014 a collective name for the stellar deities thought to rotate parallel to and in the opposite direction of Jupiter.\n\nGeomancy masters may interpret the data differently, but there is usually a consensus on what the year means for each zodiac animal based on the positions of the stars.\n\nFor many followers, the Lunar New Year is an ideal time to visit a temple to make blessings depending on what the stars have to say about their particular zodiac sign for the coming months. (More on that below.)\n\nWhy light firecrackers and wear red? Meet Nian\n\nThere are countless folktales attached to Lunar New Year, but the myth of Nian stands out as one of the most fun.\n\nAccording to the legend, every Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve this ferocious underwater beast with sharp teeth and horns would crawl onto the land and attack a nearby village.\n\nOn one such occasion as the villagers rushed into hiding, a mysterious old man showed up and insisted on sticking around despite warnings of impending doom.\n\nTo the villagers\u2019 surprise, the old man and the village survived utterly unscathed.\n\nThe man claimed to have scared Nian away by hanging red banners on his door, lighting firecrackers and donning red clothing.\n\nThis is why wearing the fiery color, along with hanging banners and lighting firecrackers or fireworks, are Lunar New Year traditions, all of which are still followed today.\n\nThe preparation\n\nFun aside, Lunar New Year can actually be a lot of work. Festivities often last for 15 days \u2014 sometimes even more \u2014 with different tasks and activities taking place over that period.\n\nIt all begins about a week ahead of the new year.\n\nFestive cakes and puddings are made on the 24th day of the last lunar month (January 23 in 2025). Why? The word for cakes and puddings is gao in Mandarin and gou in Cantonese, which sound the same as the word for \u201ctall.\u201d\n\nThis means eating these treats is believed to lead to improvements and growth in the coming year. (If you haven\u2019t prepared your own \u201cgou\u201d yet, here\u2019s an easy recipe for turnip cake, a beloved Lunar New Year dish.)\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about our friend Nian. No Lunar New Year preparation would be complete without the aforementioned hanging of red banners bearing auspicious phrases and idioms (called fai chun in Cantonese and chunlian in Mandarin) at home \u2014 beginning with one\u2019s front door.\n\nThese will perform double duty \u2014 keep Nian away and invite good fortune.\n\nSome of the prep work isn\u2019t quite as enjoyable. Many believe that a big cleanup should take place at home on the 28th day of the last lunar month, which falls on January 27 this year.\n\nThe aim is to rid your home of any bad luck that\u2019s accumulated over the past year. Some believers won\u2019t even sweep or take out the trash for the first five days of the new year, fearing they will wash away all that fresh good luck.\n\nOn a related note, many say you shouldn\u2019t wash or cut your hair on the first day of the new year either.\n\nWhy? Because the Chinese character for the word \u201chair\u201d is the first character in the word for prosper. Therefore washing or cutting it off is seen as washing your fortune away.\n\n(Read more Lunar New Year do\u2019s and don\u2019ts here.)\n\nLunar New Year\u2019s Eve: The big feast\n\nA big family reunion dinner is usually held on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, which falls on January 28 this year.\n\nThe menu is carefully chosen to include dishes associated with luck, including fish (the Chinese word for it also sounds like \u201csurplus\u201d), puddings (symbolizes advancement) and foods that look like gold ingots (such as dumplings).\n\nIn China, the foods served at these classic dinners vary from north to south. For instance, northern Chinese tend to have dumplings and noodles, whereas southern Chinese can\u2019t live without steamed rice.\n\nLunar New Year feasts may look very different outside of China. In Malaysia and Singapore, gatherings aren\u2019t complete without a loud and chaotic \u201cprosperity toss,\u201d or yusheng, when diners stir and toss thinly sliced vegetables and raw fish with chopsticks before a meal.\n\nLunar New Year\u2019s Day: Family visits and red packets\n\nThe first few days of the Lunar New Year, especially the first two days, are often a test of one\u2019s stamina, appetite and social skills, as many people have to travel and visit immediate family, other relatives and friends.\n\nBags are stocked with presents and fruits to give out at other people\u2019s homes. Visitors will in turn be showered with gifts after exchanging conversations over Lunar New Year treats.\n\nIn many families, married people are expected to give out red packets filled with money to those who haven\u2019t yet tied the knot \u2014 both children and unmarried juniors.\n\nIt\u2019s believed these envelopes \u2014 known as hongbao/lai see \u2014 could protect children by warding off evil spirits, called sui.\n\nOther countries have their own traditions. In South Korea, for instance, the Lunar New Year festival is called Seollal. The first three days are filled with tributes to ancestors, festive games and foods such as rice cakes (tteokguk) and pancakes (jeon).\n\nDay 3: Visit a temple\n\nDay three of the Lunar New Year (which falls on January 31 in 2025) is named chi kou/cek hau, or red mouth.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that arguments are more likely to happen on this day, so some people will avoid social interactions and instead visit temples to make offerings to offset any potential bad luck.\n\nAs noted earlier, for many people Lunar New Year is a time to consult the stars to find out what lies ahead in the coming months.\n\nEvery year, certain Chinese zodiac signs clash with the stars negatively so temple visits are considered a good way to resolve those conflicts and bring peace in the coming months.\n\nDay 7: The people\u2019s birthday\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Longevity noodles: the lucky Lunar New Year dish 00:59 - Source: CNN Longevity noodles: the lucky Lunar New Year dish 00:59\n\nThe seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it\u2019s called renri/jan jat (the people\u2019s birthday).\n\nDifferent communities in Asia will serve various \u201cbirthday\u201d foods on that day.\n\nFor example, Cantonese people eat dishes made of seven types of vegetables. In Malaysia and Singapore, the \u201cprosperity toss\u201d might make an appearance on tables.\n\nDay 15: The Lantern Festival\n\nThe highlight of the whole Spring Festival, the Lantern Festival happens on the 15th and final day (February 12 in 2025).\n\nCalled Yuan Xiao Jie in Mandarin Chinese, it\u2019s considered the perfect ending to the weeks-long Lunar New Year preparations and celebrations.\n\nThe Lantern Festival celebrates the first full moon of the year \u2014 hence the name (Yuan means beginning. Xiao means night).\n\nIt marks the departure of winter and the beginning of the spring season.\n\nOn this day, people light lanterns to symbolize driving out darkness and bringing hope to the coming year.\n\nIn ancient Chinese society, it was the only day when young girls were allowed to go out to admire the lanterns and meet boys. As a result, it\u2019s also been dubbed Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nNowadays, cities worldwide still put on massive lantern displays and fairs on the festival\u2019s final day.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThieves have stolen four ancient artifacts, including an approximately 2,500-year-old gold helmet, after using explosives to break into a museum in the Netherlands.\n\nThe daring heist took place at Drents Museum in Assen during the early hours of Saturday morning, according to Dutch police, who said they received a report of an explosion at 3:45 a.m. local time.\n\nCCTV footage released by police shows the suspects opening an exterior door before a blast sends sparks and smoke into the air. The thieves made off with three gold bracelets, dating from around 50 BC, as well as the 5th-century BC Helmet of Cotofenesti, a historically important artifact on loan from the National History Museum of Romania in Bucharest.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See thieves blow up door in daring museum heist 00:40 - Source: CNN See thieves blow up door in daring museum heist 00:40\n\nThe items were part of an exhibition about the Dacians, an ancient society that occupied much of present-day Romania before being conquered by the Romans. On show since July, \u201cDacia: Empire of Gold and Silver\u201d featured treasures borrowed from institutions across Romania.\n\nIn a press release on its website, Drents Museum described the Helmet of Cotofenesti \u2014 which was discovered in a Romanian village almost a century ago \u2014 as a \u201cmasterpiece.\u201d Its design features mythological scenes and a pair of eyes, located above the wearers\u2019, that were thought to deter enemies during battle while protecting against the \u201cevil eye.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition was set to conclude Sunday, though Drents Museum remained closed through the weekend due to the robbery. Its premises were damaged by the explosion, though no injuries were reported, the museum said.\n\nDutch police announced that they are working with global police agency Interpol and had, as of Sunday, received more than 50 tip-offs. Investigators are currently looking for information about a gray car that was stolen from the nearby city of Alkmaar earlier in the week and was discovered around four miles from the crime scene, on fire, shortly after the overnight heist.\n\nOne of the three Dacian royal bracelets stolen during the heist. Dutch Police\n\nPolice believe the suspects abandoned the vehicle, which had stolen license plates, and fled in a different getaway car.\n\nIn a press statement, Drents Museum\u2019s general director Harry Tupan, described the incident as a \u201cdark day\u201d \u2014 both for his institution and the National History Museum of Romania.\n\n\u201cWe are intensely shocked by the events last night at the museum,\u201d he added. \u201cIn its 170-year existence, there has never been such a major incident. It also gives us enormous sadness towards our colleagues in Romania.\u201d",

                "text": "Paris CNN \u2014\n\nThroughout his legendary fashion career, Karl Lagerfeld maintained that \u201cArt is Art, Fashion is Fashion.\u201d But a new exhibition, \u201c Louvre Couture, Art and Fashion: Statement Pieces,\u201d might just prove the late German fashion designer wrong. Running until July 21, the exhibition features 45 designers \u2014 from Chanel and Balenciaga to Versace and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 revealing an unprecedented dialogue between art and fashion from the 1960s to today.\n\nSeventy garments and 30 accessories by a host of renowned designers are presented in this landmark show \u2014 the first fashion exhibition ever staged at the Louvre \u2014 with creations often hidden among the museum\u2019s nearly 100,000 square feet of rooms and galleries.\n\nWhile this is the first time the Louvre is exhibiting fashion garments, clothing is omnipresent in its galleries, from Vermeer\u2019s \u201cThe Lacemaker\u201d to Ingres\u2019 nude, turban-wearing \u201cGrand Odalisque.\u201d What is worn \u2014 or not worn \u2014 has always been a central component of the creation and reception of art.\n\nFashion creations, including a dress from Alexander McQueen's Spring-Summer 2010 collection (left) on show at the Louvre museum. Yoan Valat/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the Louvre to continue to open itself up to new generations and to make its own small contribution to understanding today\u2019s world. That is exactly what this exhibition does,\u201d said Laurence des Cars, the museum\u2019s president, in an interview at the Louvre.\n\nThe collection weaves the threads between fashion and a diverse array of \u201cart objects\u201d \u2014 including tapestries, ceramics, portraits, sculptures and the layout of the Louvre\u2019s galleries themselves. Visitors are invited to fl\u00e2ner \u2014 or wander aimlessly, as the French saying goes \u2014 through the museum and discover its less popular collections.\n\n\u201cThe Louvre is so much more than just the \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019,\u201d Olivier Gabet, the museum\u2019s director of art objects as well as the exhibition\u2019s curator, said with a smile.\n\nA fashionable exchange\n\nWhile painter Paul C\u00e9zanne once observed that \u201cthe Louvre is the book in which we learn to read,\u201d for fashion designers, the museum is the \u201cultimate mood board,\u201d observed Gabet. From Lagerfeld to Alexander McQueen, designers have long been inspired by the wealth of collections displayed at the world\u2019s biggest museum. Some, like Christian Louboutin, shared with Gabet childhood memories of days spent in its halls. Others, like Yves Saint Laurent, were themselves great art connoisseurs and collectors. For Gabet, the personal relationship between the designers and the Louvre was the starting point for the exhibition.\n\nIt\u2019s a connection epitomized by the Dior silhouette that opens the exhibition, said Gabet. Entitled, \u201cMus\u00e9e du Louvre,\u201d Gabet said that, to his knowledge, it is the \u201conly piece in the history of haute couture to be named after a museum.\n\nThe exhibition pays homage to major historical periods, inviting visitors to rediscover the Louvre\u2019s artifacts through the prism of contemporary designers. Highlights include a crystal-embroidered Dolce & Gabbana dress inspired by 11th-century mosaics from Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello, Venice. A spectacular silk Dior gown featuring a Sun King motif is staged before a baroque portrait of Louis XIV himself.\n\nA creation from the Autumn-Winter 2006-2007 Haute Couture collection by John Galliano for Christian Dior is exhibited.

Yoan Valat/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nIconic pieces such as Gianni Versace\u2019s 1997 metal mesh gown \u2014 previously displayed at the 2018 \u201cHeavenly Bodies\u201d Met Gala exhibition \u2014 are also on display. The garment took two of the atelier\u2019s seamstresses more than 600 hours \u2014 or 25 days \u2014 to stitch by hand and is embellished with Swarovski crystals, golden embroidery featuring Byzantine crosses and Versace\u2019s signature draping inspired by Ancient Greek peplum dresses.\n\nThe gown inspired both Kim Kardashian\u2019s gold Versace dress at the 2018 Met Gala and Donatella Versace\u2019s iconic \u201cTribute\u201d collection the same year, which featured five of the original supermodels: Naomi Campbell, Carla Bruni, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen.\n\nDetails, details\n\nKarl Lagerfeld drew inspiration from an ornate blue and white cabinet. Nicolas Matheus/Muse\u0301e du Louvre\n\nA close-up shot of the Chanel jacket. Nicolas Matheus/Muse\u0301e du Louvre\n\nSometimes, designers\u2019 references to objects in the Louvre are literal. Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s 2019 collection for Chanel, for instance, featured a striking embroidered jacket whose motif is drawn from an 18th-century blue and white chest by cabinet maker Mathieu Criaerd. Lagerfeld, who considered the Louvre his \u201csecond studio,\u201d sketched his initial designs for the dress on a museum catalog featuring the chest, before sending the final version to the Chanel atelier.\n\nGlamour can even be found in the Middle Ages, with armour-style dresses transforming models into modern Joan of Arcs. French actress Brigitte Bardot was famously photographed by David Bailey in a 1967 Paco Rabanne chainmail tunic, which is featured in the exhibition next to a 3D-printed armour Balenciaga gown.\n\nMore often, the broad sweep of history serves as recurrent inspiration for designers, such as Italian Renaissance paintings for Maria Grazia Chiuri at Christian Dior, Medieval tapestries for Dries van Noten, or 18th-century delicacies evoked by John Galliano and Christian Louboutin.\n\nWith Paris Fashion Week around the corner, \u201cLouvre Couture\u201d offers a source of inspiration for designers and visitors alike, illuminating the ongoing dialogue between art and fashion.\n\n\u201cThe exhibition is not here to say that fashion is or isn\u2019t art,\u201d Gabet concluded. \u201cFashion is about creation. The artistic culture shared between great designers \u2014 that\u2019s the leitmotif of the collection.\u201d\n\nAnd this is just the beginning of the conversation. In March, the famed Parisian museum will host hundreds of guests for the Grand D\u00eener, an event that is already being referred to as the first French Met Gala.",

See all coverage here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nCult American designer Rick Owens transformed his Paris Fashion Week set into an industrial dystopian futurescape on Thursday, with models walking in platform boots, wide-collared jackets and visor-like wraparound sunglasses.\n\nAmid the exaggerated sci-fi silhouettes, however, the afternoon\u2019s most avant-garde look was arguably not on the runway, but on the star-studded front row.\n\nSinger FKA Twigs cut an otherworldly figure as she arrived with a part-shaven bouffant, signature bleached eyebrows and an array of \u2014 presumably temporary \u2014 face tattoos.\n\nThe English pop star\u2019s bold neo-gothic outfit comprised items from previous Owens collections, including tinted glasses, a rust-colored minidress and a shearling jacket. More eye-catching still were the $6,000 over-the-knee Rhino Cargoflare boots (from Owens\u2019 Fall-Winter 2024 collection) that moved like the bellows of an accordion as she ascended the steps at Paris\u2019 historic Palais de Tokyo.\n\nFKA twigs poses on the steps of the Palais de Tokyo ahead of Rick Owens' Fall-Winter 2025 menswear show at Paris Fashion Week.

The 37-year-old, who has modeled for Calvin Klein and Swiss running brand On, is a regular fixture at the designer\u2019s shows.\n\nShe is also frequently seen wearing his creations, and in a Spotify interview released earlier this week, she even made a point of highlighting an on-set stool selected from Owens\u2019 furniture collection.

In his Paris show notes, Owens recalled sleeping on a couch in the factory office for five years to \u201cimmerse\u201d himself in \u201cthe rhythm of an industrial production schedule.\u201d",

Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters\n\nBuilt in Paris in the late 12th century, the Louvre Palace for centuries was the official residence of the kings of France, until Louis XIV\u2014weary of rebellious crowds in Paris\u2014 abandoned it for Versailles, after which it became a museum for the royal art collection in 1793.\n\nLast year, the Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors, who all entered via the pyramid-shaped western entrance, designed by architect I.M. Pei, which itself has become problematic as its greenhouse effect makes the Louvre\u2019s subterranean reception uncomfortably hot on summer days.\n\nA visit to the Louvre, the museum\u2019s head wrote, has become \u201ca physical ordeal,\u201d with artworks being hard to find due to inadequate signage, lack of space for visitors to take a break, and insufficient food and sanitary facilities.\n\nDesigned to receive four million visitors a year, the Louvre saw record attendance of 10.2 million visitors in 2018, but des Cars\u2014who was appointed in 2021\u2014has imposed a limit of 30,000 visitors per day in order to avoid overcrowding.\n\nDes Cars\u2019 letter did not mention financing, but French TV news channel BFM said renovation costs could amount to \u20ac500 million ($525 million), which would be a challenge for President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government, which has struggled to gets its 2025 budget approved by parliament.\n\nLe Parisien reported that talks are underway between Macron\u2019s office, the culture ministry and the Louvre. A source close to Macron\u2019s office confirmed that \u201cthe president has followed this issue with attention for several months.\u201d\n\nThe culture ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter his first election in 2017, Macron gave his victory speech in front of the Louvre, while the Tuileries gardens around the former palace also played a prominent role during the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nBesides a top-to-bottom renovation, the museum is also considering building a new wing for the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d as well as a new entrance on the eastern end of the museum, to relieve congestion at the Pyramid entrance.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFor most of us, the chances of having Martha Stewart visit our garden is vanishingly small. Until now. After years of research, a highly fragrant pink and apricot hybrid tea rose named after the lifestyle doyenne has hit the market.\n\nIn May 2023 Stewart decided to install a rose garden at her Bedford, New York estate and invited Danielle Dall\u2019Armi Hahn, the owner of Rose Story Farms and author of \u201cThe Color of Roses,\u201d to advise her. While Hahn was in New York for the garden build, the two began to discuss an idea over dinner. \u201cI said, \u2018Martha, what do you think about having your own rose?\u2019. And she said, \u2018Amazing, I would love that\u2019,\u201d explained Hahn.\n\nCreating a new rose is a massive undertaking \u2014 from inception to market usually takes years. So, while Stewart\u2019s involvement in the project began a few years ago, the rose named after her has been around a decade in the making.\n\nThe creation of a rose begins by considering \u201cthe traits you want\u201d the flower to have, explained Consulting Rosarian (a certified expert in rose care) and independent hybridizer Christopher Huffer, before choosing your parent plants with those traits. Once the parents are crossed through the pollination process, seeds will form in rose hips (the seed pods of roses) with each seed having the potential to become a new rose. Then there are years of testing before a potential new rose can ever be sold commercially.\n\nDanielle Dall\u2019Armi Hahn handing Julia Child roses as Child picked a rose to be her namesake in 2004. Courtesy Danielle Dall\u2019Armi Hahn\n\nHahn is no stranger to working with celebrities. She and her father Lorenzo Dall\u2019Armi collaborated with chef and author Julia Child when Child decided to pick the now iconic yellow rose to be her namesake. Stewart, meanwhile, already has a number of plants carrying her name including a begonia, a daffodil and an orchid. But to have a rose named after you is \u201ca really big honor,\u201d said Hahn. \u201cAnd for people who love roses, it is the highest honor\u201d.\n\nFinding the perfect rose to become Martha\u2019s namesake was difficult according to Hahn, who visited various fields and looked at dozens of contenders. When searching for the right rose, there are a number of factors to consider, including color. Stewart has a \u201cvery defined color palette,\u201d said Hahn, \u201cbut anything in like the medium-pink to peach, to apricot, even a creamy apricot, I think she would have been open to.\u201d\n\nBut the search ended when they came across a compact hybrid tea in Martha\u2019s preferred color palette at Star Roses and Plants, an American horticultural company involved in plant breeding, distribution and intellectual property. What would become the Martha Stewart rose was first sent to the United States as a test rose called CP 15 8603 in December 2015, one of many sent by European rose breeding company Meilland International for evaluation.\n\n\u201cOn average, it\u2019s maybe 150 codes (roses) we get from them every year,\u201d Kristen Smith, a rose evaluation manager for Star Roses and Plants, told CNN. But Meilland is just one of the rose breeders the company works with. On average, it looks at close to 700 roses annually, according to Smith.\n\nMartha Stewart attends the 2024 WWD Honors in New York in October 2024. John Nacion/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nAfter entering the US, roses are placed in a two-year quarantine period before testing begins. During the testing phase roses are reviewed for certain criteria, including growth and development in different weather conditions, as well as disease resistance. The rose that would become Stewart\u2019s was placed at Star Roses\u2019 testing fields in Pennsylvania and California.\n\nIn 2021, as it became apparent that CP 15 8603 was special, the Star Roses team decided to patent it. \u201cAt that time, we hadn\u2019t necessarily 100% decided to introduce it, but we knew that it was an important variety,\u201d said Susan Bacus Morgan, marketing manager for Star Roses and Plants.\n\n\u201cOn average, it\u2019s about five varieties that are going in to the catalog every year,\u201d said Smith, meaning that on average less than 1% of the roses tested make it into Star\u2019s portfolio annually. \u201cIt\u2019s a really long and loving process to launch a rose,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cWe want to release the very best.\u201d\n\nWhile many people had a hand in finding the perfect rose to carry Stewart\u2019s name, it was ultimately Martha\u2019s choice. \u201cMartha personally chose and approved the rose,\u201d confirmed a spokesperson from a public relations agency that represents Stewart, in an email to CNN.\n\n\u201cI am so happy that such a great rose is named after me and that many of you will be adding it to your garden!\u201d, said Stewart in an Instagram post on her verified account last week. Stewart also thanked Hahn who \u201cworked with me for two years to make this happen\u201d.\n\nWhile new to the North American market, this same rose has been available since 2021 in Europe, where it is known as \u201cJean de la Fontaine.\u201d\n\nThe idea for a Martha Stewart rose came about around the same time the star began installing a rose garden at her New York estate in 2023. Pictured: Martha\u2019s rose garden during the installation process. Courtesy Danielle Dall\u2019Armi Hahn\n\n\u201cOftentimes a rose introduced in Europe will receive a different name in America,\u201d said Morgan. When choosing a name for commercial use, cultivators pick \u201csomething to catch people\u2019s attention,\u201d said Beth Smiley, publications director of the American Rose Society. \u201cThe Martha Stewart rose is going to attract a lot of attention\u201d.\n\nThere is no \u201cfinancial benefit for having a rose named after you \u2014 absolutely zero,\u201d said Hahn. In a statement provided to CNN, Star Roses said: \u201cThis rose has been named in honor of Martha Stewart, recognizing her extraordinary contributions to lifestyle, design, homemaking, and gardening\u2026 Our hope is that this rose will honor her legacy and serve as a source of inspiration for generations to come.\u201d\n\nWhile there are only a limited number of Martha Stewart rose plants are available for pre-order, if you miss out this year, the variety is expected to be available at independent garden centers in 2026.\n\nAs a repeat bloomer, you can expect the Martha Stewart rose to flower in flushes through the growing season. Smith said that while the rose has performed well in hot, dry climates like California, \u201cit does get some leaf spot in areas that are more susceptible to fungal diseases, but it is better than older varieties of hybrid tea types.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the scent that\u2019s the standout for this plant. \u201cIt\u2019s not a traditional rose fragrance,\u201d said Hahn. \u201cIt\u2019s fruitier, it\u2019s light, it\u2019s luscious. You feel like you could eat it.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA major winter storm slammed the US Gulf Coast Tuesday, blanketing parts of a region largely unaccustomed to extreme winter weather with record-breaking snowfall.\n\nThe storm impacted 1,500 miles of the Deep South from the Texas Gulf Coast to the Atlantic coast of the Carolinas, causing widespread closures and travel disruptions, including stranded motorists and thousands of canceled flights.\n\nThe storm, along with the brutal cold that helped cause it, is blamed for at least 11 deaths.\n\nThe snowfall that dazzled Southerners unaccustomed to significant accumulation is over, but the cold is sticking around and keeping slippery conditions in place. Many cities are begging residents to avoid driving as the sun melts snow that then refreezes, increasing the danger on roadways.\n\nA beach walker heads to the ocean on Isle of Palms, South Carolina, Wednesday after a winter storm dropped ice and snow. Mic Smith/AP\n\nIn New Orleans, which saw record snowfall and frigid temperatures, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Wednesday the city is focusing on response and recovery.\n\n\u201cThe city has been through challenging situations before,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cThrough the dedication and tireless efforts of our people, we will get through this history snow event.\u201d\n\nCity crews in New Orleans are working to clear bridges and roads while warning residents should still shelter in place.\n\nSnowfall records broken\n\nMultiple locations in Florida recorded enough snow to preliminarily shatter the state\u2019s all-time snowfall record of 4 inches set in 1954.\n\nMore than a foot of snow fell in Louisiana, the high mark from the storm.\n\nNew Orleans shattered its modern all-time daily snowfall record on Tuesday, receiving 8 inches of snow, far surpassing the previous record of 2.7 inches. The city has recorded more snowfall this month than Anchorage, Alaska, which has seen nearly two inches in January. The Big Easy typically sees measurable snow only about once per decade.\n\nOther Southern cities also broke long-standing snowfall records:\n\nMobile, Alabama, reported 7.5 inches, exceeding the previous 3.6-inch record from 1973.\n\nPensacola, Florida, recorded 7.6 inches, surpassing its 2.3-inch record from 1954.\n\nMilton, Florida, recorded the most snow in Florida: a preliminary total of 10 inches\n\nThe Mobile Civic Center roof collapsed under the weight of heavy snow Wednesday morning. \u201cThe collapse occurred in a manner consistent with the plans for the building\u2019s ongoing demolition,\u201d the city said in a social media post. No one was injured.\n\nDeadly conditions\n\nNationwide, at least 11 deaths have been reported due to the severe cold affecting large parts of the country and the winter storm. On Tuesday, at least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions in Zavala County, Texas, Sheriff Eusevio Salinas told CNN. Four of the victims were ejected from their vehicle as it wrecked on a bridge. Wednesday morning, a woman was also killed when a minivan she was in collided with a tractor-trailer on US Highway 57 east of La Pryor, Texas, Salinas said.\n\nA 27-year-old woman died in Ozark, Alabama, after her car slid on a snow-covered highway Tuesday and hit a pickup truck head-on after crossing the center line, according to the Dale County Coroner\u2019s Office and Ozark Police Department.\n\nAuthorities are also investigating two deaths in Austin as potentially cold-related, though the medical examiner\u2019s office has not confirmed the causes. In Georgia, officials reported one hypothermia-related death, noting the individual had been outside the previous night.\n\nPeople walk as snow falls in New Orleans Tuesday. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nWhile the wintry storm has had a visceral impact on the Gulf region, below-freezing temperatures are also affecting much of the US. An 80-year-old man in Milwaukee is suspected to have died from hypothermia after falling outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nBelow-freezing weather helped law enforcement in Oklahoma catch a fugitive. A man accused of slamming a vehicle into a Pottawatomie County Sheriff\u2019s deputy\u2019s cruiser during a pursuit and then leading authorities on a foot chase was caught less than three hours later, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThe chase ended after the suspect entered a stranger\u2019s home and asked them to call the sheriff because he had decided it was too cold to stay on the run, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN affiliate KOCO.\n\nAs temperatures plunged below freezing this week, the plight of those experiencing homelessness became increasingly dire.\n\nIn San Antonio, Mariah Pena and Daniel Vertiz felt the weight of this reality when Pena found a woman seeking refuge in their dog kennel on the porch Sunday, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Startled yet desperate, the woman explained that she had nowhere else to turn.\n\nThough the couple hesitated to invite a stranger into their home, they felt an imperative to help, thinking that even a makeshift shelter would offer respite from the life-threatening cold. \u201cWho knows what could have happened if she were left out on the streets?\u201d Vertiz told the outlet.\n\nThere were about 1,300 people using warming shelters in Houston Wednesday morning, Mary Benton with the Houston mayor\u2019s office told CNN. The two largest centers were filled, but Houston Mayor John Whitmire said no one was turned away. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in weather like this as reaching capacity,\u201d Whitmire said Wednesday.\n\nTwo warming centers in New Orleans quickly reached capacity on Wednesday causing the city to open a third. Mobile Crisis Units and the health department are working to transport people to the newly opened center, a city spokesperson said.\n\nAirport disruptions\n\nAirports in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida closed Tuesday due to unprecedented snowfall. Issues from the closures rippled into Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1,800 flights have been canceled nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon, primarily affecting routes to and from Texas and Louisiana along with Atlanta, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, according to FlightAware.\n\nIn Mississippi, Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport closed its terminal and runway until conditions improved. Jacksonville International Airport reopened at noon on Wednesday, while Tallahassee International, Mobile Regional and Mobile International Airports will remain closed until midday Thursday, due to \u201congoing weather conditions,\u201d Wednesday updates said. Lafayette Regional Airport in Louisiana also remained shut down due to icy conditions.\n\nAll departing flights at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport were canceled Wednesday, but flights resumed at both of Houston\u2019s major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby.\n\nWidespread road closures\n\nWith cold weather conditions across the region this week, roads could remain hazardous as snow melts and refreezes.\n\nIn Louisiana, Interstate 10 from the Louisiana/Texas state line to Baton Rouge \u2013 a roughly 150-mile stretch \u2013 was closed in both directions due to \u201cdeteriorating road conditions\u201d Wednesday, according to the state Department of Transportation and Development. Nearly 30 state roadways were closed as of Tuesday, including the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway \u2013 the nation\u2019s longest bridge over water.\n\nTo help treat roads, New Orleans has hired 14 snow plows from an Indiana-based company, Collin Arnold, the city director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, told reporters Tuesday. The initial focus will be on clearing critical routes, while crews will tackle main thoroughfares, he said.\n\nA car drives on a snowy road in Tallahassee, Florida. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, roads in Alabama\u2019s Escambia, Mobile and Baldwin counties were deemed \u201cimpassable\u201d and closed due to the storm\u2019s impact, officials said.\n\nNineteen counties in Mississippi were still reporting ice on roads and bridges Wednesday morning, with black ice remaining a significant threat, the Mississippi Department of Transportation said on social media. \u201cUntil the sun warms us up enough to thaw things down today, please only drive if it\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\n\nThe Georgia State Patrol responded to more than 100 vehicle crashes in a 14-hour period, the Department of Public Safety said. Metro-Atlanta\u2019s DeKalb County declared a state of emergency Wednesday morning after \u201chundreds\u201d of 911 calls and over 100 vehicles became stranded on icy roadways, with many obstructing emergency response efforts.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly unusual winter weather event impacting nearly three-quarters of the state and our crews cannot be everywhere at once,\u201d Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said. \u201cGeorgia DOT will need time, ability to access the roads to treat or plow, and warmer temperatures working in our favor to help restore and maintain passable conditions.\u201d\n\nCNN Meteorologists Mary Gilbert and Brandon Miller and CNN\u2019s Alexandra Skores, Lauren Mascarenhas, Jamiel Lynch, Karina Tsui and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",

Georgia officials reported one death from hypothermia at a news conference Tuesday, saying the individual was outside the night prior. Another death is also believed to have been caused by hypothermia, involving an 80-year-old man in Milwaukee who fell outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. At least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions early Tuesday morning in Zavala County, Texas, according to CNN affiliate WOAI/KABB, citing authorities.\n\n\u2022 Record snowfall: Snow is falling from southeast Texas through Louisiana and into parts of Mississippi and Alabama Tuesday, creating treacherous conditions. An area stretching from Houston into Alabama has recorded widespread snowfall of 3 to 6 inches, with at least one locale hitting the double-digit mark. Eight inches of snowfall was recorded at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Tuesday according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans; the previous modern record was 2.7 inches in 1963. Florida has likely broken its all-time statewide snow record, with at least 5.5 inches recorded in Molino \u2013 a record that has stood since 1954. Mobile, Alabama, has so far recorded more than five inches of snow, breaking a 143-year-old record for one-day snowfall. A record amount of snow is forecast for New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u2022 Unprecedented blizzard warning issued: Heavy snow and strong wind gusts combined to create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana, where snow totals of 3 to 6 inches are already widespread. It prompted the first-ever blizzard warning anywhere along the Gulf Coast from the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, for parts of southern Louisiana and far eastern Texas.\n\nSNOW in HOUSTON! \ud83e\udd0d\u2744\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HoYn62z35n \u2014 University of Houston (@UHouston) January 21, 2025\n\n\u2022 Widespread closures: Snow has closed or hindered operations at multiple airports in the South, contributing to the more than 2,300 flight cancellations into or out of US airports Tuesday \u2013 and more than 900 cancellations so far Wednesday. Large sections of Interstate 10 \u2014 the Gulf Coast\u2019s major thoroughfare \u2014 in Texas and Louisiana are closed Tuesday as snow and some icy mix make travel difficult to impossible. Major roads were closed across the New Orleans area. Schools and government offices are closed Tuesday throughout the Gulf Coast and states of emergency are active in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\n\n\u2022 Bitter cold: Low temperatures and wind chills from the Canadian border to the Mexican border are hitting dangerous levels for the second consecutive day.

Brian Kemp warned people in the state to stay off roads because the sudden onset of snow later in the day, in places like Atlanta, could catch people off guard. Indeed, there were impacts to the roadways by early evening, particularly south of Interstate 20, according to Georgia Department of Transportation spokesperson Natalie Dale. \u201cPlow crews are having trouble treating some areas due to non-incident related congestion,\u201d she said, encouraging motorists to avoid travel.\n\n\u201cThis could deteriorate very quickly like it did in 2014,\u201d Gov. Kemp said. A few inches of snow that year paralyzed Atlanta with countless traffic incidents that trapped drivers in what became known as \u201cSnowmageddon.\u201d\n\nThe rare winter storm comes as 33 million people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina under winter weather alerts, with more than 200 million people in the US affected by bitterly cold air more broadly. The Upper Midwest and Northern Plains recorded wind chills to 50 degrees below zero Monday and were experiencing 40 degrees below zero Tuesday morning \u2014 temperatures that can cause frostbite on exposed skin in a matter of minutes.\n\nAir and road travel halted; schools shut down\n\nOfficials in affected states in the South cautioned people to stay off the roads, keep faucets dripping to prevent pipes from freezing, check batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes.\n\nGovernors in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have declared states of emergency, while Texas authorities have directed state agencies to mobilize resources for the rare snowfall. In North Carolina, officials have deployed parts of the state National Guard to the eastern reaches of the state to support local emergency services.\n\n\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,\u201d Louisiana climatologist Jay Grymes said Monday.\n\nTravel was paralyzed along the Interstate 10 corridor with portions already receiving widespread snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches. More than half a foot of snow had fallen by Tuesday afternoon along a portion of I-10 in southwestern Louisiana. One location just north of Rayne, Louisiana, recorded 10.5 inches of snow before noon. Cold weather will lock any snow and ice that falls into place, keeping roads hazardous.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon, the Louisiana State Patrol had responded to more than 50 weather-related calls for service and numerous crashes across the state.\n\nSimilar warnings were echoed in neighboring Florida. \u201cOur infrastructure is designed differently than states that are used to this (winter weather),\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a Tuesday news conference. \u201cThe state has done a lot to prepare but \u2026 driving in icy conditions, it can be very, very hazardous.\u201d\n\nCars travel on a snow-covered highway Tuesday in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nDisruptions were also reported in the skies, with more than a dozen airports in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia closed to commercial flights as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThere were more than 2,300 flight cancellations within, into or out of the US Tuesday morning, with most of those flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Nearly all flights to or from New Orleans International Airport were canceled by 10 a.m. CST.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Lafayette Regional Airport was closed Tuesday due to ice and snow on runways, the airport said. Mississippi\u2019s Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport also closed its terminal and runway \u201cuntil weather permits a safe reopening.\u201d The Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama closed around 9:15 a.m. CT, spokesperson Devon Calametti told CNN, with plans to reopen at noon Wednesday.\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee International Airport said it would suspend all operations at 4 p.m. CT with plans to reopen Wednesday at noon.

Jeff Landry said Monday during a news conference about storm preparations.\n\n\u201cThis is the time when you can cook you a big pot of gumbo,\u201d Landry said.\n\nOfficials in affected states urged people to stay off the roads, keep a trickle of water running through faucets to keep pipes from freezing, check the batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes. The precautions are more familiar to people living in northern climates but rare in the South.\n\n\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,\u201d Louisiana climatologist Jay Grymes said Monday.\n\nA National Weather Service forecast warned, \u201cthis should be considered a generational winter storm event and its impacts should be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nTravel could be snarled for days\n\nThe forecast has already prompted more than 1,700 flight cancellations Tuesday, with a majority of the flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the tracking website FlightAware.\n\nHouston\u2019s major airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Hobby Airport will be closed Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been convinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode,\u201d John Whitmire, the mayor of Houston, said at a Sunday news conference.\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest airport, is pretreating roadways and airfield surfaces in preparation for the winter weather, according to spokesperson Andrew Gobeil.\n\n\u201cThe Emergency Operations Center will activate at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning and will remain operational throughout the event,\u201d Gobeil said Monday. \u201cPassengers are urged to arrive in the airport at least two and a half hours prior to domestic departure times unless otherwise directed by their airlines.\u201d\n\nThe snow is expected to fall along the Interstate 10 and Interstate 20 corridors, prompting highway officials to warn motorists of the possibility of road closures in the next few days, in areas where many drivers are not used to driving on snow.\n\nNASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston said it will be closed Tuesday and Wednesday due to the extreme weather. Port Houston said its facilities will be closed on Tuesday as well.\n\nSchools are closed in several states including Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.

Snow, sleet and freezing rain will stretch from coastal Texas to Louisiana and Mississippi by sunrise Tuesday. This hazardous mix will expand east into the rest of the Southeast Tuesday and reach parts of the Carolinas Tuesday night.\n\nWidespread snow totals of 1 to 3 inches will accumulate from southeast Texas \u2014 including Houston \u2014 through southern Louisiana and into parts of southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina from Monday night into Wednesday morning. Totals greater than 3 inches are possible, mainly in far southeast Texas and in parts of southern Louisiana \u2014 including Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\n\nNew Orleans hasn\u2019t recorded measurable snow \u2014 meaning at least 0.1 inch \u2014 since 2009, and has never recorded more than 3 inches of snow. The city\u2019s all-time snowiest day on record dates to 1963, when 2.7 inches fell.\n\nGusty winds could combine with heavy snow at times Tuesday and potentially create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana. If these whiteout conditions last long enough, it could prompt the region\u2019s first blizzard warning on record.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) something I never thought I\u2019d have to say in this part of the world, but blizzard conditions are certainly within reach for some areas,\u201d said Donald Jones, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\nMeasurable snow has only happened a dozen times at Houston\u2019s Hobby Airport since 1932, most recently in February 2021. The most snow to fall in a single day at the site is 4.4 inches set in February 1960.\n\nPensacola, Florida, could record its first measurable snow since 2014 with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain on the way. If measurable snow coats the ground anywhere in Florida, as it\u2019s forecast to do, it\u2019ll be the first winter since 2010 that all 50 states have had measurable snow.\n\nFreezing rain will increase travel danger. It\u2019s possible over much of northern Florida and parts of southern Georgia and South Carolina. Any amount of ice is dangerous, especially for a region so unaccustomed to it.\n\nModerate-to-major impacts are likely along the Gulf Coast as a result of this storm, according to NOAA\u2019s Winter Storm Severity Index. Travel conditions will be hazardous for many in the area and could be dangerous or even impossible in some areas \u2014 especially southeastern Texas and southern Louisiana.\n\n\u201cConsider delaying all travel,\u201d the National Weather Service in New Orleans urged Monday. \u201cUse extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, an independent organization operating the Texas power grid, issued a weather watch because the forecast weather in the state is expected to bring \u201chigher electrical demand, and the potential for lower reserves.\u201d\n\nSouth braces for rare winter blast\n\nAcross the South, authorities warned of the possibilities of dangerous travel, power outages, downed trees, and frozen pipes due to the rare winter weather.\n\nThe Houston branch of the weather service warned that freezing rain and ice could make driving treacherous until midday Wednesday, but that below-freezing overnight temperatures will remain in place until Friday.\n\nA dusting of snow covers the National Mall in the evening before the 2025 Presidential Inauguration, which will take place indoors due to inclement weather. Jasper Colt/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nHouston\u2019s mayor urged residents to protect their water pipes before the frigid temperatures hit, noting that the city\u2019s water system is already \u201cfragile\u201d with more than 1,000 active water leaks in Houston.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize the preparation of your pipes,\u201d Whitmire said Sunday. \u201cWrap your pipes if all possible.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents to stay inside, to check on vulnerable neighbors and family members, and to utilize one of the city\u2019s 24-hour warming centers. Officials are doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to encourage homeless people to seek refuge in warming centers, he added.\n\nNew Orleans officials also implored residents to be ready for the extreme cold and incoming winter weather.\n\n\u201cBe ready to stay in for three days,\u201d Colin Arnold, director of the city\u2019s Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness services, said Monday.\n\nThe city\u2019s public schools will be closed Tuesday and all city transit service will be suspended at 11 p.m. CST Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be a bit more proactive about closing the streets before people get out there and are on a skating rink,\u201d New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said Monday.\n\nIn Minnesota, where wind chills were as low as 50 below zero Monday morning, Kristi Rollwagen, Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management at the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, urged residents to wear appropriate clothing and carry an emergency survival kit during the unusually cold weather, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe dangerous cold, multiple snowstorms and California\u2019s devastating wildfires have caused an emergency shortage of platelets and some blood types at the American Red Cross. The hazardous weather canceled blood drives and prevented donors from getting to centers, amounting to more than 10,000 missed donations in the first two weeks of January.\n\nCNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar and CNN\u2019s Joe Sutton and Eric Zerkel contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMost of the United States is being assailed with extreme winter weather this week as Arctic air blasts south from Canada, snow tracks up the Northeast coast and a potentially crippling winter storm takes aim at the South.\n\nTravelers are facing delays Sunday and cold is in store for much of the nation, with more than 75% of the US expected to face freezing temperatures this week.\n\nOver 70 million people are under winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings from Tennessee to Maine on Sunday. That means snow for many Northeast cities, as a low-pressure system will bring a quick shot of snow to the I-95 corridor from Virginia to Maine on Sunday through early Monday.\n\nWashington, DC, is expected to see 1 to 3 inches of snow, with up to 6 inches expected in New York and Boston. Hartford, Connecticut, could see 5 to 7 inches of snow and Portland, Maine, could receive up to 8 inches. And in Philadelphia, where a snow emergency was declared Sunday evening, there could be 4-6 inches of snow and below freezing temperatures Sunday night.\n\nA cold weather emergency has been activated in Washington, DC, mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a Sunday post on X. The mayor warned of \u201cdangerously low\u201d temperatures overnight. The frosty forecast prompted the announcement that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration will be held indoors on Monday, the first inside presidential inauguration since Ronald Reagan in 1985.\n\nAt least 1,100 flights into or out of the US were canceled by Sunday evening with another 5,017 delayed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Over 20% of flights into or out of Newark Liberty International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled, the site shows.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency due to the storm.\n\n\u201cAs always, I urge all New Jerseyans to use caution, follow all safety protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Murphy said on X Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the South is bracing for a rare winter storm with a still-uncertain forecast. Louisiana declared a state of emergency and Texas has directed state agencies to mobilize resources due to the threat of snow.\n\nIn Houston, Texas, both civilian airports will be closed all day on Tuesday, mayor John Whitmire announced at a Sunday evening news conference. Schools in the Houston Independent School District \u2014 the largest in the state and the eighth-largest in the country \u2014 will also be closed until Wednesday, Whitmire said.\n\nThe city could see up to 5 inches of snow starting Monday night, according to National Weather Service Houston, which warned of \u201cfreezing rain\u201d and icy roads making for dangerous travel conditions into midday Wednesday. Below-freezing overnight temperatures are expected to continue from Sunday through Friday, says the agency.\n\nDangerous cold for millions\n\nArctic air spreads across much of the US this week, and for some states, the extreme cold could last for days. Nearly 150 million people are under cold weather alerts with forecasters warning of potential frozen pipes, frostbite and travel delays.\n\nMore than two dozen record lows are possible this week including in Cleveland, Kansas City, and Houston as temperatures will drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal.\n\nDenver is forecast to have a high temperature of only 9 degrees Monday, a staggering 36 degrees cooler than their normal high of 45.\n\nSouthern cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Memphis and Birmingham may not even reach a high temperature above freezing Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAn extended period of freezing temperatures could cause ruptured water pipes,\u201d the National Weather Service in Atlanta warned.\n\nHouston\u2019s mayor similarly urged residents to protect their water pipes before the frigid temperatures hit. \u201cLet me emphasize the preparation of your pipes,\u201d Whitmire said Sunday. \u201cWrap your pipes if all possible.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said that he was \u201cconvinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents to stay inside, to check on vulnerable neighbors and family members, and to utilize one of the city\u2019s 24-hour warming centers. Officials are doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to encourage homeless people to seek refuge in warming centers, he added.\n\nWind is also a huge factor in the cold. Wind speeds of 15 to 25 mph, along with the already very cold temperatures, will lead to wind chills of minus 25 to 50 below zero at times from Sunday to Tuesday across the Midwest and Northern Plains. These conditions could cause frostbite on exposed skin in less than 10 minutes.\n\n\u2018Rare, significant winter storm\u2019 for South\n\nMore than 30 million people from Texas to Georgia are under winter storm watches in preparation for a rare winter storm across the Gulf Coast and Southeast this week.\n\nThe impacts from the significant storm will begin in Texas on Monday, the Weather Prediction Center said, adding that major traffic and travel disruptions are likely through mid-week.\n\nA wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected near and south of the Interstate 20 corridor with potentially heavy snow or sleet in some areas. The sleet and freezing rain could stretch as far south as the Interstate 10 corridor.\n\nThe latest forecast shows the potential for at least 3 inches of snow in Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Macon, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama and Houston, Texas.\n\nIce accumulations could also lead to power outages and downed trees.",

They are alive and walking, wearing uniforms.\n\n\"The Red Cross has communicated that four Israeli hostages were transferred to them and are on their way toward IDF and ISA forces in the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF and Israeli Securities Authority said in a joint statement.\n\nThe IDF and ISA later said: \"A short while ago, accompanied by IDF and ISA forces, the four returning hostages crossed the border into Israeli territory. The returning hostages are currently on their way to an initial reception point in southern Israel, where they will be reunited with their parents.\"\n\nDuring their return to Israeli territory, the hostages underwent initial medical assessments.\n\n\"The commanders and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces salute and embrace the returning hostages as they make their way home to the State of Israel, the IDF wrote on X.\n\nThe four female soldiers were believed to have been, at least at one time, held all together.\n\n\"After 477 agonizing days in captivity, Daniella, Liri, Naama, and Karina are finally returning home \u2013 to their families who worked tirelessly for their release, to friends who prayed for their well-being, and to an entire nation that never lost faith this day would come,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters said in a press release.\n\n\"Their return today represents a moment of light in the darkness, a moment of hope and triumph of spirit, while serving as a painful reminder of the urgency to bring back the 90 hostages still in Gaza,\" the release continued. \"We will not stop fighting until all phases of this deal are completed and every last hostage returns home to their loved ones. We extend our deepest gratitude to President Trump, whose instrumental efforts made this deal possible.\"\n\nUnder the ceasefire deal, a total of 33 hostages are to be set free over the course of six weeks, including those already released, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\n\nHamas agreed to release three female hostages on the first day of the deal, four on the seventh day and the remaining 26 over the next five weeks.\n\nSURVIVOR OF NOVA MUSIC FESTIVAL HAMAS TERROR ATTACK WINS SLOT TO REPRESENT ISRAEL AT EUROVISION\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is the second cease-fire achieved during the war that began more than a year ago.",

General Assembly on Monday.\n\nMarianne Miller was born in Budapest, Hungary, during World War II and traveled from Israel to speak in New York City on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. During the Holocaust, Miller says she was in her mother's arms when she managed to escape a line of women marching toward a railway station, where a train was waiting to take them to Auschwitz.\n\n\"I am a survivor of the Holocaust. I can still say in first pronoun, \u2018I have been there,'\" Miller told Fox News Digital. \"Every day, Holocaust survivors are leaving us and there will be only very few left.\"\n\n\"It didn't happen in the Middle Ages.

The direction is the railway station and the destiny is Auschwitz,\" Miller said. \"I am in the arms of my mother, and then she does something that nobody before her and after her did.\"\n\nMiller recalled how her mother tore off the yellow star she was wearing and then ran out of the line, hiding under a gate and thinking that nobody saw her.\n\n\"There was a young, Hungarian Nazi, maybe 18 or 19 years old, running after her with hatred in his eyes, pointing his gun at her chest, swearing at her and telling her \u2018how did you dare to tear off the yellow star,\" Miller said, adding that the soldier threatened to kill her and make her mother rejoin the line without her.\n\nMiller told Fox News Digital that her mother then took off her golden wedding ring and offered it to the soldier.\n\nFAMILY RECIPES THAT SURVIVED HOLOCAUST NOW HELP EDUCATE OTHERS ABOUT ANTISEMITISM\n\n\"Look, this little baby. She's sleeping peacefully in my arms. She didn't do anything to you. Please let me go.

Maybe in this minute, he found a tiny bit of humanity or mercy,\" Miller added. \"My mother ran away into the darkness. And he didn't follow her.\n\n\"We were saved,\" Miller said, describing the scene as one of \"the many miracles that I am here today and can tell my story.\"\n\nLast year, Miller appeared alongside her son Adir Miller \u2014 an Israeli comedian \u2014 in \"The Ring,\" a film inspired by her story.\n\nJEWISH SOLDIER, WOUNDED IN WAR, MEMORIALIZES YOUNG HOLOCAUST HERO BY PLAYING HIS VIOLIN\n\nMiller also participated in the International March of the Living, an annual Holocaust remembrance event and educational program. The nonprofit says she \"shared her story of survival with thousands of participants joining commemorative marches through both Budapest in Hungary and Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland\" and there \"she expressed her dream of addressing world leaders at the U.N. to tell her story.\"\n\nIt helped arrange Miller\u2019s visit to U.N. headquarters, where she is expected to speak to more than 1,000 people. Israeli President Isaac Herzog will be in attendance.\n\nDanny Danon, Israel's Ambassador to the U.N., said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital that he is \"delighted\" to host Miller at the U.N. and that it is \"very important that on International Holocaust Day [that her] story will be heard and the world will see that we do not forget what happened to the Jewish people, nor do we forget who was behind those heinous crimes.\"\n\nMiller told Fox News Digital that \"the Holocaust was the most horrifying, ugliest, most terrible, most unbelievable part of the human history\" and \"God has created men to love, not to hate.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Holocaust should never, never, never again happen,\" Miller said, describing what her message will be to the U.N. \"Never again.

While the deal has helped the return of hostages held in Gaza, it comes at a heavy cost.\n\nFamilies of victims of the released prisoners have expressed anguish, grappling with the pain of reopening old wounds while recognizing the importance of reuniting hostages with their loved ones.\n\nHAMAS RELEASES 4 FEMALE HOSTAGES AS PART OF ISRAEL CEASEFIRE\n\nHillel Fuld, whose brother Ari was killed six years ago by a Palestinian terrorist, shared the personal toll of hearing the perpetrator might be freed.\n\n\"It\u2019s a punch to the gut, for sure, but I don\u2019t think our personal loss changes our opinion on this deal,\" Fuld said. \"It\u2019s both terrible and beautiful \u2014 terrible strategically, but beautiful because the hostages\u2019 families get to reunite with their loved ones.\"\n\nFuld also highlighted security concerns.\n\n\"My understanding is that the terrorist who murdered my brother will be deported outside of Israel, to Turkey or Qatar,\" Fuld said. \"I\u2019m not overly worried about that, but those returning to Judea and Samaria are definitely a security concern. I hope the government has a plan for what comes next.\"\n\nOrit Mark Ettinger lost her father, Michael Mark, in a 2016 terrorist attack. Her younger brother, Pedaya, who survived the attack that killed their father, was killed in Gaza. Two of her cousins were also victims of terror attacks.\n\n\"When I first heard about the decision to release terrorist prisoners in exchange for hostages, I felt deep pain and anguish,\" Ettinger told Fox New Digital, \"Releasing murderers who destroyed entire lives is unbearable. No one can bring my father back. Meanwhile, the terrorist who murdered him may now walk freely on the street.\n\n\"One of my father\u2019s murderers had already been released in the Shalit deal and returned to kill. We understand who we\u2019re dealing with, which is why we fear the repercussions of releasing murderers with blood on their hands. But we cannot leave the hostages \u2014 innocent people \u2014 living in hell in Gaza. They must come home.\"\n\nTwo of the prisoners released Saturday were involved in the terrorist attack that killed her father.\n\nAmong the 1,900 prisoners to be released in the ceasefire agreement are individuals responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in Israeli history. Wael Qassem is serving 35 life sentences for orchestrating suicide bombings that killed 35 people. Majdi Za'atri, sentenced to 23 life terms, drove a suicide bomber to a Jerusalem bus stop in 2003, killing 23, including children.\n\nAnother terrorist released on Saturday, according to the Israelis, was Mardawi Tabat, who \"was serving 21 life sentences for murdering 21 civilians and injuring 150 others in five suicide bombings and shooting attacks,\" according to a post on X.\n\nOther high-profile prisoners include Ammar Al-Ziben, serving 32 life sentences for planning multiple suicide bombings, including the double bombing at the Mahane Yehuda Market in 1997 that killed 16. Ahmad Salah, serving 21 life sentences, was involved in two Jerusalem suicide bus bombings in 2004 that killed 19 people and injured over 100.\n\nIsraeli General Security Service Director Ronen Bar warned that 82% of the 1,024 prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit exchange returned to terrorism.\n\n\"Many of the leaders of Hamas who orchestrated the Oct. 7 massacre were among those released in previous deals,\" Bar told the security cabinet, while still recommending going ahead with the deal.\n\nBITTERSWEET REJOICING AS FIRST HOSTAGES RETURN TO ISRAEL AFTER 471 DAYS IN CAPTIVITY\n\nZohar Dvir, former commander of the elite Yamam counterterrorism unit, told Fox News Digital, \"Arresting such a terrorist requires immense investment in intelligence, planning, creativity and a high level of risk for our forces, who often pay a heavy price. However, when it comes to the lives of many hostages, we are compelled to pay a heavy price by releasing terrorists.\n\n\"The chances of rescuing them alive diminish dramatically from one operation to the next, as time passes. The way to release hostages alive is through a deal. Talking from experience, the security establishment has a long memory and will settle accounts with everyone sooner or later, wherever they may be.\"\n\nIsraeli journalist Yair Cherki, whose brother was killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem, weighed in on the deal\u2019s implications.\n\n\"Israel succumbed to humanitarian pressure at the most critical moment, providing aid that effectively reinforced Hamas\u2019s civilian control in Gaza,\" Cherki said. \"Diplomatically, the strategy relied entirely on waiting for Trump, which proved to be a dead end. Like Biden\u2019s \"don\u2019t,\" Trump\u2019s gates of hell also worked both ways, leaving Israel without any diplomatic leverage.\n\n\"After 15 months, the time for the hostages has run out, and Israel is left with no choice but to accept the deal to bring the hostages home and begin healing a fractured society. Releasing these terrorists is not just a problem for the victims\u2019 families, but for all Israeli society and future victims.\n\n\"This cycle of deals leading to murder and kidnapping must end. Releasing the hostages reflects our society\u2019s commitment to life and mutual responsibility. This is our DNA.\"\n\nEven those directly affected, like Fuld and Ettinger, acknowledge the hostages must be prioritized.\n\n\"Most families support the deal because they would do anything to bring their loved ones back,\" Ettinger noted. \"But we fear these released terrorists will harm others.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCherki underscored the collective responsibility of Israeli society.\n\n\"This deal is not just about individual families,\" Cherki said. \"It\u2019s about a society\u2019s commitment to life and solidarity. Despite its flaws, this deal may serve as a key to healing a broken nation.\"",

                "text": "President Donald Trump is calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to \"make a deal\" to end the \"ridiculous\" war with Ukraine, which started nearly three years ago. During his 2024 campaign, Trump often spoke about ending major world conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war, invoking former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s \"peace through strength\" doctrine. Now that he\u2019s in office, Trump is making it clear that it\u2019s time for Putin to come to the table.\n\n\"I\u2019m not looking to hurt Russia,\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. In the post, Trump threatens \"high levels of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States.\" This threat comes days after reports that Putin was starting to get concerned about his country\u2019s economy as the war with Ukraine continues.\n\nTRUMP CALLS ON PUTIN TO MAKE A DEAL, END ITS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE OR FACE MORE ECONOMIC PRESSURE\n\nOleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner, believes now is the time for Trump to show strength and bring an end to the war.\n\n\"Russia\u2019s relentless invasion demands lasting international security guarantees. Any peace deal must confront Russia\u2019s hostility to safeguard Ukraine and the very foundations of freedom and democracy,\" Matviichuk said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital, Matviichuk emphasized the need to not only end the war that began in February 2022, but also to block Putin from achieving his \"geopolitical goal,\" as she believes the Russian leader has no interest in peace.\n\n\"When we design this peace process, we have to design security guarantees, which will make this [geopolitical] goal for Putin impossible to achieve,\" Matviichuk said.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already told him he\u2019s ready to negotiate an end to the war.\n\nUKRAINE: HOW THE WAR SHIFTED IN 2024\n\nIn his first sit-down interview since returning to the White House, Trump told \"Hannity\" that Zelenskyy has \"had enough.\" However, while Trump condemned Putin, he said that Zelenskyy is \"no angel,\" chastising the Ukrainian leader for fighting instead of making a deal.\n\nReuters reported in November that Putin is open to discussing a peace plan. He reportedly could agree to freeze the conflict along the current lines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSince Putin's 2022 invasion, civilians in Ukraine have had to adjust to life during war. Matviichuk, who is based out of Kyiv, describes it as living in \"total uncertainty.\" However, her focus has been on exposing Russia's atrocities. Nearly three years into the war, she has cataloged approximately 80,000 Russian crimes.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want to live in Putin\u2019s world,\" Matviichuk said. \"We want to live in a world where democracy and rule of law and freedom are respected.\"\n\nAshley Carnahan and Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.",

                "text": "A film shows a large group of children walking out of Auschwitz concentration camp in the company of nuns. Regina Horowitz recognized her own child and begged the camera operator to give her the frames of the film depicting Ryszard.\n\nThere are very few survivors left as the world commemorates the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz. The Horowitz family's tale of survival is one such documentation.\n\nThe Krak\u00f3w orphanage would send her Regina Horowitz to another address, where she miraculously found her five-year-old son, who was just as shocked to see his mom alive. And not just her, but also his sister Niusia and his grandmother . . . all three women saved by German industrialist Oskar Schindler.\n\nHOLOCAUST SURVIVORS CAN LIVE ON FOR GENERATIONS WITH CREATIVE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nRenowned photographer Ryszard Horowitz was born on May 5th, 1939, to a loving family in the historic city of Krak\u00f3w, the former capital of Poland, but just four months later Nazi Germany invaded Poland, resulting in utter devastation.\n\nThe war would turn brutal and sinister, especially for Poland's Jews.\n\n\"When the Germans marched into Krak\u00f3w,\" Horowitz told Fox News Digital, \"my parents' first reaction was to run away. They packed their suitcases and left me with my non-Jewish nanny, Antosia. But soon they returned with my sister, because they did not want me to stay behind. So, we were reunited but eventually forced to relocate to the ghetto.\"\n\nThe Nazis segregated Jews from the rest of the population, forcing them into Krakow\u2019s notorious ghetto. Life was bleak behind the fences, in constant fear of Nazi persecution.\n\nFortunately for Ryszard, there was an older boy there, called Roman Liebling, known later as Roman Polanski, who attended his third birthday party. According to Polanski, although food was scarce, by some miracle Ryszard\u2019s mother, Regina, managed to procure hot chocolate for the kids. Ryszard, however, did not care for hot chocolate and refused to drink it.\n\nTENNESSEE PROFESSOR REVEALS STORY OF HER LATE HUSBAND, A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR, AMID TODAY'S ANTISEMITISM\n\nBy 1943, the Germans were liquidating Krak\u00f3w\u2019s ghetto, and the Horowitz family was forced to relocate to a Nazi concentration camp in Plaszow. It was run by a notorious Nazi commander, Austrian officer Amon G\u00f6th.\n\n\"It was a terrible camp, because the man in charge was an extremely brutal character. He created a tremendous sense of fear. He was shooting people right and left. He was like a God in terms of his power and made life there totally impossible,\" Horowitz recalled.\n\nG\u00f6th liked to throw parties in his villa, where two of Ryszard\u2019s musician uncles were forced to play.\n\nOne of the men attending the parties was German industrialist Oskar Schindler. His friendship with G\u00f6th enabled him to run a business that would ultimately become a lifeline for many of the camps Jews.\n\n\"Oscar Schindler got permission to open a factory producing utensils for the German army, and my family worked there.\" Horowitz explained.\n\nSteven Spielberg introduced Oskar Schindler to the entire world in his 1993 movie \"Schindler's List,\" and Horowitz shared some observations about the famed businessman.\n\n\"Everybody will tell you something else about him. How good he was, how bad he was, how handsome he was, how many women he had, but the bottom line is . . . somehow, he felt this urge to save people. Once, he got into trouble when he kissed my sister when she gave him a cake for his birthday,\" Horowitz said.\n\nIn 1944, the Germans decided it was time to dismantle Plaszow, disguise the traces of their atrocities, and close Schindler\u2019s factory.\n\n'LIVING LEGEND': SCHUMER HONORS CENTENARIAN HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR WITH CAPITOL FLAG, SENATE FLOOR RECOGNITION\n\n\"Schindler managed to get permission to move a certain number of workers to his factory in Br\u00fcnnlitz, in Czechoslovakia,\" Horowitz said.\n\nBr\u00fcnnlitz was a German labor camp, and as Spielberg showed in his film, a list was created with names of those who would be relocated there.\n\n\"There is no question that there was a list, and my family was on that list. I was not, because I was too small to work, but somehow, I managed to squeeze in. There were two transports, one of men and one of women. I was traveling with my father,\" Horowitz explained.\n\nSchindler\u2019s men made it to Br\u00fcnnlitz alive, but Ryszard\u2019s life was about to unravel.\n\n\"We waited for the women to follow us to Br\u00fcnnlitz. But, for some reason, we do not know why, they were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp instead,\" he said.\n\nSchindler hurried to Auschwitz to rescue his women and left Josef Leipold in charge of his factory.\n\n\"Leipold was the exact opposite of Schindler.\" Horowitz said. \"From the beginning, his idea was to finish us off. And he did not want children there. So, he packed us with our fathers and shipped us to Auschwitz.\"\n\nUpon arriving at Auschwitz, Ryszard was selected to have concentration camp numbers tattooed on his forearm. Which meant he would stay alive, for a time.\n\nYOUNGEST PERSON SAVED BY OSKAR SCHINDLER: 'I FEEL GUILTY THAT I SURVIVED'\n\nOskar Schindler managed to rescue the women. They were aboard a train that was about to depart for Auschwitz.\n\nHorowitz recalled these heartbreaking moments, \"My cousin and I saw the train, and my mother was there, my sister, my grandmother . . . and they saw us. My mother was certain this was the last time she would see me. They went to Br\u00fcnnlitz, and my father and I remained in Auschwitz.\"\n\nIn January 1945, with the Red Army approaching, German SS forces marched thousands of prisoners out of Auschwitz to different camps on German territory. Richard\u2019s father, Dawid \"Dolek\" Horowitz, was forced to leave his son behind.\n\n\"I think that one of the reasons I survived was that a man in charge of a warehouse, Roman Gunz, agreed to look after me. Sometimes he would feed me, and when things got difficult, he would hide me in the warehouse or inside the infectious hospital ward,\" Horowitz said.\n\nThen one day, the nightmare of Auschwitz came to an end.\n\n\"When the Red Army came close to the camp, the Germans were in a panic. They rounded all the kids up and were ready to shoot us, but just then two German officers arrived on motorcycles screaming to drop everything and follow them, so they did,\" Horowitz remembered.\n\nA few hours later, Soviet troops entered Auschwitz.\n\n\"The Red Army arrived, most of them on horseback,\" he said. \"They gave us food and sweets. They had cameras with them, and they recorded a lot of footage. The following day, nuns arrived and took us to an orphanage in Krak\u00f3w. Polanski\u2019s aunt Tosia found me there and took me to her apartment on Dluga Street. And Roman was already there.\"\n\nIn March 1945, Br\u00fcnnlitz was liberated, and the Horowitz women returned to Krak\u00f3w.\n\n\"One day, my mom was out in the market Square, where they were showing a documentary movie about the liberation of Auschwitz, and she recognized me in it,\" Horowitz said.\n\nThe Horowitz women moved in with Roman Polanski\u2019s family. They were soon joined by Dawid Horowitz.\n\n\"We all lived under one roof for two years, until my father got us a nice apartment near Market Square,\" Horowitz said.\n\nAfter the war, Poles found their country in ruins with a hostile communist regime in charge.\n\n\"Most of my closest friends and their families were anti-communists. Everybody\u2019s dream was to get out of Poland as fast as possible,\" Horowitz explained.\n\nDawid Horowitz managed to open a store selling tools and building materials, with Polanski\u2019s aunt Tosia as his business partner. Life went on.\n\n\"For me and my friends, life was pretty good at the time, because we were not engaged in politics. We were artists, and we believed that we lived in a totally free society, so we did what we wanted to do, and we had this amazing outlet, a cabaret called \"Piwnica pod Barnami\" (The Cellar under the Rams). And we had jazz,\" Horowitz recalled.\n\nIn 1958, American jazz pianist Dave Brubeck arrived in Krak\u00f3w to perform. Ryszard Horowitz was there with his camera and documented it in pictures. Little did he know that photography was his future. And that future was on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"I had this opportunity because my uncles here in New York were ready to offer me room and board. And I also received a scholarship from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn,\" Horowitz said.\n\nWith his father\u2019s encouragement and some U.S. dollars hidden in the heel of his shoe, Horowitz boarded the Polish ocean liner \"MS Batory.\"\n\nLife as an immigrant in the Big Apple was a mixed bag. But at the Pratt Institute, Horowitz quickly exhibited a unique talent for photography.\n\n\"I created their first photography lab at Pratt, and I was asked to design their 75th anniversary yearbook, which I edited, and I pretty much took all the photographs for them. It was the first time in history that the New York Art Directors Club gave an award to a student. So, this became my portfolio,\" Horowitz explained.\n\nRyszard connected with influential people who helped pave his way to success. Among them were photographer Richard Avedon, graphic artist Saul Steinberg and ballet choreographer Sergei Diaghilev, as well as his idol, disc jockey Willis Conover, who hosted the Jazz Hour on the Voice of America.\n\nThrough the lens of his camera, Horowitz saw the world somewhat differently. His photographs looked like computer-generated graphics, except that they predated the digital age. He became known as the pioneer of special effects photography.\n\nFULL-SCALE REPLICA OF ANNE FRANK'S HIDDEN ANNEX TO BE UNVEILED IN NEW YORK CITY\n\n\"I found a way of reversing perspective and juxtaposing large objects to make them look small and vice versa,\" Horowitz said.\n\nHorowitz was a master of light. He learned to manipulate light to photograph expensive jewelry and new cars.\n\n\"My art education in Krak\u00f3w helped me \u2013 my devotion to the great masters of painting,\" Horowitz explained.\n\nHis iconic commercial work captivated audiences in the world of advertising, bringing him fame and prestigious awards. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw in Poland, and in 2014, his hometown of Krak\u00f3w made him an honorary citizen.\n\n\"Some of my photographs consist of different images taken in different parts of the world, and they are merged into a single unit that\u2019s not jarring but believable. They appear as though they are an instance of a situation that never existed except in my head. That\u2019s why I call myself a \u2018photocomposer,\" Horowitz explained.\n\nHe achieved success in his personal life as well. Since 1974, he\u2019s been happily married to Anna Bogusz, and they have two grown sons: Daniel and Emil.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I met Ania at a party. She was an architecture student from a Polish family living in Caracas, Venezuela. She was only passing through New York on her way to Paris to continue her studies. She never made it to Paris,\" Horowitz smiled, recollecting meeting the love of his life.\n\nSo many years after he walked out of Auschwitz alive, Ryszard Horowitz feels blessed to live the American Dream with his family, and doing what he loves most \u2013 creating his photo compositions . . . and listening to jazz.",

He has relied on subsidies and political support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself in office for a quarter-century, a relationship that helped him survive the 2020 protests.\n\nLukashenko allowed Moscow to use the country\u2019s territory to invade Ukraine in 2022 and later hosted some of Russia\u2019s tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin called Lukashenko on Monday to congratulate him on his \"convincing victory.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping also sent congratulations.\n\nSome observers believe Lukashenko feared a repeat of those mass demonstrations amid economic troubles and the fighting in Ukraine, and so scheduled the vote in January, when few would want to fill the streets again, rather than hold it in August.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLeading opponents have fled abroad or were thrown in prison. Activists say the country holds nearly 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center.\n\nSince July, Lukashenko has pardoned more than 250 people. At the same time, authorities have sought to uproot dissent by arresting hundreds more in raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners.\n\nOpposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after challenging Lukashenko in 2020, denounced the election as a \"senseless farce\" and urged voters to cross off everyone listed on the ballot.",

                "text": "The Rwanda-backed rebel group M23 is battling Congolese government forces in Congo's key city of Goma, causing the international airport there to be evacuated.\n\nM23 is one of about 100 armed groups fighting for control in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called on M23 to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw its forces, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said.\n\nThe international airport in Goma was evacuated and commercial flights temporarily grounded on Sunday as fighting between Rwanda-backed rebels and government forces raged around eastern Congo's key city, leaving at least 13 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers dead and displacing thousands of civilians.\n\nThe M23 rebel group has made significant territorial gains along the border with Rwanda in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, the provincial capital that has a population of around 2 million and is a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts.\n\nGoma\u2019s international airport, which is east of the city, was evacuated by the military and commercial flights were temporarily grounded due to the fighting, an airport agent told The Associated Press. The agent spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak on the matter publicly.\n\nISRAEL TELLS UN IT'S SHUTTING DOWN ALL UNRWA OPERATIONS IN JERUSALEM: 'ACUTE SECURITY RISKS'\n\nThe United Nations on Sunday told its staff not to go to the airport and to shelter in place, according to an internal email seen by AP.\n\nCongo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.\n\nRwanda\u2019s government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.\n\nThe Congolese Foreign Ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling out all diplomatic staff from the country \"with immediate effect.\"\n\nRwanda\u2019s Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told AP on Sunday that the decision to cut ties was a unilateral move by Congo \"that was even published on social media before being sent to our embassy.\"\n\n\"For us, we took appropriate measures to evacuate our remaining diplomat in Kinshasa, who was under permanent threat by Congolese officials. And this was achieved on Friday, one day before the publication of this so-called note verbale on social media,\" he said.\n\nIn the last 48 hours, two U.N. peacekeepers from South Africa and one from Uruguay were killed, and 11 peacekeepers were injured and hospitalized, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 spokesman said Sunday ahead of an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe U.N. chief reiterated his \"strongest condemnation\" of the M23 offensive \"with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces,\" and called on the rebel group to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw its forces, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said.\n\nOn Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, just a few miles from the front line. Scores of displaced children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo, right near the Rwandan border, and headed south to Goma.\n\n\"We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,\" said Safi Shangwe, who was heading to Goma.\n\n\"We are tired and we are afraid, our children are at risk of starving,\" she added.\n\nSome of the displaced worried they will not be safe in Goma either.\n\n\"We are going to Goma, but I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don\u2019t know where to go,\" said Ad\u00e8le Shimiye.\n\nHundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda through the \"Great Barrier\" border crossing east of Goma on Sunday. Migration officers carefully checked travel documents.\n\n\"I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,\" Muahadi Amani, a resident of Goma, told the AP.\n\nEarlier in the week, the rebels seized Sake, 16 miles from Goma, as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCongo\u2019s army said Saturday it fended off an M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. troops and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC.\n\nIn addition to the two South African peacekeepers, seven South African troops with SAMIDIRC have been killed in recent days, South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Defense said.\n\nSince 2021, Congo\u2019s government and allied forces, including SAMIDRC and U.N. troops, have been keeping M23 away from Goma. The U.N. peacekeeping force entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.",

                "text": "The pristine German college town of T\u00fcbingen flourishes today, in stark contrast to its dark past.\n\nThe southwestern city of 90,000 was once home to Theodor Dannecker, a Nazi captain and one of the closest aides to Adolf Eichmann, known as the \"architect of the Holocaust.\" In 1933, the University of T\u00fcbingen, where many of the infamous Nazi soldiers known as SS trained until 1945, proudly billed itself as \"Jew free.\" These days, T\u00fcbingen is acknowledging its painful history in order to rise above it.\n\n\"We can only live here as Christians in this congregation if we take responsibility for the history of this city,\" Jobst Bittner, founder of both T\u00fcbingen\u2019s TOS Church and the March of Life initiative, where descendants of Nazis organize marches against antisemitism with Christians and Jews throughout the world, told Israel\u2019s Channel 11.\n\nThe television outlet's report showed a banner across the windows of the TOS church that read \"Bring Them Home Now,\" a call to release nearly 100 Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023. Inside the church is a store with merchandise and books about Israel. Downstairs is the \"Museum of Guilt,\" which displays pictures of Nazis from T\u00fcbingen, with photographs of mass graves that were once hidden in cigar boxes as souvenirs of the Holocaust.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS DIGITAL'S COVERAGE OF \u2018ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED\u2019\n\nAnother segment in the report showed young people from the church singing \"Am Yisrael Chai\" (\"The People of Israel Live\") even though they barely know Hebrew. During the holiday of Sukkot, they build sukkahs (temporary huts) to celebrate the Israelites\u2019 freedom from enslavement in Egypt.\n\nHeinz Reuss, an elder at TOS Church and international director of the March of Life, described last year\u2019s Sukkot celebrated in the Market Square in the center of town as \"very beautiful.\" He said that the rabbi from the next town came to T\u00fcbingen to recite blessings, just like he does during Hanukkah when they light the menorah candles.\n\nThe musical, \"A Ship Makes History,\" based on the story of a Holocaust survivor and Exodus, has also been performed during Hanukkah. Michaela Buckel, program director of the March of Life movement and author of the play, described how it teaches children about the Holocaust in a non-threatening way and that she was inspired by the resiliency of the Jewish people after the Holocaust.\n\n\"I wanted to focus the play on this willingness to live and to fight for new life, even though it's hard,\" she said.\n\nReuss said the Christians at his church celebrate some of the Jewish holidays as a gesture of friendship and to acknowledge \"that\u2019s where the blessing comes from, the Jewish roots.\"\n\nAddressing the town\u2019s antisemitic history, Reuss remembered a turning point in 2003, when a lot of congregants started to discover that their own family members had been Nazis.\n\n\"It was a powerful time of repentance and also of healing in some way,\" he said.\n\nTOS worship leader Kim-Sophie Kasch, 24, told Fox News Digital that when she was 7 years old, after her great-grandfather died, her family discovered that he was a Nazi. He had been part of the Wehrmacht armed forces of Nazi Germany and had been in European areas \"where they committed crimes against the Polish-Lithuanian population (and) also the Jews who lived there.\"\n\nKasch described her father as being \"really shocked when he heard about his grandpa.\"\n\nReuss said that when TOS church congregants found out there were eight concentration camps located around T\u00fcbingen, as well as the grim trails of death marches, \"everything became visible. Everyone saw it.\"\n\nHe described how they organized a prayer march with descendants of Holocaust survivors and descendants of Nazis, which became a three-day event.\n\n\"It was very, very meaningful for us,\" said Reuss.\n\nSince 2007, March of Life events have been held in hundreds of cities in more than 20 countries, where Holocaust survivors and descendants of Nazis visit concentration camp sites and mass graves across Europe.\n\nIn 2009, the movement expanded to the United States, where it became known as the March of Remembrance, a memorial walk every spring on Yom HaShoah, Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day.\n\n\"The message is remembrance, reconciliation and making a stand for Israel and against antisemitism,\" Reuss said. \"It teaches the lessons of the Holocaust, and we encourage people to really face the history of antisemitism in their own families.\"\n\nReuss said his great-grandfather from the Netherlands, who was an Orthodox reform Christian, saved Jewish lives by refusing to sign a declaration stating that he was not Jewish because he didn\u2019t want to betray his Jewish friends. He expressed disappointment that his German grandfather on his father\u2019s side did not display the same courage and withdrew from Jewish people.\n\n\"It's so important to really speak out and not be silent in your personal surroundings and your workspace, because this is antisemitism. It\u2019s evil. It's something that doesn't stop with the Jews,\" Reuss said.\n\nReuss told Fox News Digital how this year, for Holocaust Remembrance Day on Jan. 27, survivor Irene Shashar, who was born on Dec. 12, 1937, as Ruth Lewkowicz, will be honored at the TOS church. She will speak the day before, telling congregants her story of survival in Warsaw.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Nazis invaded Shashar\u2019s homeland of Poland when she was 2 years old, and her father was murdered when she was 5. Shashar credits her mother\u2019s ingenuity for helping her to survive by hiding her in closets and sewers with her beloved doll, Laleczka. Referring to her two children and seven grandchildren at a U.N. speech in 2020, she declared, \"I survived \u2026 Hitler didn\u2019t win and I have proof.\"",

                "text": "South Korean prosecutors have indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of leading a rebellion after he briefly imposed martial law last month, according to the country\u2019s opposition party, as well as several South Korean media reports.\n\nYoon, a conservative, has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face life in prison or the death penalty.\n\n\"The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection,\" Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo said at a press conference, according to Reuters. \"The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally.\"\n\nThe move announced Sunday makes Yoon the first sitting South Korean president to face an indictment and criminal investigation, according to the Washington Post.\n\nYoon became the second conservative president to be impeached in South Korea when the opposition-led parliament voted to suspend his duties on Dec. 14.\n\nIMPEACHED SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT DETAINED WEEKS AFTER MARTIAL LAW CHAOS\n\nHe was arrested earlier this month over his Dec. 3, 2024, martial law decree that plunged Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. ally into political turmoil. Yoon has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, calling his martial law a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly, which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials.\n\nIn declaring martial law, Yoon called the assembly \"a den of criminals\" and vowed to eliminate \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\"\n\nHe sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon\u2019s decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it.\n\nThough Yoon rescinded the decree after just six hours, the martial law imposition was the first of its kind in South Korea in more than 40 years and evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in the 1960s-80s.\n\nYoon had resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him. After a days-long standoff between his security detail and authorities, Yoon was then apprehended on Jan. 15 in a massive law enforcement operation at his presidential compound, becoming the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested. Yoon, a former prosecutor himself, has been held in solitary confinement since then, according to Reuters.\n\nSOUTH KOREA\u2019S IMPEACHED PRESIDENT AVOIDS ARREST ATTEMPT AFTER HOURSLONG STANDOFF\n\nAfter a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon\u2019s detainment, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property, according to the Associated Press. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said they detained 46 protesters.\n\n\n\nSeparate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.\n\nLeading Yoon\u2019s investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but since his detainment Yoon has refused to attend CIO\u2019s questioning, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said it can investigate Yoon\u2019s rebellion allegation as it\u2019s related to his abuse of power and other allegations.\n\nThe CIO handed over Yoon\u2019s case to the Seoul prosecutors\u2019 office Friday and asked it to indict him on rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Yoon\u2019s defense team urged prosecutors to immediately release Yoon and launch an investigation into the CIO.\n\n\n\nSouth Korean media outlets, including Yonhap news agency, reported on Sunday that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office indicted Yoon on rebellion charges.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the martial law decree.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Argentinian President Javier Milei rallied against \"the mental virus of woke ideology\" during a fiery speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n\nMilei credited the fundamental values of Western civilization, like respect for life and liberty, free speech and freedom of religion, for enabling the Industrial Revolution that lifted \"90% of the global population out of poverty.\" He then slammed wokeism as the disease that will destroy everything dear to the West.\n\n\"This is the great epidemic of our time that must be cured. This is the cancer we need to get rid of. This ideology has colonized the world's most important institutions \u2013 from the political parties and governments of leading Western nations to global governance organizations, even NGOs, universities and media outlets,\" said Milei, adding, \"Western civilization \u2013 and even the human species \u2013 will not be able to return to the path of progress demanded by our pioneering spirit. It is essential to break these ideological chains if we want to usher in a new golden age.\"\n\nGLOBALIZATION IS OVER AND WE\u2019RE TAKING DAVOS DOWN WITH IT, SAYS WATTERS\n\nMilei did not hold back talking about gender ideology and criticized the left for their radically liberal policies.\n\nHe castigated those leaders who are \"attempting to impose the idea that women are men and men are women simply based on self-perception. And they say nothing about when a man dresses as a woman and kills his opponent in a boxing ring, or when a male prison inmate claims to be a woman and ends up sexually assaulting women in prison.\"\n\nMilei used an example of a same-sex couple in Georgia who were jailed last month for abusing and pimping their adopted boys to a pedophile ring, according to a report by the New York Post.\n\nThe Argentine leader said, \"I want to be clear when I say abuse. This is no euphemism, because in its most extreme forms, gender ideology is outright child abuse. They are pedophiles,\" Milei declared.\n\nKLAUS SCHWAB'S WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS EXPOSED AS PLACE WHERE 'CRONYISM CAN FLOURISH'\n\nCalling Elon Musk a dear friend, Milei put up a furious defense of children against the dangers of transgenderism.\n\n\"Healthy children are being irreversibly harmed through hormone treatments and mutilation, as if a 5-year-old child could possibly consent to such things, and should their family not agree to this, there will always be state agents ready to step in in favour of what they call the best interests of the child.\"\n\nMusk\u2019s biological son transitioned into a girl a few years ago, which led the billionaire to remark that his child was figuratively \"killed\" by the \"woke mind virus.\"\n\nMilei added, \"Only now are we beginning to see the effects of an entire generation that has mutilated their bodies, encouraged by a culture of sexual relativism, and these people will have to spend their entire lives in psychiatric treatment to cope with what they have done to themselves. Yet no one dares to speak about these issues. Not only that, but the vast majority have also been subjected to the misguided self-perceptions of a tiny minority.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe libertarian Milei became president in 2023, and the chaotic economy of Argentina has stabilized under his leadership, according to The Associated Press. He was optimistic about his country's future, calling it a \"new Argentina,\" but not so much about the state of the world unless wokeism is reversed.\n\n\"Believe me, the scandalous experiments in the name of this criminal ideology will be condemned and likened to those committed in the darkest periods in our history.\"\n\nMilei ended with his often said slogan, \"Thank you all very much and long live freedom, damn it.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, has formally notified U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of Israel\u2019s demand for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to cease its operations in Jerusalem and evacuate its premises by January 30, 2025.\n\nThe directive follows recent legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset, terminating Israel\u2019s agreements with UNRWA and citing national security concerns.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Guterres, Danon outlined the rationale behind the decision, emphasizing \"the acute national security risks posed by the widespread infiltration of UNRWA\u2019s ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\" He also accused the agency of failing to address Israel\u2019s long-standing concerns and of compromising its \"fundamental obligation to impartiality and neutrality beyond repair.\"\n\nSTEFANIK PLANS TO PUSH TRUMP'S 'AMERICA FIRST' AGENDA AT UN, MAKE SURE IT 'SERVES THE INTERESTS' OF US PEOPLE\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also been a vocal critic of UNRWA, withholding funding for it during his first term as president. The United States had previously been UNRWA\u2019s largest donor, contributing more than $350 million annually. In March, Congress agreed to cut funding to the controversial agency for a year.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary-General told Fox News Digital, \"The Secretary-General has been clear in the need to maintain support for UNRWA, which is the backbone of U.N. operations in the occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nDanon's letter stated that \"months of good-faith engagement\" with the United Nations had failed to produce results, accusing UNRWA of abusing its immunity to bypass local laws and regulations. He underscored Israel\u2019s legal position, asserting that \"no state is required to assist and cooperate with an entity that undermines its national security.\"\n\nAnne Bayefsky, Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital said Israel's move is a long time coming. \"UNRWA is a cash cow for the United Nations, and also for Palestinian so-called refugees who\u2014in marked contrast to refugees everywhere else in the world\u2014supposedly inherit their refugee status as long as the Jews are still there. UNRWA schools have taught generations of Palestinians to hate the Jews next door and to spend their lives seeking to terminate Israel instead of cohabiting in peace.\"\n\nNEW REPORTS CLAIM UNRWA WORKS WITH TERRORISTS, TEACHES HATE AS AGENCY HITS BACK AT CRITICS\n\nThe legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset includes two complementary bills that sever all ties between Israel and UNRWA, including the termination of diplomatic visas and services provided to the agency. The bills received overwhelming support from both coalition and opposition members of the Knesset.\n\nCritics of the legislation, including the Biden administration, have warned that it could create a humanitarian crisis for the millions of Palestinians who rely on UNRWA for education, healthcare, and basic services.\n\nDuring a U.N. press briefing on Friday, a spokesperson responded to questions regarding the situation, stating, \"We are in touch, but we have continued to emphasize the indispensability of UNRWA.\" When asked about contingency plans should the Israeli legislation be implemented, the spokesperson said, \"We will see what the future brings. Obviously, we are doing our utmost and UNRWA will do its utmost to continue to provide aid to the people under our mandate, as much as we can.\"\n\nBefore the Israeli letter was made public, an UNRWA spokeswoman had previously told Fox News Digital they didn't have a plan in place for ongoing operations once the ban starts.\n\nThe spokesperson claimed that, \"UNRWA has the most robust systems in place in comparison to other United Nations agencies when it comes to the adherence to the principle of neutrality with regards to our programs that we do and our staff.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn August, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini confirmed the probable involvement of UNRWA employees in the Oct.7 massacre. He later confirmed that at least nine UNRWA staffers were fired after an internal probe.\n\nDanon called on the United Nations to \"put an end to the unprecedented infiltration and abuse of a U.N. organ by terrorist organizations\" to restore the U.N.\u2019s credibility.",

In the past week, at least 80 people have been killed and an estimated 36,000 more displaced as fighting intensifies between the National Liberation Army, or ELN, and holdouts from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.\n\nPetro's conservative opponents have criticized the move, accusing the former guerrilla of riding roughshod over the constitution. But some activists have celebrated it, saying they are hopeful the move translates into better infrastructure, health care and schools in the traditionally lawless region.\n\n\"Why are the armed groups here? Because the last government hasn't made investments. They've abandoned us,\" Jaime Botero, an activist in the town of Tibu, told The Associated Press.\n\nEarlier this week Petro reactivated arrest orders against 31 top ELN commanders that had been suspended as part of an effort to woo the the Cuban revolution-inspired insurgency into a peace deal to end its 60 year war against the state. Petro also suspended all peace talks, which have advanced slowly since he took office in 2022.\n\nThe ELN has traditionally dominated in Catatumbo but has been losing ground to holdouts from the FARC, a guerrilla group that largely disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with the government.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe current conflict is spilling across the border into Venezuela, where some of those fleeing the violence have sought refuge.\n\nThe current whereabouts of the ELN peace negotiators is unknown.

                "text": "The premier of a key oil region in Canada is open to talking with President Donald Trump about reopening the Keystone Pipeline, which, according to experts, could strengthen energy security and affordability.\n\nDanielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, Canada, said on Tuesday that she was interested in talking to the Trump administration about potentially reopening the Keystone XL oil pipeline \u2013 a system that was designed to carry oil from Alberta to the U.S. through to states like Illinois, Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nThe pipeline has been at the forefront of political debate since the project began construction in 2010, and was eventually halted by former President Barack Obama before it was finished. Trump revived it during his first term, but in 2021, former President Joe Biden again blocked the project.\n\nTrump could resume construction during his second term, and do so with the help of Smith, who said that she wants to have conversations about potential cross-border pipelines, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nALASKA LEADERS CHEER TRUMP OIL AND GAS DRILLING EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n\"What I would propose is\u2014are there ways that we can look at increasing pipeline access, perhaps some new routes or perhaps some new proposals on existing routes?\" Smith told the outlet. \"So, whether it's a Keystone 2.0 or something else, I'm looking forward to starting those conversations in earnest once the interior secretary is sworn in.\" Trump tapped Gov. Doug Burgum, R-N.D., to lead the U.S. Department of the Interior, but he has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTRUMP TELLS EU TO BUY MORE AMERICAN-MADE OIL AND GAS OR FACE \u2018TARIFFS ALL THE WAY\u2019\n\nThe White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, this week, Trump rescinded Biden's executive order that canceled the pipeline's permits, a move that could reopen potential construction of the oil system.\n\n\"Restarting the Keystone XL pipeline aligns with President Trump\u2019s agenda to lower food and energy costs by bolstering North American energy infrastructure and reducing reliance on costly imports,\" Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute (AEI), told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The pipeline\u2019s ability to transport heavy sour crude, rich in sulfur, will support the production of affordable fertilizers, a critical input for agriculture, ultimately lowering food-production costs,\" Isaac said. \"Additionally, the increased supply of crude oil will stabilize fuel prices, reducing transportation and energy costs that significantly impact food prices. This project strengthens energy security, fosters economic growth, and directly contributes to making energy and food more affordable for American families.\"\n\nAnother expert said that Trump will likely face litigation if he chooses to proceed with construction of the pipeline, but that Congress could help limit legal action.\n\n\"The Trump administration will, no doubt, provide the needed permits for completing the Keystone XL, but litigation is sure to occur,\" Steve Milloy, a senior fellow at the Energy & Environmental Legal Institute and former Trump EPA transition team member, told Fox News Digital. \"The trick will be to limit the litigation so that investors don\u2019t get scared off. Congress could aid the process by ordering the pipeline completed and limiting the litigation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn December 2022, the Biden administration's Department of Energy (DOE) published a report that said the Keystone XL project would have created between 16,149 and 59,000 jobs and would have had a positive economic impact of between $3.4 and 9.6 billion, citing various studies.",

Iran's top diplomat suggested instead that Israelis be sent to Greenland.\n\nImage: Sky News' international affairs editor Dominic Waghorn with Mr Araghchi\n\nMr Araghchi invited Sky News to Iran's foreign ministry for the interview, taking the opportunity to address talk of Israel attacking Iran's alleged nuclear weapons programme with US backing.\n\n\"We have made it clear,\" he said, \"that any attack to our nuclear facilities would be faced with an immediate and decisive response. But I don't think they will do that crazy thing. This is really crazy. And this would turn the whole region into a very bad disaster.\"\n\nImage: Donald Trump. Pic: Reuters\n\nIn his first term in office, Mr Trump reneged on America's support for an internationally negotiated deal over Iran's alleged nuclear weapons programme, which saw uranium enrichment limited in return for sanctions being lifted.\n\nIran insists its nuclear programme is for civilian and peaceful purposes. However, since Mr Trump went back on the deal, Iran has returned to enriching uranium to levels that have no purpose other than building a nuclear weapon, say Western governments.\n\nMr Trump has hinted he would prefer a diplomatic solution, saying a new deal with Iran would be \"nice\".\n\nBut Mr Araghchi said it would take a lot more than that for Iran to be convinced it should begin negotiations with the US towards another deal, given what happened with the first.\n\n\"The situation is different and much more difficult than the previous time,\" he said. \"Lots of things should be done by the other side to buy our confidence\u2026 We haven't heard anything but the 'nice' word, and this is obviously not enough.\"\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update.

The re-elected president's proposal that Gaza is cleaned out of Palestinians has prompted outrage across the region.\n\nMr Araghchi mocked the idea with one of his own: \"My suggestion is something else. Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis, take them to Greenland so they can kill two birds with one stone.\"\n\nImage: Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on 1 October, 2024\n\nImage: Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts Iranian rockets.

But at the same time, they are rebuilding themselves, because as I said, this is a school of thought, this is an idea, this is a cause, this is an ideal that will always be there.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIranians hope deal could be done with West\n\nIranians we spoke to on the streets of Tehran said they hoped a deal could be done with the West if it could lead to a lifting of sanctions and an improvement in Iran's dire economic fortunes.\n\nSome estimates place inflation at 50%, while youth unemployment is near 20% and the currency is at an all-time low.\n\nTrust between Iran and America is also at rock bottom levels.

                "text": "Doctors have begun the first global study of why some people with cancer beat the odds and survive so much longer than expected.\n\nMany cancer specialists have anecdotal stories of patients who have overcome even the most aggressive forms of the disease, despite being given only months to live.\n\nThe Rosalind study will now bring together large numbers of 'super survivors', allowing scientists to look for clues to why they have responded so well to treatment, while others die.\n\nIn the past doctors may have put stark differences in survival down to luck.\n\nBut Dr Thankamma Ajithkumar, who is leading the UK arm of the study at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, said the hunt was on for a more scientific reason.\n\n\"This is the first time anybody has tried to answer this question why there is a select group of people who do exceptionally well after these dreadful cancers,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"We will have a much larger database to say more confidently that this is what is making you live longer.\"\n\nThe study will focus on some of the most aggressive forms of the disease - extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, the brain cancer glioblastoma, and metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nJust 3% to 5% of patients are still alive five years after diagnosis.\n\n'I never believed I was going to die'\n\nKatherine Webster will be joining the study.\n\nShe was found to have a stage four glioblastoma after suffering a seizure on a train.

Apart from tiring easily and having an occasional tremor in her hand, she is well.\n\n\"The thing that really struck me was the study's approach,\" she said.\n\n\"It's looking at the positive effects, why you survive as opposed to why you get ill, which is the normal default setting for studies these days.\n\n\"It synchronised with my approach to the disease.\"\n\nScientists in more than 40 countries - including eight cancer centres in the UK - will take part in the study.\n\nThey'll analyse detailed biological information from more than 1,000 patients and their tumours, comparing genetic mutations, proteins and other factors that may determine their response to treatment.\n\n'We might find targets for drugs'\n\nDr Ajithkumar said: \"We hope to answer our basic curiosity of why somebody is alive.\n\n\"And second, we might find a number of targets for future drugs.\"\n\nThe study is being run by French biotech startup Cure51, with backing from the venture capital firm Sofinnova.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nSurgeons remove tumour through eye socket\n\nNew test uses AI to detect breast cancer\n\nNicolas Wolikow, Cure51's co-founder, told Sky News that the aim was to \"kill cancer\" in 20 years.\n\n\"The ambition of the project is to eradicate cancer,\" he said.\n\n\"If we could unlock these biological mechanisms that are possessed by these survivors and replicate that for the majority of patients, I think we could do it.\"\n\nSuper survivors who are interested in taking part in the UK arm of the study can get more info at https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/news/trust-backs-international-cancer-study-aided-by-super-survivors/",

                "text": "Donald Trump thinks the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claims it has a technical advantage over US rivals, should be \"a wakeup call\" for American AI firms.\n\nDeepSeek says its artificial intelligence models are comparable with those from US giants, like OpenAI which is behind ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, but potentially a fraction of the cost.\n\nThat has triggered a fall in various US shares, especially chipmaker Nvidia which registered a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street.\n\nBut the US president believes the success of the Chinese firm could be helpful to America's AI aspirations.\n\n\"The release of DeepSeek, AI from a Chinese company should be a wakeup call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,\" Mr Trump said in Florida.\n\nImage: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has promised to outperform rival firm DeepSeek. Pic: AP\n\nHe pointed to DeepSeek's ability to use fewer computing resources. \"I view that as a positive, as an asset... you won't be spending as much, and you'll get the same result, hopefully,\" he added.\n\nOn Monday, the DeepSeek assistant had surpassed ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has given his rival some acknowledgement in a post on X, reacting to DeepSeek's R1 \"reasoning\" model - a core part of the AI technology which answers questions.\n\n\"DeepSeek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\" he wrote.\n\nBut Mr Altman was also defiant: \"We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases.\"\n\nWhat is DeepSeek and what does it do? DeepSeek is a startup founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China. Its CEO Liang Wenfeng previously co-founded one of China's top hedge funds, High-Flyer, which focuses on AI-driven quantitative trading. By 2022, it had created a cluster of 10,000 of Nvidia's high-performance chips which are used to build and run AI systems. The US then restricted sales of those chips to China. DeepSeek said recent AI models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing chips, which are not banned in China - suggesting cutting-edge technology might not be critical for AI development. In January 2024 it released R1, a new AI model which it claimed was on par with similar models from US companies, but is cheaper to use depending on the task. Since DeepSeek's chatbot became available as a mobile app it has surpassed rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store.\n\nThere have been concerns DeepSeek could undermine the potentially $500bn (\u00a3401bn) AI investment by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank in Stargate which Mr Trump announced last week at the White House.\n\nThat project essentially aims to build vastly more computing power to boost AI development.\n\nBut while addressing Republicans in Miami, Mr Trump remained upbeat. He claimed that Chinese leaders had told him the US had the most brilliant scientists in the world.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update.

We're always first. So I would say that's a positive that could be very much a positive development.\n\n\"So instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with, hopefully, the same solution,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nThe intense attention on the Chinese firm has not all been good news though. It reported suffering \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its services.\n\nThe company said it was hit by a cyber attack on Monday which disrupted users' ability to register on the site.",

This includes:\n\n\u2022 An apparent initial lack of awareness about the threats from drones and artillery, with North Korean soldiers attacking on foot \"like something out of World War Two\" in groups of 20, 40 or even 60 men, making themselves easy targets\n\n\u2022 \"Brainwashing\" which means they keep pushing forward despite being under Ukrainian fire and with comrades being killed and wounded around them\n\n\u2022 A desire to remove evidence of their presence from the warzone, with North Koreans in white helmets spotted trying to recover the wounded and the dead\n\n\u2022 A refusal to be taken alive, with claims that North Koreans have been seen blowing themselves up with grenades rather than risk capture. Puls even claimed a North Korean has been heard shouting \"For General Kim Jong Un\" before killing himself\n\n\u2022 Poor coordination between North Korean and Russian forces because of the language barrier. One soldier claimed radio intercepts revealed North Koreans accidentally targeted Russian positions. He also said they would storm Ukrainian positions, suffering losses, but Russian troops would then fail to exploit the gains\n\n\u2022 Better kit than many Russians, including rifles and uniform, but a lack of heavy armour, with North Koreans only moving on foot and using golf buggies to transport ammunition.\n\n\"They were all clean-shaven and perfectly groomed, like models,\" said Puls.\n\n\"Every single one - no beards, unkempt hair, or bald heads\u2026 It was also hard to determine their age. They all looked between 25 and 35, maybe up to 40.\"\n\nImage: Ukrainian special forces during the operation\n\nNorth Korean troop deployment not officially confirmed\n\nUkraine and its Western allies say Pyongyang has sent 11,000 troops to join Russia's war, focusing on bolstering infantry lines in the Kursk region where Ukrainian troops captured swathes of territory in a daring invasion last August.\n\nNeither Kim Jong-Un nor Vladimir Putin have officially confirmed the deployment.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed last week that some 4,000 North Korean soldiers have already been killed or injured.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nCivilians in Democratic Republic of Congo face frenzy of fear\n\nLukashenko set to extend 30-year presidential rule in Belarus\n\nImage: A Ukrainian commander, who goes by the codename 'Puls'\n\nPuls commands the 1st Combat Divers Battalion of Special Operations Forces.\n\nHis elite commandos were tasked with capturing DNA samples and documents from a unit of about 25 North Korean soldiers who were killed in a drone and artillery barrage about a fortnight ago inside Kursk.\n\nBody camera footage from the mission has been shared with Sky News. Edited clips have also been posted on social media.\n\nImage: Samples of saliva and hair are taken from dead North Koreans\n\nForensic samples taken\n\nUkrainian soldiers can be seen carefully sticking cottonwool buds into the mouths of dead North Korean troops to take samples of saliva and place them in an evidence bag.\n\nThey then remove the troops' helmets, cutting clumps of hair and bagging them as well.\n\nIn addition, body armour is cut away so the Ukrainians can more easily access the documents and other items on each soldier, including military identity cards, dog tags, handwritten notes and photographs.\n\nImage: There was also evidence of loved ones back home\n\n'North Koreans only had ammo and chocolate'\n\nOne of Puls's men, who took part in the operation and goes by the codename \"Trainer\", said he was surprised that the North Koreans only had ammunition and chocolate as supplies to sustain them in the fight.\n\n\"Not a single soldier had a water bottle,\" he said.\n\n\"They rely on the idea that they will storm through, take positions, and then eat and survive off our supplies.\"\n\nAsked what personal belongings he found, Trainer said: \"There were letters. Of course, there were notebooks, notes. There were hand-drawn maps\u2026 There were photos of children, mothers, letters they tried to send home.\"\n\nImage: Military identity cards were Russian, suggesting a bid to hide the true ethnicity of the troops\n\nThe military identity cards were Russian - a seemingly clumsy attempt to hide the true ethnicity of the soldiers.\n\nTrainer said some of the notes appeared to be of soldiers' experiences in battle. He said it seemed as though they were trying to learn from their exposure to modern warfare.\n\n\"It's the experience they are accumulating for their country, for conflicts they might face in the future,\" he said.\n\nNorth Koreans 'more disciplined'\n\nPuls described how the North Koreans fought differently from the Russians.\n\n\"They are far more disciplined, with exceptional morale and determination - completely brainwashed, really,\" he said.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update. Tap here to follow\n\nPuls said about a fortnight ago he noticed the North Koreans pulling back.\n\n\"The Russians are standing, working everywhere along the frontline, but no Koreans,\" he said.\n\n\"Either they're analysing their mistakes, or tending to their wounds, or maybe they're waiting for reinforcements. There's talk that Kim Jong-Un is sending more North Koreans here. That's the situation.\"\n\nHe said intercepted Russian communications appeared to indicate they would be returning.\n\n\"They're still present, training or waiting for reinforcements.

                "text": "The chairman of a coalition which successfully lobbied Arab-Americans to vote for Donald Trump has slammed the new president for his weekend comments on Gaza.\n\n\"Arab-Americans for Trump firmly rejects President Donald J Trump's suggestion to remove - voluntarily or forcibly - Palestinians in Gaza to Egypt and Jordan,\" said Dr Bishara Bahbah, national chair of Arab Americans for Trump.\n\nThe statement signals an early sign of tension with a key demographic which helped push President Trump over the line in November.\n\nA critical number of Arab-Americans in places like Michigan helped propel Mr Trump to victory. Small margins in cities like Dearborn and Hamtramck were key to Mr Trump's success.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:47 In November, Dr Bishara Bahbah was happy about Donald Trump's election win\n\nThe statement, released late on Sunday and described as an \"urgent press release\", said: \"We strongly believe that the ONLY resolution to the Israel-Palestine is a two-state solution\u2026 Arab Americans for Trump thank the President for imposing a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"We expect that the President and his team work on the rebuilding of Gaza and launching the process that would culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.\"\n\nDr Bahbah, who is Palestinian by birth and has since become a successful American businessman, was pivotal in his efforts to persuade Arab-Americans to choose Mr Trump.\n\nHe rallied an army of influencers in a successful \"ground game\" throughout the election campaign to energise support for President Trump.\n\nHe has told Sky News that President Trump personally committed to a two-state solution and that he believes the president has a \"contract\" with the Arab-Americans who voted for him.\n\n\"Mr President, we have a contract\u2026.\" he said. \"We held up our end of the contract and voted for you. We are with you to ensure that your administration fulfils your part of the contract.\"\n\nImage: People in Gaza hope to be allowed to return to the northern part of the strip. Pic: Reuters\n\nOver the weekend, President Trump suggested that Gaza could be \"cleaned out\" and that Palestinians could be moved to Jordan or Egypt.\n\n\"I'd like him to take people,\" the president said, referring to his conversation with Jordan's King Abdullah on Saturday.\n\n\"You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing. You know, over the century, it's had many, many conflicts. And I don't know, something has to happen\u2026 I'd like Egypt to take people,\" Mr Trump said, adding that he plans to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al Sisi.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update.

                "text": "A prominent Republican senator and longtime ally of Donald Trump has questioned his decision to pardon January 6 rioters.\n\nLindsey Graham said the move was a \"mistake\" and could lead to more violence.\n\nMr Trump announced a blanket pardon for about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol in 2021 as part of a flurry of executive orders.\n\nSome of those who were freed from jail earlier this week had assaulted police officers during the insurrection.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:55 January 6 rioters reunite with families\n\nRepublican senator Mr Graham said while Mr Trump had the legal authority to issue the pardons, \"pardoning the people who went into the Capitol and beat up a police officer violently, I think was a mistake. Because it seems to suggest that's an okay thing to do\".\n\nAs a result, \"I fear that you will get more violence\", said Mr Graham, who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nMr Trump has said that attacks on police officers during the January 6 unrest were \"minor incidents\".\n\nIn his first sit-down interview since being inaugurated on Monday, recorded in the Oval Office, Mr Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity most of those who were jailed over the US Capitol riots were \"absolutely innocent\".\n\nHe went on to claim those at the US Capitol were simply there \"protesting the vote\" before again falsely claiming the 2020 election was \"rigged\".\n\nImage: Senator Lindsey Graham speaks during a Donald Trump campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2020. Pic: Reuters\n\nAmong those supporters who have been released from prison was Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group.\n\nRhodes had been serving an 18-year sentence after being convicted of plotting to use force to prevent Congress from certifying Mr Trump's 2020 defeat to rival Joe Biden.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump and Starmer speak on phone and 'agree to meet soon'\n\nPresident praises PM for doing 'very good job'\n\nWhy Trump sees Churchill as an icon to emulate\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:05 Trump addresses Capitol riot pardons\n\nThe blanket pardon also drew condemnation from police who battled the mob, their families, and politicians, including some of the president's fellow Republicans.\n\nGraham also hits out at Biden pardons\n\nSpeaking on NBC's Meet the Press programme, Mr Graham also criticised Mr Trump's predecessor Democrat Mr Biden for issuing last-minute pardons for five family members and said Americans may want to revisit presidential pardon power if such actions continue.\n\n\"But as to pardoning violent people who beat up cops, I think that's a mistake,\" he said.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

                "text": "How smart is AI these days? Not smart enough, it seems, to spot a Chinese competitor coming apparently from nowhere.\n\nAI assistant DeepSeek was developed in China by hedge fund entrepreneur Liang Wengfeng as a side project, intended, he says, only for research.\n\nIts latest iteration, which appeared on Apple's app store and Google Play a week ago, has demonstrated capabilities apparently equal to its better known, and apparently far more costly rivals, led by ChatGPT, owned by OpenAI.\n\nIn a research paper published last year, DeepSeek said it had been developed using only \"limited capability\" Nvidia chips - the most advanced technology has been banned from China under export controls since 2022 - and had cost a mere $5.6m (\u00a34.5m) to develop.\n\nIts success appears to pose a fundamental challenge to the received wisdom that the development of AI will require huge investment, vast computing power housed in energy-hungry data centres, and be a race run and won in America.\n\nLast week Donald Trump heralded a \u00a3500bn investment project, including $100bn from OpenAI. Google, Meta, Microsoft and the ubiquitous Elon Musk are all in the race, desperate to be first to find the holy grail of artificial general intelligence - a theoretical concept that describes a machine's ability to learn and understand any intellectual task that a human can.\n\nThat now looks like a contest not just between Californian tech bros with macho budgets, but between superpowers.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nThe implications were clear on US stock markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down 3%, a loss of a trillion dollars, and Nvidia itself fell almost 17%, shedding $600bn (\u00a3482bn) from its market value and losing its status as the world's biggest company in the process. Google's parent company fell in value by \u00a3100bn and Microsoft, which has a stake in the privately held OpenAI, was down \u00a37bn.\n\nAs well as questions about the cost and capability of US models, those losses also demonstrate investor desperation to be on the right side of perhaps the most important 'general technology' since electricity. It seems certain AI will change the world, but no-one can yet say with certainty precisely how, when or in what way.\n\nThere is much about DeepSeek we do not yet know. How reliable, for example, is that development figure?\n\nAnd while established US models are capable of \"hallucinations\", in which they make things up, DeepSeek appears to have selective memory. Ask it about Tiananmen Square, or other issues and events blocked in China, and it cannot help.\n\nThat speaks to wider concerns about the role of Chinese technology that has seen US authorities seek to ban TikTok, and the UK government strip Huawei tech from the communication network.\n\nFor now however users around the world seem relaxed; deepseek is the most downloaded app on the Apple store this week.",

                "text": "Los Angeles has been warned by an Olympics presidential candidate that as 2028 host city it must be better prepared to handle climate emergencies after the recent deadly wildfires.\n\nJohan Eliasch, a billionaire member of the International Olympic Committee, spoke to Sky News about issues with LA's readiness amid scrutiny over how $17.8m (\u00a314.5m) in budget cuts slowed the response to blazes earlier this month.\n\nWhile no major sports venues were damaged, widespread rebuilding of housing and infrastructure will be required as the city prepares, not only for the Olympics and Paralympics, but 2026 World Cup matches and the 2027 Super Bowl.\n\n\"It shows that we're all into this together and climate readiness for climate security issues is paramount,\" said Mr Eliasch, head of the International Ski Federation.\n\n\"The lesson from this is that we need to make sure that [Olympics] organisers have the capacity and capabilities to deal with extreme weather events, because it's not going to be less of it, it's going to be more.\"\n\nThe fires were fuelled by powerful winds and drought-like conditions but Mr Eliasch's comments chime with deepening political debate in California over any mistakes by authorities - particularly over funding.\n\n\"Here is where climate readiness is paramount \u2026 and we need to make sure, for future Olympic hosts, they have the capabilities to deal with it. Now, fortunately, we have three and a half years to go,\" Mr Eliasch said.\n\n\"It is for communities to push governments for this, because as we have seen with more flooding, with extreme snowfall, these are things that we need to be prepared for,\" the IOC member added.\n\nImage: The Olympic flag returned to Los Angeles for the first time in 40 years in August. Pic: Reuters\n\nBy March, although considered an outsider in the IOC vote, Mr Eliasch hopes to beat six rivals to be voted president to run the Olympics.\n\nThe British-Swedish tycoon made his fortune through the Head sportswear firm and has advised both the Conservative and Labour parties.\n\nTransgender debate\n\nOne of the key issues facing the successor to Thomas Bach at the IOC is whether transgender women have a place in women's sport.\n\n\"The integrity of women's sport is at stake,\" Mr Eliasch said, before providing a more nuanced argument.\n\nThere is a call for \"clear rules\", whereas the IOC currently leaves it for individual sports to decide.\n\nWorld Athletics, led by rival IOC candidate Lord Coe, has a complete ban on transgender women from women's events, unlike in skiing.\n\nImage: 'We need to have a fair, level playing field', says Mr Eliasch. Pic: AP\n\n\"Everybody has the right to compete,\" Mr Eliasch said.\n\n\"If you're born with XX chromosomes, you're a woman. The difficulty arises when you analyse variations in DNA and how that impacts physical ability.\n\n\"And we need to have a fair, level playing field. And if you start messing around with that, it doesn't work. It has to be based on science and biological facts. It's the only way to deal with it.\"\n\nOlympics in Africa?\n\nThere is concern about climate change restricting the number of places capable of hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nAnd Mr Eliasch suggests a rotation scheme of 10 potential venues that share the Games over the next 40 years.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\n\"That way, investments are kept up, places are maintained, and we don't waste a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nOn the Summer Olympics, he is keen for Africa and the Middle East to have a chance at hosting for the first time - with the 2036 city the next to be chosen.\n\n\"We need to go to new places and I'm not against going to Africa,\" he said.\n\n\"It will take preparation.

That's the only understanding I have; there's no other way.\"\n\nImage: 'A just peace is the return of our territory,' Major Vladyslav Tovstii said\n\nBattle-hardened despite his young age, Vladyslav has been fighting since before Russia launched its all-out invasion on 24 February 2022.\n\nStanding in front of a wall of screens, showing video feeds from surveillance aircraft and attack drones, the commander gave his view on the possibility of some sort of compromise deal with Vladimir Putin - something that Mr Trump may well attempt to achieve.\n\n\"It would mean that justice in the world is not as I see it,\" Major Tovstii said.\n\n\"A compromise is no longer about justice; it's about concessions, which means that if you are stronger, you can take what you want.\"\n\nHis brigade is among the units attempting to stop a grinding Russian advance towards the frontline city of Pokrovsk.\n\nRead more:\n\nPM: UK will play 'full part' in peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine\n\nOn the ground in Ukraine as three killed in airstrikes\n\nThe use of drones is a key way for Ukraine to compensate for a lack of manpower compared to the number of soldiers Russia is sacrificing daily for every inch of captured land.\n\nBut Russian forces also operate large numbers of unmanned aircraft, with each side constantly adapting their machines to be able to fly further and carry larger payloads.\n\nAnother evolution is in the area of electronic warfare, which is designed to jam the signals of enemy drones and force them out of the sky. Countering this threat is critical.\n\nSky News was given exclusive access to a makeshift Ukrainian drone factory where engineers and other specialists from the marine brigade adapt aircraft to give them a better chance of defeating Russian jamming efforts and flying deeper into Russian-held territory.\n\n\"If you don't want to sacrifice your men, your soldiers, you better make this fight distant, right?\" said a technician at the factory, who went by the name \"Cartman\" from the cartoon series South Park.\n\nHe said the success rate for his unit's drones is slightly above 50%, but even that level is getting harder to sustain as Russia improves its electronic warfare tactics.\n\nArmed with tools and hunched over drone parts, the team here is working as hard as ever despite growing uncertainty about the future of the war.\n\n\"This is such a waste of time, of my time,\" said Cartman, who volunteered to join the military last year, giving up a senior job at an international company. He spoke in English.\n\n\"While some people are creating technologies to save life and to make life better, we are working on technologies - not just to kill the enemy, but to destroy him completely.\n\n\"This is out of (contrary to) common sense, but we have no choice. There's no way out. We have to win this war.\"\n\nImage: Cartman warned Donald Trump 'you cannot make friends with a shark attacking you'\n\nAsked what his message was for Mr Trump, Cartman said: \"You cannot make friends with a shark attacking you.

Because we say never again, but where was never again in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, or the acts of genocide against Yazidi?\n\n\"Today, we have to make those words mean more. So we will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour.\"\n\nHeightened security at London event shows lessons still to be learnt Lisa Holland Communities correspondent @LisaatSky Survivors lit candles and gave their own moving testimonies at the London commemorations of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides. The London Youth Chamber Choir performed Even When He Is Silent - remembering six million lost Jewish voices. The Prince of Wales spoke about remembering not only survivors but also recalled those who risked their own lives to protect those fleeing - which included his great-grandmother Alice who gave refuge to a Jewish widow and her children in Athens. The message of the ceremony to the congregation and beyond at a time of growing fears over anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish sentiment - to light candles of their own and stand against prejudice and hatred. Candles to light the darkness 'for a better future'. But the heightened security ahead of and at the venue at a time of continuing conflict in the world tells us lessons are still to be learnt on this 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.\n\n'Remembering the evils of the past remains vital'\n\nSpeaking in Krakow earlier on Monday, the King said: \"In a world that remains full of turmoil and strife, and has witnessed the dangerous re-emergence of antisemitism, there can be no more important message.\n\n\"As the number of Holocaust survivors regrettably diminishes with the passage of time, the responsibility of remembrance rests far heavier on our shoulders and on those of generations yet unborn.\n\n\"The act of remembering the evils of the past remains a vital task, and in so doing, we inform our present and shape our future.\n\n\"Here in Krakow, from the ashes of the Holocaust, the Jewish community has been reborn.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nSurvivors mark liberation from Auschwitz 80 years ago\n\n'My mother sacrificed herself for me'\n\nImage: The King speaking in Krakow.

Pic: Reuters\n\nKing's poignant journey to Auschwitz a display of his lifelong commitment to Holocaust survivors Rhiannon Mills Royal correspondent @SkyRhiannon The King had a clear purpose as he made his first visit to Auschwitz. Remembrance - but also the high cost of forgetting. It was right at the heart of a speech he gave at a Jewish community centre in Krakow, which he opened in 2008; a reminder of his enduring work to champion religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue, ever mindful of what he can do with his global profile. In the auditorium at Auschwitz, he was one of the most recognisable attendees. But as is so often the case with the Royal Family, his intention was to use his presence to draw even greater attention to those who really matter, the survivors. The Holocaust Educational Trust described his attendance as elevating the event on a global stage, a signal to the world of its significance. It was a display of his lifelong commitment to humanise and give a voice to those who 80 years ago were so savagely dehumanised at the hands of the Nazis.\n\n'I remember watching children driven to their deaths'\n\nSurvivor Janina Iwanska said that while the camp was originally for political prisoners, in March 1942, \"the operators of the camp started building gas chambers and the crematorium\".\n\n\"It was no longer a POW camp, a Soviet camp - this is when the killing machine started its operation,\" she added.\n\n\"It is difficult to calculate all the people killed here.\"\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nFellow survivor Tova Friedman also told those in attendance: \"I remember as a five-year-old child watching from my hiding place as all my little friends were rounded up and driven to their deaths while the heartbreaking cries of their parents fell on deaf ears.\n\n\"After all the children were gone and the courtyard was empty - I thought 'am I the only Jewish child left in the world?'\"\n\nShe recalled that while held in Auschwitz, she \"was being beaten mercilessly by a guard for fidgeting\" after \"not being able to stand still for hours,\" as she looked into her mother's eyes.\n\n\"She was pleading with me 'don't cry'.

                "text": "A retired senior police chief has told an inquiry the Royal Military Police's initial investigation into alleged war crimes by UK Special Forces in Afghanistan was \"slow to commence, sluggish in its progress, and never properly resourced\".\n\nAlan Pughsley QPM, who has 39 years of experience in investigating serious and organised crimes, had been asked by the Independent Inquiry Relating to Afghanistan to produce a desktop review of two RMP investigations including Operation Northmoor which began in March 2014.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating claims made in a BBC Panorama programme that innocent Afghan civilians were executed by three out of four SAS squadrons between 2010 and 2013.\n\nEvidence submitted to the inquiry suggests as many as 80 people were killed this way during a campaign of night raids.\n\nThe RMP launched Operation Northmoor on 31 March 2014, three years after the alleged war crimes.\n\nMr Pughsley, whose conclusions have not yet been finalised, said the most senior investigating officer (SIO) lacked experience for such a significant investigation.\n\nHe identified Operation Northmoor as a Category A investigation - the most serious of its kind but said it \"did not progress at the pace, breadth or depth that is required for a Category A investigation\".\n\nHe said the investigation's gold commanders kept few records, minutes were scant, and very few key witnesses were spoken to on time.\n\nGuidance from independent advisors was often not heeded, he said, adding he had not seen sufficient evidence of proper handovers being made when multiple changes were made to investigating staff.\n\nThe inquiry heard there was a \"confusing landscape,\" where at one time four external advisers were offering differing guidelines to the RMP investigators.\n\nA critical delay in starting the investigation, which Mr Pughsley said was not the fault of the RMP, denied early opportunities for gathering contemporaneous witness accounts.\n\nThe former police chief criticised the appointment of some investigators saying many lacked skills and experience, including an SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) who had only just attended the relevant training course and had never acted as the SIO in any, or any serious, investigation.\n\n\"There was consideration to whether or not a Home Office Police Force could or should've been utilised as lead investigators\", Mr Pughsley said before explaining that the Ministry of Defence chose the RMP instead to lead.\n\n\"I would've asked a Home Office police force to identify an incredibly experienced ISO,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry's counsel Mr Oliver Glasgow KC put to Mr Pughsley: \"We remind ourselves, this would have been an enormous challenge for even a highly experienced SIO from the Home Office Police Force.\"\n\nMr Pughsley replied: \"Absolutely right.\"\n\nFour years to set up resources\n\nOperation Northmoor was described by the former police chief as \"a complex and incredibly serious investigation that was fundamentally poorly resourced.\"\n\nThe inquiry heard how it took two years to find premises and two more to get all the required resources in place.\n\n\"If you feel not supported whether as an investigator or one of the senior officers, I think you would feel very, very disappointed and I guess you would feel 'how seriously are we taking this?' Or are we just rubber-stamping the definition and not putting the resources into it?' I hope that's not the case,\" Mr Pughsley said.\n\nLater, the inquiry heard \u00a37m was spent on the creation of a forensics data handling centre which was eventually blocked from being used.\n\nClosure 'inappropriate and premature'\n\nMr Pughsley said there were \"clearly outstanding lines of enquiry that were not followed\", including a large number of potential witnesses in Afghanistan and data and digital evidence. He added the decision to close Operation Northmore was \"inappropriate and premature\".\n\nOperation Northmoor was set up in 2014 to examine allegations of executions by special forces, including those of children.\n\nNo charges were ever brought.\n\nRead more:\n\nArrest warrant for Taliban duo\n\nSAS had 'golden pass' in Afghanistan\n\nOperation Cestro, which followed, referred three soldiers to the Service Prosecuting Authority but there were no prosecutions.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nLaw firm Leigh Day, representing the bereaved families at the inquiry, said its clients have always maintained Operation Northmoor was deeply flawed.\n\n\"Mr Pughsley\u2026 has raised potential failings at almost every stage of the investigation,\" said Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day.\n\n\"Perhaps most concerningly, he considers that the investigation was closed prematurely and inappropriately with major lines of enquiry still outstanding.\n\n\"Plainly the inquiry now needs to take further evidence from those who were involved with both running and overseeing Operation Northmoor to find out how this complex, multi-homicide military police investigation went so badly wrong.\"\n\nThe inquiry continues.",

Pic: Reuters\n\nThe 200-page document, titled \"Gaza Phoenix\" and shared with Sky News by an official in Gaza City's Hamas-led local government, is the first comprehensive reconstruction plan to be published since the war began.\n\nGaza Phoenix sets out short, medium and long-term priorities for reconstruction and development in the territory, starting almost from scratch.\n\nThe immediate priorities include formalising displacement camps, repairing hospitals, clearing rubble and restoring law and order.\n\nThere are also much more ambitious long-term proposals, including a tourism-focused economy, a green belt and even Dubai-style artificial islands.\n\nOne section, on \"wartime resilience\", suggests constructing \"an underground connecter\" between all Gaza cities - a proposal likely to anger Israel, which has sought to destroy Hamas's underground tunnel network.\n\nInternational donors would be very unlikely to directly fund the activities of Gaza's Hamas-led municipal governments, a person familiar with reconstruction efforts told Sky News.\n\nBut the project could be delivered by aid groups, the source said, which have historically coordinated with Gaza's local administrations.\n\nForeign donors, like the Gulf States, see reconstruction as an opportunity to have influence in post-war Gaza. However, they will have reservations over putting billions of dollars into Gaza's reconstruction without an internationally agreed and comprehensive plan for stability, as well as assurances of some Palestinian autonomy.\n\nImage: Displaced Palestinians attempt to return to their homes in northern Gaza.

Instead, he is simply trying to find some empty land on which to pitch a tent amidst the rubble.\n\nThe destruction of homes in Gaza, and the immense quantities of debris strewn through its streets, has prompted many families to take shelter in schools.\n\n\"For more than one year the students have not gone to school, and they haven't had any chance to go to school because all the schools are used as shelters,\" says Mr Salem.\n\nSatellite analysis by aid group Education Cluster suggests that 88% of schools in Gaza have been damaged, including every single school in North Gaza.\n\nMr Abu Riziq, a schoolteacher, thinks it will take between six to 12 months before schools are able to reopen.\n\nThat is echoed in the Gaza Phoenix reconstruction plan, which does not anticipate a resumption of schooling within the next six months.\n\nFor the time being, the best scenario for Gaza's children is to enrol in one of the territory's growing number of tent schools.\n\nIn May last year, Mr Abu Riziq set up his own tent school using the leftover parachute from an aid drop. He has since expanded to five schools, providing education and psychological support to around 2,000 children aged five to 14.\n\nHe is optimistic that, with proper support and counselling, Gaza's children will be able to overcome their traumas.\n\n\"Most of our students, when we first tell them to draw, they draw tanks, destroyed houses, how they suffered,\" he says.\n\n\"But now, after many sessions, they draw gardens, sunflowers, a plane they are in, trees with apples that they can eat.

                "text": "There are few who can say they've seen the inside of hell, but Albrecht Weinberg is one of them.\n\nFrom the safety of his living room, the 99-year-old describes how, as a teenager, he survived three concentration camps including the biggest Nazi extermination centre, Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\n\"Jews were only for the gas chamber. You worked until you could work no more. Then you went to the chimney,\" he explains in a soft Brooklyn twang he picked up after years of living in New York.\n\nBorn into a Jewish family of five in the East Frisia region of Germany, Albrecht was a teenager when the Nazis first sent him to do forced labour in 1939.\n\nImage: Albrecht Weinberg survived three concentration camps\n\nHe was moved to various places in the next few years until, in April 1943, he and his sister were loaded on to a wagon to Auschwitz.\n\nThe Third Reich was accelerating its extermination of Jews as part of its \"Final Solution\" which would see more than six million killed in the Holocaust.\n\nAlbrecht had already been separated from his parents, who had been immediately sent to gas chambers.\n\nNow, he was being unloaded at a place where they, and ultimately more than a million other people, were murdered.\n\nAlbrecht remembers that around 950 men, women, children and the elderly were on the train but he had no clue what Auschwitz was.\n\n\"I'd never seen a prisoner in a striped uniform and cap,\" he says.\n\nAs the train doors opened, he remembers soldiers shouting, \"Out! Out!\" in German.\n\nImage: A photo taken by the Nazis in the early days of World War Two shows victims arriving at Auschwitz. File pic: AP\n\nTerrified, exhausted and dehydrated after days on the train, people rushed out, stepping over one another.\n\nThe group was then forced to march in front of one of the commanders so they could be selected.\n\nSome would be sent to work, the rest to their deaths.\n\n\"He sorted us like big and small potatoes,\" Albrecht tells me, \"[If] he thought maybe that you could do a day's work, he gave you a sign that you should go to the right and the others had to go to the left.\"\n\nAlbrecht was one of around 250 chosen to be kept alive so that they could work.\n\nHe was sent to Auschwitz III (Monowitz) camp where by day he had to do backbreaking labour, laying cables in the freezing weather.\n\nImage: Albrecht's father, Alfred (sitting) with his brother Jacob during World War One\n\nBy night he had to sleep in a shared bunk in cramped, cold wooden huts, riddled with disease and with little sanitation.\n\nThis is how he spent almost two years.\n\n\"They came and they beat the daylights out of you and then you had to get outside. You can't stay alive very long and do that kind of work with that little bit of food that you got,\" he says explaining what his days were like.\n\nIn the camp, he met his older brother Dieter, who had been sent there before him.\n\nThe detainees weren't seen as humans, he says they were reduced to less than animals.\n\nImage: 'Every day when I wash myself, I see my number,' says Albrecht\n\nRolling up his sleeve, Albrecht shows me the now-faded grey tattoo scrawled onto his skin by the Nazis when he arrived.\n\n\"1-16-9-27: that was my name, my number, that was everything,\" he says, lightly tapping his arm.\n\nHe remembers the SS guards would inspect them; if they looked too skinny, had sores or were too weak, they were executed.\n\n\"He wrote your number down, the next day you went to the chimney.\"\n\nAlbrecht explains, quietly: \"People died, that was their policy. Over a million people got burned.\"\n\nSomehow though, Albrecht managed to survive until January 1945 when the guards told him and a group of others they were leaving.\n\nAs Soviet troops closed in, the Nazis forced thousands of Auschwitz detainees on so-called \"death marches\", moving people they thought could still work to other areas.\n\nAlbrecht was among them and remembers seeing starving and sick people die on the route.\n\nWearing thin clothes and ill-fitting wooden clogs, the detainees marched for miles.\n\nAnyone who stopped or fainted was shot or beaten to death.\n\nAfter the march, Albrecht was forced to work in a factory making rockets and bombs before finally being sent to Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany.\n\nYears of forced labour, beatings, malnutrition and trauma meant by this time he was dying.\n\nImage: The filthy conditions of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. File pic: AP\n\nHe remembers lying on the ground among a sea of corpses, too exhausted to go on.\n\nThat's where he was when British forces arrived and liberated the camp.\n\n\"I must have moved my arm or something. I was 90% a dead man,\" he says as he describes the scene that greeted the soldiers.\n\nAlbrecht says the Bergen-Belsen camp had become a \"cemetery\".\n\n\"There were thousands of dead people lying on top of the ground. They were not buried, some of them were decomposing. The smell was awful,\" he says.\n\nAfter being worked as a slave and then left to die like an animal, Albrecht was finally free.\n\nAfter the war, he was reunited with his brother and sister who also managed to survive Auschwitz.\n\nImage: Left to right: Albrecht, his brother Dieter and his sister Friedel\n\nHe later relocated to America, only returning to Germany in 2011.\n\nAlbrecht will be at home as the world gathers to remember the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.\n\nHe has only returned to the camp once - \"once was enough,\" he says.\n\nInstead, he is one of several survivors whose memories are being broadcast online as part of a project by the Jewish Claims Conference to mark the anniversary.\n\nIn total, around 41 members of Albrecht's family were murdered by the Nazis.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nHe says he \"cannot forgive\" Germany.\n\nHe knows that younger generations are not responsible for the crimes of their grandparents, but he's also deeply concerned about ongoing antisemitism.\n\nLast year, someone knocked over the gravestones in the Jewish Cemetery in Leer where he lives.\n\nAlbrecht was so terrified he couldn't go out.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nHe says he thought it was a \"second Holocaust\".\n\nIn March, he will celebrate his 100th birthday.\n\nHe doesn't know for how much longer Auschwitz survivors will be able to tell their stories and he's worried the world is already forgetting the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nImage: Albrecht's mother Flora and her sister Carolina\n\nFor this extraordinary man, a survivor of indescribable trauma and a witness to some of the darkest acts in history, there is no peace.\n\n\"How can I forget when I think about my family, my mother, my father, my grandma?

There are people who are committed to his return, and they are working tirelessly right now to bring him home.\n\n\"That gives us tremendous hope, tremendous optimism.

I think the urgency for us as a family has increased because we know that in chaos there are opportunities for change, there are options to reset the status quo and to change the way that things have been.\n\n\"But in terms of the previous 12 years, yes, we have always believed every day that we will be reunited with our brother.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nOn Sunday, the FBI said in a statement that a $1m (\u00a3782,000) reward was still on offer for information leading to Mr Tice's \"safe location, recovery and return\".\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Sunday, President Biden said his administration believed Mr Tice was still alive, but that they were trying to pinpoint his location in a country trying to find stability after the rapid fall of the Assad dynasty.",

                "text": "Ronan Keating says the members of Boyzone were \"unprotected\" and in \"a dangerous space\" when they were propelled to fame over 30 years ago.\n\nSpeaking at the worldwide premiere of Boyzone: No Matter What, the 47-year-old singer told Sky News: \"We just played along with it all. I was 16, 17, 18 years of age. I was a child.\"\n\nImage: Boyzone in 1995. Pic: AP\n\nNow a father of five, Keating goes on: \"But as you get older and your children get older\u2026 you realise what we went through as kids and how unprotected we were and what a dangerous space it was.\"\n\nIn 1993, five working-class lads from Dublin, Ronan Keating, Stephen Gately, Keith Duffy, Shane Lynch and Mikey Graham were plucked from obscurity by talent manager Louis Walsh and moulded into stars.\n\nBreaking into the UK charts the following year, they had conquered the world by the mid-1990s.\n\nSix number one hits and five number one albums followed, with 25 million records sold across the world.\n\nA master of promotion, former X Factor judge Walsh worked hard to keep the boys' names in the papers, but that exposure came at a cost.\n\nIn October, the death of ex-One Direction star Liam Payne after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires had drew a sharp focus on the duty of care offered to those thrust into the spotlight at a young age.\n\nBut Keating says back then it was different: \"Our duty of care would not have been anything. It would never have been taken into account.\"\n\nImage: Keating performing his first solo hit When You Say Nothing At All in 2000. Pic: Reuters\n\nDespite that, he says the band owe Walsh a lot: \"We wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for what Louis did for Boyzone, what he put on the line for us.\n\n\"He has apologised and said sorry for the words that he said, the things he's done. Somewhat. It's tough, it's hard, and at times my relationship with Louis - well, it's non-existent. But I am very grateful for the opportunity he gave Boyzone and me in the beginning.\"\n\nShane Lynch too, is forgiving when it comes to past tabloid press intrusion into his private life.\n\nLynch, 48, tells Sky News: \"A story's a story. A paper's a paper. People like to hear bad stuff about you. That's what gets them going, makes their own life feel better.\n\n\"Sometimes we were subjected to that little bit more than others. But that said, as Louis Walsh says, 'You made the front paper!'\"\n\nImage: Two years into the band. Pic: Fryderyk Gabowicz/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images\n\nSo why now - three decades after they first met, and following two splits - have the band felt the need to tell their story?\n\nKeating says: \"I think with any story you need a start, a middle and an end. And I think we've after 30 years, we've finally got that.\"\n\nOf course, one key element of Boyzone is missing, with the death of Stephen Gately back in 2009 (a result of an undiagnosed heart condition) meaning the five will never again take to the stage.\n\nImage: Band members carried Stephen Gately's coffin at his funeral in 2009. Pic: AP\n\nDespite his loss, the remaining members see the three-part documentary as a form of tribute to their lost member, describing it as a way to celebrate and work with him again.\n\nIn tribute, Keith Duffy, 50, dressed for the event with Gately very much in mind, telling Sky News: \"This shirt is for Steo. He loved a bit of print. He loved a bit of sequins. I found the perfect shirt and red was his favourite colour. I am representing Stephen tonight.\"\n\nMikey Graham, who contributed to the documentary, did not attend the red carpet.\n\nSky News has contacted Louis Walsh for comment.\n\nBoyzone: No Matter What is available on Sky and streaming service Now from Sunday 2 February.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe January transfer closes on Feb. 3 and some of football's biggest clubs -- including many in the Premier League -- are still struggling to find the central striker who can score the goals to transform their season.\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta has said his team need more goals to become title winners, while Manchester United are languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League with a negative goal difference due to a group of forwards who are nowhere near to hitting double figures so far this season.\n\nBut where are the prolific No. 9s capable of making the difference at the biggest clubs?\n\nManchester City's decision to hand Erling Haaland a 9\u00bd-year contract highlights the lack of proven goal scorers in the game who have the ability and character to deliver at the top clubs. So, with several clubs in need of goals, Tor-Kristian Karlsen and Mark Ogden have taken on the role of sporting director to identify the best options out there -- and potential gambles that might make all the difference -- and devise some \"best case,\" video-game scenarios that won't happen because they make too much sense.\n\nTIER 1: Elite players who will make a difference\n\nVictor Osimhen is clearly destined for a bigger stage when his loan spell in Turkey comes to an end, but where will he go? Isa Terli/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nVICTOR OSIMHEN\n\nAge: 26\n\nClub: Galatasaray, on loan from Napoli until end of 2024-25 season\n\nForm this season: 15 goals, six assists in 19 games (all competitions)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac75m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2027\n\nWhat you need to know: One of the elite goal scorers in European football in recent years, Osimhen possesses a captivating skillset for a frontman. He never tires of making sharp movements behind the centre-backs, and his finishing capabilities mean he can score from a range of angles, positions and distances. Also, when not in possession, he stretches defences with his runs. Physically, Osimhen sports the almost perfect profile for a No. 9: sharp and athletic, he moves smoothly, with a darting acceleration few can match, and has an impressive vertical leap. There's little doubt that Osimhen exudes the aura of a top star. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Sources have said Manchester United would consider a move for Osimhen if the Nigeria international's season-long loan at Galatasaray could be transferred to another club during the January window, but the 26-year-old's parent team, Napoli, would likely consider such a prospect only if it meant a permanent transfer. That would rule United out. With Osimhen under contract at Napoli until June 2027, and a reported release clause coming into play in the summer, there would be no inexpensive option to do a deal.\n\nHowever, with Napoli rivalling Chelsea for United winger Alejandro Garnacho this month, creative negotiating could open up the prospect of a deal for Osimhen. A permanent deal for Osimhen is not a priority for United, however. They simply need a goal scorer to get through until the end of the season, so unless Osimhen could be signed on loan -- United bought out Wout Weghorst's loan at Besiktas from Burnley two years ago -- it's a nonstarter for United.\n\nElsewhere, Arsenal and Chelsea both need a striker, but both teams opted against a move for Osimhen last summer. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: The dream scenario would be a loan move to United that sees him score 10-15 goals and earn a permanent deal at Old Trafford. The player would get a Premier League move, and United would get their genuine scorer. -- Ogden\n\nBENJAMIN SESKO\n\nAge: 21\n\nClub: RB Leipzig\n\nForm this season: 14 goals, three assists in 26 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac50m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2029\n\nWhat you need to know: Long considered one of the top centre-forward prodigies of his generation by scouts and insiders, the Slovenia international has gone from the signs of promise in his debut Bundesliga season to becoming a regular threat this campaign (14 goals in 26 appearances, all competitions). The 6-foot-5 forward is first and foremost recognised for his outstanding finishing, and strikes the ball with a precision and venom. He's also surprisingly quick for his height once he hits top speed. At 21, Sesko can improve his link-up game, which would transform him from a poacher to an all-around No. 9.\n\nSesko does tend to score in streaks -- he's currently on one, with seven goals in his past eight matches -- but his unproductive periods are becoming fewer and shorter. He's destined for a powerhouse team. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Arsenal looked closely at Sesko last summer and for a time, he seemed destined to leave Leipzig for the Emirates before signing a new contract. But Gunners boss Mikel Arteta had misgivings about the 21-year-old's readiness to make an instant impact in the Premier League, and the transfer fizzled out.\n\nMan United have also held a long-standing interest in the player, dating back to his time at FC Salzburg, but opted to sign Rasmus H\u00f8jlund for \u20ac75m in the summer of 2023 when it became clear that there would be no feasible prospect of buying out Leipzig's deal to sign Sesko from their partner club. A move this month for Sesko had seemed unlikely, but with Leipzig already eliminated from the Champions League, a big offer could persuade the club to offload him before the deadline -- if they decide that the financial benefits outweigh the value in keeping him for the rest of the season to ensure a top-four finish in the Bundesliga. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: A move to Arsenal could be transformative for the Gunners' hopes of success, and with injuries guaranteeing him a starting spot, Sesko would have the chance to make a big impact. -- Ogden\n\nVIKTOR GY\u00d6KERES\n\nAge: 26\n\nClub: Sporting CP\n\nForm this season: 34 goals, six assists in 32 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac75m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2028\n\nWhat you need to know: The Sweden striker has reached legendary status at Sporting CP thanks to his superb goal scoring. Just 1\u00bd years since joining the club, he has found the net 77 times in 82 appearances (all competitions); throw in 22 assists, and it makes for a remarkable record.\n\nGy\u00f6keres finds space brilliantly, while his finishing leaves little room for dithering or hesitation. He picks his spot and applies an adjusting touch if needed before executing the finish with power and precision. Away from the box, Gy\u00f6keres links up well with his midfielders and full-backs and, when venturing wide, he also has the tricks and burst of pace to beat opponents before attacking the goal with full conviction. Given his reported \u20ac100m release clause (or \u20ac75m valuation), his suitors are almost exclusively in the Premier League. -- Karlsen\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Arsenal's interest in Gy\u00f6keres last summer was lukewarm, with the club focusing more heavily on Sesko, and it is unlikely that they will make a late move this month. Had United been in a position to pay the 26-year-old's release clause in Lisbon, it's likely that a deal would already have been done to reunite him with former Sporting boss Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.\n\nUnited are desperate for a goal threat, and Amorim knows that Gy\u00f6keres is the perfect focal point for his 3-4-2-1 formation. But United don't have the money and there is zero chance of a loan deal, so this is a deal that is likely to have to wait until the summer -- if Amorim is able to ride out the storm at Old Trafford and avoid any prospect of United losing faith in his ability to revive the club. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: United offload Marcus Rashford for a fee (very unlikely) and Alejandro Garnacho for \u20ac60m to then reinvest some of the funds in Gy\u00f6keres, who becomes a modern-day goal-scoring talisman version of Robin van Persie at Old Trafford. -- Ogden\n\nOLLIE WATKINS\n\nAge: 29\n\nClub: Aston Villa\n\nForm this season: 10 goals, seven assists in 30 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac55m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2028\n\nWhat you need to know: Though he has already taken his Premier League account into double figures this season, a sense of frustration has emerged around the England forward. There's the obvious competition from the emerging 21-year-old Jhon Dur\u00e1n to contest Watkins' status as an undisputed regular, and there's an uncharacteristic indecisiveness in crucial moments that has troubled him periodically. While one should not doubt his ability to bounce back -- after all, he has scored 10 goals this season (from an xG of 11.52) and has been one of the most consistent marksmen in the Premier League in recent years -- some signs might indicate that the moment is ripe for a big club to move for him. And with Watkins at 29, it might also be the right time for Villa to offload him. Few would bet against the pacey, persistent and well-balanced centre-forward serving as an instant fix for goal-scoring predicaments elsewhere. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? The chances of Watkins leaving Villa Park this month are practically zero, but his situation is worth monitoring. The England forward made it clear after the recent Premier League draw at Arsenal, when he scored a second-half equaliser, that he has grown frustrated with coach Unai Emery's use of him and reluctance to pair him alongside Dur\u00e1n in a front two. Watkins spoke of his unhappiness at being regularly substituted late in games \"when I score goals,\" so if that continues, he could become a target for clubs in the summer.\n\nWith three years remaining on his contract, Watkins could make a move this summer. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: As with Sesko, Watkins to Arsenal would be a deal that could suit both parties. It might be the Gunners' final piece in the jigsaw puzzle. -- Ogden\n\nTIER 2: Intriguing options, with caveats\n\nJONATHAN DAVID\n\nAge: 25\n\nClub: Lille\n\nForm this season: 18 goals, seven assists in 31 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac45m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2025\n\nWhat you need to know: One of the most productive forwards in Ligue 1 over the past five seasons (with 0.5 goals per game), the Canada international has scored 18 goals this season (eight penalties) and has proved himself in the Champions League, too, with goals against powerhouses such as Juventus, Liverpool and both Madrid sides.\n\nSo why is David still at Lille with merely five months to run on his contract? One likely explanation is that he's an old-school \"second striker\" (or free-roaming forward) rather than a trademark No. 9. That doesn't make him any of a lesser footballer, but it does raise questions among suitors about whether he could genuinely operate as the focal point in attack or whether he'd end up being an inverted winger. With his change of pace, incisive moments, and quick execution technique, however, David could play a pivotal role as a squad player for a bigger club than Lille. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Arsenal and Tottenham have both been linked with David, but his style doesn't quite fit either team. That said, he scores goals and would be relatively inexpensive because his contract at Lille is due to expire at the end of this season. David might want to wait until the summer and exploit his free-agent status, but if a major team make a move before the deadline, it could suit Lille, the player and the interested club, who would be signing him for a knockdown fee. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Liverpool have been the smartest club in recruitment for some time, and a move for David would be in keeping with their astute signings while enabling them to phase out Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Federico Chiesa. -- Ogden\n\nMATHEUS CUNHA\n\nAge: 25\n\nClub: Wolverhampton Wanderers\n\nForm this season: 10 goals, four assists in 22 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac50m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2027\n\nWhat you need to know: Strictly speaking, the Brazil attacker is not an out-and-out centre-forward. Earlier in his career, he featured as an attacking midfielder, a No. 10 or even as an inverted winger on the left. For Wolves, he's thriving slightly tucked in off the left wing, allowing him to commence his runs from the left side for a right-footed finish.\n\nGiven his size, spatial appreciation, elevated ability to set up combinational exchanges and knack for goal scoring, Cunha could tempt you into thinking he's a No. 9 -- or a \"false\" one, at the very least. He has reached double figures in a struggling Wolves side this season and his powerful forward bursts with the ball are extremely valuable for the team especially in the transitional phase. His strong runs often culminate in goal-scoring opportunities or fouls -- he has been fouled 40 times this season, which is in the top five percentile -- in dangerous attacking areas. What's more, Cunha also carries the assertiveness and vibes of a star performer made for a top club. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Wolves know they have growing Premier League interest in signing Cunha from Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa and Arsenal, but sources have told ESPN that the Molineux hierarchy have no intention of offloading the 25-year-old this month. The former Atletico Madrid forward is under contract with Wolves until June 2027, making a move in the summer seem inevitable for a player who has done so well at the club since leaving LaLiga.\n\nWith two Midlands rivals in the race to sign Cunha, and Arsenal hovering in the background, Wolves' determination to hold on to the player might prove to be little more than a bargaining tactic designed to increase his transfer fee. Yet losing their leading scorer while in the middle of a relegation battle could be too much of a risk. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Cunha stays at Wolves, keeps them in the Premier League and seals a big-money move away from Molineux this summer. -- Ogden\n\nJHON DURAN\n\nAge: 21\n\nClub: Aston Villa\n\nForm this season: 12 goals in 28 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac40m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2030\n\nWhat you need to know: Arguably one of the breakout stars of the season, the Colombia international has made such an impact that he now rivals Watkins for the centre-forward role at Aston Villa. Sure, there are still areas to improve; his first touch can let him down (through pure enthusiasm rather than technical deficiency), he often shoots when there's a better option with the pass, mostly only thrives when the game opens up, and is slightly selfish. Yet Duran possesses so much potential that the sky is the limit. His movement is already exceptional, just as his positional appreciation inside the box is of a standard usually associated with more-experienced marksmen.\n\nWhile his frequent shooting (four-plus per 90 minutes) can be a nuisance for his teammates, it's the trait of a genuine goal scorer -- he has the powerful left-footed shot to go with it -- and an edge you don't want to remove from a 21-year-old. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Villa rejected a \u00a357m offer from West Ham to sign the Colombia forward earlier this month, and sources said there is also interest in Duran from Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr. Having signed him from Chicago Fire for just \u00a318m in January 2023, Villa stand to make a huge profit if they sanction a move, but the calculation at Villa Park is based on his age and likely development weighed against the age (29) and transfer value of Watkins.\n\nThe smarter long-term move would be to retain Duran and offload Watkins, but if Al Nassr make a substantial offer, or if West Ham return with a bigger bid at some point, Villa will be facing a deal they cannot refuse. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Stay at Villa and become the club's No. 1 striker over the next 12 months. -- Ogden\n\nJOAO PEDRO\n\nAge: 23\n\nClub: Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nForm this season: Five goals and five assists in 16 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac50m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2028\n\nWhat you need to know: In the general absence of classic No. 9s, the Brighton forward could pose a fascinating alternative for clubs in the market for a versatile, multifaceted attacker. While the Brazil international might not yet be a complete presence in that central position, his finishing skills are developing and his speed, dribbling, creativity and power render him capable of creating chances even without support.\n\nJoao Pedro is also smart without the ball, often dropping deep to create space or help build the attacks from the defensive half. None of this prevents him from pushing into the attacking box. This season, he has averaged 6.5 touches in the opposing penalty area per 90 minutes, which leaves him well inside the top 10 percentile for Premier League forward and he has also set up five goals this campaign. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? This one should be bracketed in the \"nothing to see here\" category. Joao Pedro has done well at Brighton and has prompted the interest of Liverpool, but there is no suggestion the Premier League leaders will make a move during the January window. With youngster Evan Ferguson struggling for form and fitness at the Amex Stadium -- he might yet leave on loan this month -- and Danny Welbeck needing careful rotation given his age (34) and injury history, there is virtually no chance of Brighton offloading Joao Pedro unless they receive a huge fee. And that isn't going to happen. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Stay at Brighton and take the step up to a major club this summer. -- Ogden\n\nTIER 3: Long-shot options with opportunity, risk\n\nDOMINIC CALVERT-LEWIN\n\nAge: 27\n\nClub: Everton\n\nForm this season: Three goals, one assist in 21 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac22m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2025\n\nWhat you need to know: You have to travel back five years to find the then-England centre-forward's heyday. His productivity has undeniably dried up since then, but in his defence, he hasn't always enjoyed abundant supply in a struggling Everton side. Yet, he's a pure No. 9 -- there aren't many out there -- and with an expiring contract, he can speak to foreign clubs as he pleases this month. As he approaches 270 appearances (66 goals) for Everton, Calvert-Lewin is just 27 with plenty of games left in him.\n\nIt's not inconceivable that several top managers are pondering whether they could get his career back on track, even if just as a backup option. His pace is good enough to threaten in behind, he leads the line and presses avidly, he jumps well and attacks the ball well in the air. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Juventus have been watching Calvert-Lewin and considering a move at the end of the season, when he will become a free agent. But there is a chance that Everton could do business this month in order to avoid losing him for nothing in six months' time. The risk for Everton is that they would be without their only proven, if unreliable, goal scorer while they continue to battle against relegation.\n\nIf Everton manager David Moyes was able to find a replacement, Calvert-Lewin could move this month despite his chequered fitness record. Many clubs have looked at him in the not-too-distant past, including Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester United and, if he stays fit, he could be a very good signing for a club in need of goals. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Man United, short on money and goals, could do worse than strike a deal for Calvert-Lewin. He is much better than their existing options and could be a low-budget Gy\u00f6keres for Amorim before United sign the real thing in the summer. -- Ogden\n\nSANTIAGO GIMENEZ\n\nAge: 23\n\nClub: Feyenoord\n\nForm this season: 15 goals and three assists in 18 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac37m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2027\n\nWhat you need to know: The Mexico international has been linked with a move away from Feyenoord practically since the day he arrived from Cruz Azul in summer 2022. There's not a European powerhouse that haven't sent scouts to check him out, but the recurring dilemma has always been around how his goals in the striker-friendly Dutch Eredivisie would translate in a more competitive league. That said, it'd be hard to ask more from Gimenez; he has scored a hat trick away at Ajax, beaten Luis Su\u00e1rez's record for goals in a calendar year (31 in 2023) and scored six goals from eight UEFA Champions League outings (including two against Bayern last week).\n\nMARK OGDEN Read all the latest news and reaction from ESPN FC senior writer Mark Ogden.\n\nLinked with a \u20ac40m move to Milan, the left-footed Gimenez doesn't cover vast areas in the build-up phase but generally comes to life when approaching the attacking box. Most of his goals originate from crosses, cut-backs or short dashing movements behind the opposing centre-backs. A true poacher who plays with high concentration and intensity. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? AC Milan are the most likely club to sign Gimenez this month, but attempts to raise funds by offloading fringe players have so far been unsuccessful and Feyenoord's surprise progress in the Champions League could be enough for the Dutch club to reject an offer for him during this window. Last week's 3-0 win against Bayern Munich in Rotterdam, when Gimenez scored twice, secured a playoff spot for Feyenoord, and they can still jump into the top eight and a guaranteed round-of-16 place if they beat Lille on Matchday 8 this week.\n\nHaving exceeded expectations in the Champions League, Feyenoord have banked more prize money than they would have budgeted for, meaning they can hold off on moving on a player whose contract runs until June 2027. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: Gimenez is making a name for himself in the Champions League, so he should sit tight, keep scoring and seal a bigger move in the summer. -- Ogden\n\nRASMUS HOJLUND\n\nAge: 21\n\nClub: Manchester United\n\nForm this season: Seven goals and one assist in 27 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac60m\n\nContract expires: June 30, 2028\n\nWhat you need to know: Parting ways with Manchester United after just a year-and-a-half, before he has turned 22, would be a major defeat for the club. He was intended as a statement signing -- the Denmark international was said to embody a new, potential-driven transfer policy at Old Trafford akin to Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea -- but an early exit could reduce the odds of him blossoming elsewhere.\n\nAfter a promising enough first season (10 Premier League goals), H\u00f8jlund has looked increasingly dejected at Old Trafford. While the issue of working within a disjointed attack persists, manager Amorim's patience in low-scoring centre-forwards won't last forever. At his best, though, H\u00f8jlund can exhilarate the crowd with his tremendous penetrative power or provide telling contributions for his teammates. Those moments have been few and far between.\n\nAnother challenge for H\u00f8jlund is that he's unable to express his previously fine link-up game as he struggles to get on the ball. And when he does, his service or touch are often sloppy. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Despite signing H\u00f8jlund for an initial \u20ac75m from Atalanta in summer 2023, United are prepared to offload the 21-year-old if they receive a suitable offer, either in this window or at the end of the season. Having struggled to look anything like a Premier League striker at Old Trafford, however, United are facing a big loss if he does move. Interest is limited, but AC Milan and Juventus could both move for the youngster if they fail to land their preferred options.\n\nAlthough his time at United has been relatively unimpressive, H\u00f8jlund's reputation in Italy remains healthy because of the potential he showed at Atalanta. There is also some interest from the German Bundesliga. But heading into the final week of the window, United aren't being overwhelmed by offers. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: A move to Brentford, maybe in exchange for Bryan Mbeumo, could be a creative solution for all parties. H\u00f8jlund could develop away from the Old Trafford spotlight under a top coach in Thomas Frank and Mbeumo, whose contract expires in June 2026, could give United a proven goal scorer. -- Ogden\n\nJOSHUA ZIRKZEE\n\nAge: 23\n\nClub: Manchester United\n\nForm this season: Four goals and three assists in 32 games (all comps)\n\nTransfer value, per Transfermarkt: \u20ac42m\n\nContract expires in: June 30, 2029\n\nWhat you need to know: In theory, the Netherlands international looked an enticing signing for United when he arrived for \u20ac42.5m from Bologna in the summer. Young, and with a positive trajectory, Zirkzee was trying to build on a stellar reputation from Serie A. The reality has turned out differently.\n\nInitially, there was a case for allowing him time to adapt to the frenzied nature of the Premier League. After six months, however, he still struggles when defenders close him down aggressively, often losing the ball, and when dealing with the physicality of holding up possession. As of now, there are few signs that he's getting any nearer the intensity and assertiveness required for a Man United forward.\n\nThough more of a No. 9\u00bd than an outright targetman No. 9, there is a fine, technically gifted footballer in there despite his travails. But as a \"playmaker\" in the final third, it's unlikely Zirkzee will ever become the high-scoring striker that United crave. -- Karlsen\n\nWhich clubs are interested? Zirkzee has been another recruitment failure at United, with sources saying that his move was justified by impressive statistical data for the Serie A team. That data has not translated into reality at Old Trafford, and Zirkzee is now available for transfer.\n\nUnited won't allow both Zirkzee and H\u00f8jlund to leave in the same window, but with the two players attracting interest from the same clubs, it could be a race to the exit door, especially if United are able to sign someone more experienced and reliable. -- Ogden\n\nVideo game solution: The Premier League is too quick for Zirkzee, so his best hope is a move to Germany or back to Italy. -- Ogden",

                "text": "Former Premier League referee David Coote apologised for the actions that led to his sacking last month by England referees' body PGMOL, saying that the pressure of the job and fear of abuse due to his sexuality triggered his behaviour.\n\nCoote was fired after being suspended in November following a video circulating on social media showing the official allegedly abusing Liverpool and their ex-manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\nThe 42-year-old Coote, who officiated more than 100 top-flight games, said a fear of coming out as gay led him to turn to drugs and added that he \"was not sober\" at the time of the video.\n\n\"I want to apologise to anybody who I've offended by my actions. You can tell by the video I wasn't sober,\" Coote told The Sun in an interview released on Monday. \"I have received deeply unpleasant abuse during my career as a ref and to add my sexuality to that would have been really difficult.\n\n\"My sexuality isn't the only reason that led me to be in that position. But I'm not telling an authentic story if I don't say that I'm gay, and that I've had real struggles dealing with hiding that.\n\n\"I hid my emotions as a young ref and I hid my sexuality as well, a good quality as a referee but a terrible quality as a human being.\"\n\nCoote was suspended by PGMOL on Nov. 11 and the controversy escalated a few days later when The Sun released a video allegedly showing him snorting white powder while officiating at Euro 2024, prompting a new UEFA investigation.\n\nHe also officiated at last year's Olympics and said he had been in an \"incredibly dark place\" since the video was published while struggling with pressure due to his workload.\n\n\"In 2023 I lost my mum very suddenly. At the same time my uncle was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. After COVID and the introduction of VAR, six officials were suddenly needed for each game,\" Coote said. \"I don't recognise myself in the cocaine video. I can't resonate with how I felt then, but that was me. I was struggling with the schedule and there was no opportunity to stop. And so I found myself in that position, escaping.\n\n\"I received nothing for it. I'm really disappointed that anything like this has come out because it tarnishes the integrity of the game.\"\n\nThe former referee said he was over his drug habit after having therapy, but still felt shame over his actions.\n\n\"I'm guilty of doing what I did, but I'm trying to be the best person that I can be now. I've taken steps to try and be the best I can be both from a physical and a mental wellbeing,\" Coote said. \"To other people who are in my situation, I'd say seek help and talk to somebody because if you bottle it up like I have done, it has to come out in some way.\"\n\nCoote also cited his own example to show how relentless abuse from the stands and on social media could impact the mental health of officials.\n\n\"Every official that takes to the pitch up and down the country from a local playing field to the Premier League is a human being, not just a referee,\" he said. \"They have feelings. They may not show them, but it will impact them when they're receiving abuse. I've struggled and I've tried to get through it in my own way and made poor decisions in doing so.\"\n\nInformation from Reuters and The Associated Press was used in this story.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAl Hilal announced on Monday that they had reached an agreement with Neymar to terminate his contract and open the door for a return to Santos for the Brazil international.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League club said on social media that the two sides had agreed to mutually part ways and wished Neymar luck in his future.\n\nThat future increasingly looks like it will be in his native Brazil, with ESPN sources saying on Sunday that Neymar would sign a six-month contract with the option of an additional year at Santos, the team with which he came through the youth ranks.\n\nAccording to ESPN Brazil, Neymar is set to sign a contract with Santos in the coming days, and the club plans to unveil him to the fans on Thursday or Friday.\n\nTo facilitate his return, Neymar has agreed to give up a significant portion of his salary from his deal with Al Hilal, which runs through next summer. Sources said he will forfeit between $25 million and $30 million from the $65 million remaining on his contract.\n\nNeymar, 32, endured a difficult spell with Al Hilal after joining the Saudi Arabian club from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2023 for a fee of $97.6 million.\n\nThe former Barcelona star suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty shortly after signing for Al Hilal. He returned to the field last October, but a hamstring injury kept him from making more of a contribution, and manager Jorge Jesus said earlier in January that Neymar was free to pursue other opportunities.\n\nHe made just seven league and cup appearances with just one goal scored in an AFC Champions League group stage match against Nassaji Mazandaran on Oct. 3, 2023.\n\nDespite his struggles in Saudi Arabia, Neymar remains one of the biggest names in the sport thanks to his exploits alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez while with Barcelona from 2013 to 2017. In that time, he was part of sides that won a UEFA Champions League crown, two LaLiga titles and three Copa del Reys.\n\nHe later moved to PSG in 2017 and won five Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups and two French League Cups.\n\nNeymar began his professional career with Santos in 2009, leading them to a Copa Libertadores triumph in 2011, where he scored in the second leg of the final, a 2-1 win over Pe\u00f1arol.\n\nSantos won the Brazilian Serie B title in 2024 and were promoted to the country's top flight for the upcoming season.\n\nAt the international level, Neymar has appeared 128 times for Brazil, scoring a Selecao-record 79 goals. He was part of the Brazil side that won the gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, which Brazil hosted.\n\nInformation from Jeff Carlisle and Julien Laurens was used in this story.",

Sources have told ESPN that Postecoglou is likely to be given the opportunity to win that tie, given they hold a slender 1-0 lead from the first leg, unless there is another dramatic downturn in the intervening two games.\n\nPostecoglou's side host Swedish club IF Elfsborg in the Europa League on Thursday -- with Spurs in a good position to secure automatic qualification for the knockout stages -- before a tricky trip across London to Brentford on Sunday. Just three days after that Carabao Cup second leg match, Spurs face Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nAnge Postecoglou's Tottenham side are languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League table. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nThere continues to be a recognition among the club's hierarchy that Postecoglou is hampered by an unusually bad injury situation with 10 first-team players unavailable against Leicester.\n\nRicharlison was only able to play 54 minutes while Postecoglou suggested after the game that Pape Matar Sarr should not have played at all due to a lack of match fitness.\n\nPostecoglou is hopeful that first-choice centre-backs Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven could return in time in the next week or so while the club are active in the January transfer market and aim to bring in at least one player before next Monday's deadline.\n\nFollowing the loss to Leicester on Sunday, Postecoglou was asked if he would get another fortnight in his post to benefit from key players returning,\n\n\"Who knows? I reckon there is probably a fair chunk [of people] that will say 'no,'\" he said.\n\n\"When you are the manager of a football club you can be very vulnerable and isolated. I don't feel that. I feel like this group of players, not for me, are giving everything for the club. I have a group of staff that is really committed. I focus on that.\"",

He celebrated his debut with a goal straight from a corner kick last weekend.\n\nHis new team said in a statement that they found out about his arrest from media reports.\n\n\"The club respects the presumption of innocence and therefore cannot comment further,\" it said. \"We can only confirm that the player was absent from training this morning.

(1:02)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nManchester United fans have warned the club that they risk \"outright rebellion\" if they introduce further ticket price rises.\n\nSupporters have also told co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that doing anything to worsen the mood among United's fan base would affect the matchday atmosphere at Old Trafford which could send team performances into \"catastrophic tailspin.\"\n\nRatcliffe has already been heavily criticised by fans for the mid-season decision to raise ticket prices to \u00a366 ($82.5). And in an open letter to the 72-year-old British billionaire, supporter group M.U.S.T have issued a warning about the impact of further increases.\n\n\"As you consider forthcoming decisions on match ticketing policies and pricing, we urge you to pause and carefully reflect on the timing, potential consequences, and long-term impact of any major changes,\" M.U.S.T. said in a letter to Ratcliffe.\n\n\"A price increase or significant ticketing policy changes would land very badly with fans at this time. Negative sentiment comes with financial costs, as discontent escalates into active protests and disillusionment.\n\n\"This discontent could lead to outright rebellion, with consequences not just for matchday revenues but also for sponsor relations and the club's global brand.\"\n\nM.U.S.T have warned that provoking further anger among fans could lead to more poor performances in home games.\n\nHead coach Ruben Amorim has already suggested the team are struggling to play at home because of anxiety inside the stadium. United have lost four of their last six home games but were able to secure positive results at Liverpool and Arsenal earlier this month.\n\n\"Fan dissatisfaction affects the matchday atmosphere, creating performance anxiety for players, rather than the vocal support needed to inspire them,\" continued M.U.S.T.\n\n\"A passive or even hostile atmosphere at Old Trafford compounding struggling team performances could spiral into a catastrophic tailspin.\"",

Clive Rose/Getty Images\n\n\"So if things don't change, I will not change. It's the same situation for every player. If you do the maximum, if you do the right things, we can use every player. And you can see it today on the bench, we miss a little bit of pace to go and change the game, move some pieces.\n\n\"But I prefer it like that. I will put Vital on before I put a player on that don't give the maximum every day. So I will not change in that department.\"\n\nAmorim, who arrived from Portuguese champions Sporting CP in November, celebrates his 40th birthday on Monday. But after the Fulham win, he said he feels much older after his brief stint at United.\n\n\"It's not 40 ... I'm 50!\" he said. \"After two months at Manchester United, it's 50. It's a privilege to spend my 40th birthday here. That feeling of winning and three points is really important for us. You cannot see a great improvement in the team and that is a fact, but to win helps us to improve.\n\n\"We've had some lack of luck in some games. Today, was not the best match but we managed to win. The important thing is I have a clear idea of what I want to do. Sometimes I'm frustrated. We want to play a different style and we are going to play a different style in the future.\"",

The Posta journalist claimed he was taking pictures along with other journalists when the 26-year-old became infuriated and hit him outside a nightclub.\n\nDescribing the altercation, per Turkish publication Posta, Bozduman said, \"As soon as the flashes went off, he started shouting and ran at me. He tried to grab my camera, but I held on to it. Then he punched me in the head. The right side of my head is still in pain.\"\n\nOsimhen is also alleged to have offered money to the journalists to delete the pictures, and when his offer was refused, he allegedly issued threats, saying, \"if these images are released, I will ruin you.\"\n\nOsimhen, however denied the allegations, saying the incident happened in front of a restaurant where he and a few friends, including fellow Nigeria international Kenneth Omeruo had gone to have a meal.\n\n\"I was never at a night club,\" he told Turkish journalist Enes Cevahirci. \"Me and my friends went to an African restaurant for dinner. We were done and went outside to look at my friend's brand new car.\n\n\"I was coming back to go into my van and these guys just popped out from nowhere and put a camera in my face. I was shocked. I was asking them what is the problem, why do you pop out the camera in front of my face?\n\n\"They said they are paparazzi. [I said] Okay what do you want? They didn't say anything, just popped the camera in my face. And then my friends went to meet them and said you can't do that. If you're professional, you have to come if you want to ask for (an) interview.\"\n\nThe Nigerian denied hitting the journalist, saying he only asked the journalists to delete the pictures: \"I never punched this guy, I never hit him, I went to him and told him you have to take the picture down, you have to delete it. It's my picture, I have every right to tell him to take it down.\"\n\nNigeria defender Omeruo, who was also present during the altercation, backed up Osimhen's version of events saying, \"Of course he didn't touch him. I was there.\"\n\nOsimhen, who has scored 16 goals so far with five assists for Galatasaray and is one of the most sought after strikers in world football, suggested he will take legal action.\n\nHe said: \"I am not new to this type of thing. I knew they were going to lie and lie and lie. This is a case of violence, and he came out to lie. But of course, it is not going to be an easy one.\n\n\"I don't need to shout, but I will take the necessary steps to make sure. If I hit him, he is going to get justice. If he lied, then he is going to see the wrath of the law.\"",

They should've gone into the break with the lead through Sunil Chhetri, who somehow missed a golden opportunity. He exchanged passes nicely with Alberto Noguera on the edge of the area, and then went through one-on-one with Vishal Kaith but dragged his shot wide of the near-post.\n\nBagan really didn't create that much until the goal, which came out of nothing. A cross from the left wing was cleared to the edge of the penalty area, from where Liston unleashed a sensational volley into the corner, well past the reach of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. Bengaluru could've equalised in stoppage time, but Rahul Bheke's header from point-blank range went just over the bar, as the Bagan faithful heaved a massive sigh of relief, at their team taking another giant stride towards retaining their league shield.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nKylian Mbappe is back.\n\nNot that he had gone anywhere, really. But there had been questions. Coming into Real Madrid's match against Real Valladolid, Mbappe had scored 12 goals in 18 LaLiga games, 18 in 30 across all competitions. These are not bad numbers, but they aren't Real Madrid superstar forward numbers (mostly thanks to one Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo) and this being Madrid, the questions were relentless. Can he really do it, they asked off the World Cup winner... can he handle the pressure of being Madrid's focal point, can he work with the other superstar attackers in the team?\n\nOn the field he'd looked a bit hesitant, caught offside multiple times (most notably in his first Clasico), missed a couple of crunch penalties, and even turned down the chance to take one. Even Mbappe, usually so self-confident, had felt the doubts creep in. Ahead of the Valladolid game, he'd said he felt he was at \"rock bottom\" after the second of those penalty misses (against Athletic in December). \"I believe it was a mentality issue and that was a point I realised that I had to work harder. I was thinking too much about how to do things. Whether to go into space, whether to go to Vini's [Vinicius Jr's] area of the pitch, to Rodrygo's area. When you overthink, you don't focus on your game. I knew I had to do more, that was the time to change the situation.\"\n\nChange the situation he has. Last week he scored a brace against Las Palmas, and said, \"I've adapted to the team now, and I can play as I want.\" This past Saturday night, he played as he wanted and put Valladolid to the sword.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 Lottin pic.twitter.com/dPcwE1EIH0 - Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadrid) January 25, 2025\n\nIt started in the thirtieth minute. Cushioning a hard ping from Fede Valverde to Jude Bellingham, he set off, knowing the return would arrive. Bellingham's immediate 1-2 return deflected off an unwitting Javi Sanchez's leg, but arrive it did at the feet of Mbappe, and he finished with a trademark close-ranger curler into the far post. It was a goal created by Mbappe taking a game from jogging pace to warp speed by dint of his movement. And there was more to come.\n\nFifty-seven minutes in, Madrid raced forward on the counter, Mbappe down the middle, Rodrygo down the left and Bellingham the right. With Rodrygo carrying the ball, Mbappe instantly realised he'd move to cut in and arced his sprint around the Brazilian, on the outside. It sounds simple when we read it, but watch it happen and even in slow mo, the man is a blur. What happened next was even more rapid. Collecting the ball without breaking stride, he took a touch and opened his body up simultaneously, before calmly passing it into the bottom corner. Fast, flowing, decisive... this was Kylian Mbappe doing Kylian Mbappe things.\n\nIn the last minute of regulation time, when Bellingham was hacked down in the box, there were no doubts who would take the pen. No rotation, no deference. Superstar Galactico forwards don't do any of that -- and Mbappe finished with a calm Ronaldo would have been proud of to complete his first hattrick in Madrid colours.\n\nAfter the game, he said all the right things too. \"I'm happy with the hat trick, but I'm more happy with the win,\" he told Real Madrid TV, before sounding a warning to every defence in the land: \"My adaptation is over for sure. I feel good, with my movements, and my teammates, you can see it on the pitch.\"\n\nAnd for that, Kylian Mbappe takes our Moment of the Weekend.",

Arsenal and Manchester United got 1-0 wins while Tottenham's loss to Leicester City compounded their worries.\n\nOver in La Liga, Kylian Mbappe starred for Real Madrid with his first hat-trick in Los Blancos while Barcelona continued their free-flowing goal glut but Atletico Madrid struggled. In Serie A, AC Milan got a dramatic late win as Napoli ended Juventus' unbeaten start with a comeback win. In Bundesliga, Harry Kane scored to extend Bayern Munich's lead.\n\nESPN's By The Numbers brings you the best of stats from weekend's football matches:\n\n176\n\nMohamed Salah (176) has surpassed Thierry Henry (175) for seventh most goals in Premier League history. Since Mohamed Salah joined Liverpool in 2017-18, his Premier League goals are 4th most by any player in the Top 5 European leagues (he scored 2 PL goals with Chelsea prior to joining Liverpool.)\n\n8\n\nManchester United has won 8 straight Premier League games at Fulham (since 2011). That extends the club's longest road winning streak vs any team in PL history.\n\n2\n\nThe match against Chelsea was the second time Manchester City allowed a goal within the first 3 minutes of play in the Premier League this season. They won both games.\n\n249\n\nErling Haaland has scored 249 career club goals in all competitions (114 of those are for Manchester City)\n\n25.4 meters\n\nHaaland scored a 7th career goal from outside the box with Manchester City in all competitions. But this goal vs Chelsea was from a distance of 25.4 meters - his farthest in Premier League.\n\n5\n\nEderson now has five assists in the Premier League, the joint-most by a goalkeeper in the competition's history along with Paul Robinson.\n\n700\n\nDavid Moyes took charge of his 700th game in the Premier League (430 Everton, 34 Manchester United, 38 Sunderland, 198 West Ham United), becoming the third manager to reach that figure in the competition, after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger (828) and Alex Ferguson (810).\n\n18\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly became the first player 18 years or younger to get red carded in a Premier League since Jack Wilshere in 2010.... also with Arsenal.\n\n24\n\nTottenham's 24 points are tied for the club's second fewest through 23 games played in a Premier League season. They are closer to relegation zone (8 points from 18th place) than it is from spots to qualify to European competitions.\n\nSpurs in their last seven PL matches: \u274c Tottenham 1-2 Leicester City\n\n\u274c Everton 3-2 Tottenham\n\n\u274c Arsenal 2-1 Tottenham\n\n\u274c Tottenham 1-2 Newcastle\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Tottenham 2-2 Wolves\n\n\u274c Nottingham Forest 1-0 Tottenham\n\n\u274c Tottenham 3-6 Liverpool What is going on in North London? \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/ELSjMg2B8X - ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) January 26, 2025\n\n7\n\nLeicester City snapped a 7-game losing streak in the Premier League, which was the longest active streak by any team from the Top 5 European leagues.\n\n198\n\nJamie Vardy reached 198 career goals with Leicester City in all competitions. The only players in club history with 200+ goals are Arthur Chandler (273) and Arthur Rowley (265)\n\n36\n\nBryan Mbeumo (36) is 1 goal away from tying Toane Wissa (37) as Brentford's all-time scorer in the Premier League.\n\n47\n\nAlexander Isak tied Callum Wilson (47) as Newcastle's second best scorer in Premier League history. Only Alan Shearer (148) has more (Shearer is also the PL's all-time scorer with 260 goals)\n\n5\n\nBournemouth scored 5 goals in a Premier League match for the first time since 2019 (5-0 win over Brighton)\n\n1\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored his first hat trick with Real Madrid, scoring all three goals against Real Valladolid.\n\n32\n\nMbappe's first hat-trick came in 32nd game with Real Madrid. He is the first player to score a La Liga hat trick in his first season with Real Madrid since Gareth Bale in 2013-14. Back then, the Welshman did it in his 9th game with Real Madrid.\n\n20\n\nThis was Mbappe's 20th career hat-trick with club and country and his first since March 17, 2024 vs Montpellier in Ligue 1 when playing for PSG.\n\nKYLIAN MBAPP\u00c9 CONVERTS FROM THE SPOT TO SCORE HIS FIRST HAT TRICK FOR REAL MADRID \ud83c\udfa9 pic.twitter.com/KeIu6BX2Gj - ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) January 25, 2025\n\n3\n\nMbappe now has 3 multi-goal games in La Liga this season, tied with Raphinha for second most games with 2+ goals.

He has 41 goal contributions in all competitions since the start of last season, most in the club.\n\n1\n\nThe win over Parma is the first time in Milan's Serie A history that the club has overturned an injury-time deficit with 2 goals.\n\n112\n\nLautaro Mart\u00ednez has 112 career Serie A goals to his name, breaking a tie with Mauro Icardi for second most by a non-Italian for Inter Milan.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPostecoglou is facing immense pressure after another difficult defeat for Tottenham as they endure their worst-ever Premier League run. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nAnother topsy-turvy weekend of European football is in the books, and there are talking points galore across the big leagues.\n\nIn the Premier League, Tottenham's latest defeat piles more pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester City shrugged off an early deficit to Chelsea -- and shaky debut for Abdukodir Khusanov -- to pick up a 3-1 win and get back into the top four.\n\nIn LaLiga, Real Madrid took control of the title race as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored an impressive hat trick to beat Real Valladolid, though Barcelona thrashed Valencia to remain in contention. Elsewhere, there were talking points for Borussia Dortmund and their caretaker manager, AS Monaco, AC Milan and Juventus.\n\nLuis Miguel Echegaray, Sam Marsden and Constantin Eckner take a look at what you might have missed this weekend.\n\nTop takeaway: Postecoglou's future in doubt as Tottenham endure worst-ever Premier League run\n\nOn Sunday, Tottenham Hotspur lost 2-1 to Leicester City, a result that moved the Foxes out of the relegation zone. For Spurs and Ange Postecoglou, however, the numbers are not good. Spurs have now recorded their 13th loss of the season -- as many as Ipswich Town -- which also marked their fourth straight in the league. They haven't earned a league victory since Dec. 15 and are 15th in the table, only eight points from the relegation zone.\n\nA counterargument could highlight the fact that key injuries are impacting their ability to execute their style of play. Another angle could be the available players and how they should shoulder the responsibility. But these are one-dimensional excuses because this is a situation where, sadly, the main focal point is the manager's stubborn approach and how it's costing the team's physical and mental stamina. For a while now, Spurs have looked very tired and when you have a diminished squad, it is the role of the manager to be more pragmatic and alter the style of play. That's not happening under their Greek-Australian manager.\n\nI still think he's a good coach with good ideas and the Carabao Cup run could be their only saving grace, but if this rut continues, the club's executive chairman and decision-maker, Daniel Levy, will have a lot to think about.\n\nBest match: Manchester City 3, Chelsea 1\n\nPart of the reason this game earned my vote was its erratic nature as well as the introduction of two league newcomers.\n\nPep Guardiola opted to start two of his three new signings -- defender Abdukodir Khusanov and forward Omar Marmoush -- and both delivered headlines for varying reasons. The 20-year-old Khusanov, who doesn't speak English and had only two training sessions leading up the game, made a huge mistake that resulted in Chelsea's opener. Then he received an early yellow card after a foul on Cole Palmer. Only Jonathan Woodgate's debut with Real Madrid (an own goal and a red card) was looking worse for a centre-back, but as the game developed, the Uzbekistan defender grew into it.\n\nMarmoush, however, was a beautiful revelation for the Premier League. His pace, aggression and ability to make dangerous runs will add another dimension to a City side that's returning to form. To add more erratic themes, Chelsea's goalkeeper Robert S\u00e1nchez wins the lot after his terrible decision to come off his line, allowing Erling Haaland to score and make it 2-1 before Phil Foden netted the third in the 87th minute.\n\nplay 1:28 Did Cole Palmer go missing for Chelsea in their loss vs. Man City? Luis Miguel Echegaray reacts to Chelsea's 3-1 loss to Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nNewcastle United returned to winning ways on Saturday thanks to a 3-1 win over Southampton with Isak scoring a brace in the space of four minutes. It was another trademark weekend by the Swedish international, who at this point is possibly winning the argument for currently the best striker in Europe. The first was a penalty, but the second? A wonderful ball from Jacob Murphy, which split the defensive line and found Isak, who beautifully controlled the ball before putting it past Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The movement, the placement -- all of it was world class.\n\nOur colleague and former Man City defender Nedum Onuoha mentioned this weekend on BBC Sport that Isak brings reminiscences of Thierry Henry, and I have to tell you, I don't disagree.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Riccardo Calafiori, Arsenal\n\nThere's an argument for Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara following his second-half hat-trick in Bournemouth's 5-0 rout of Nottingham Forest, but my vote goes to the Italian defender who entered the game in the second half to help the Gunners earn three very valuable points.\n\nCalafiori's winner against Wolves served as inspiration in a game that saw Arsenal had to fight hard with 10 men after Myles Lewis-Skelly's red card due to \"serious foul play,\" but it also delivered the most important takeaway: Calafiori's goal keeps Arsenal's title hopes alive. -- Echegaray\n\nplay 2:18 Did Arsenal keep their title hopes alive with late win vs. Wolves? Luis Miguel Echegaray reacts to Arsenal's 1-0 win over Wolves in the Premier League.\n\nTop takeaway: Real Madrid have daylight at the top of LaLiga\n\nThere has been heat on Real Madrid this season -- at times fairly, as they have failed to deliver in big games -- yet this weekend saw them open up a four-point lead at the top of LaLiga. Carlo Ancelotti's side took full advantage of second-placed Atl\u00e9tico Madrid being held to a 1-1 draw by Villarreal as they dispatched Real Valladolid with little fuss, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 netting three in a routine 3-0 win.\n\nAncelotti points out there is still a long way to go (17 games, to be exact) but it's going to be tough for the chasing pack to catch Madrid given this is supposedly them out of form. Their latest win came without Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, too, who was suspended, but with Mbapp\u00e9 in increasingly devastating form. At the moment, despite injuries in defence and doubts about a Toni Kroos-less midfielder, that is enough.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico, though, will be kicking themselves. After winning eight games in a row to climb to the top of the table, they are now without a win in two. The pending Madrid derby on Feb. 8 at the Bernab\u00e9u is not quite make-or-break, but it looks like a game Diego Simeone's side can afford to lose in the scheme of the title race.\n\nMbappe notched his first LaLiga hat trick as Madrid won big at Valladolid. Cesar Ortiz Gonzalez/Soccrates/Getty Images\n\nBest match: Barcelona thrash Valencia\n\nBar\u00e7a showed they cannot be written out of the race yet, however, with a sensational first-half display against Valencia on Sunday. They scored five goals in the opening 45 minutes on their way to a 7-1 win that keeps them within seven points of Madrid.\n\nRaphinha and Lamine Yamal were once again good, but coach Hansi Flick will have been happy with the performances from Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez and Frenkie de Jong, two players who have struggled for minutes this season. Ferm\u00edn, in particular, was impressive, scoring twice and creating two more goals.\n\nBad\u00e9 was the goodie this weekend as he rescued a point for Sevilla against Espanyol with a brilliant curling effort from 25 yards. What made the defender's goal even more memorable was that it came after he'd just had a goal cruelly ruled out and had been battling back days of transfer links to Aston Villa. He celebrated by sliding into the corner and kissing the Sevilla badge.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Real Madrid\n\nThe Frenchman says he has finally adapted to his new surroundings following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain and the evidence backs him up. He netted a hat trick in the win over Valladolid, his first for Madrid, and he has now scored eight times in his past five appearances in all competitions.\n\nHis first two finishes were typical Mbapp\u00e9, shaping in from the left and finishing with the inside of his right foot. His third came late on from the penalty spot, and was his 15th in LaLiga this season. He is now just two behind the league's top scorer, Robert Lewandowski. -- Marsden\n\nTop takeaway: No win for Dortmund under caretaker manager Tullberg\n\nDortmund assigned Mike Tullberg, usually the Under-19s head coach, to manage the team against Werder Bremen following Nuri \u015eahin's dismissal last Wednesday. The 39-year-old Dane demanded the same kind of grit and hardnosed mentality he himself showed as a player. \"I always slogged away ad nauseam, was never the best on the ball. It was all willpower in my case,\" Tullberg said before the game.\n\nGAB & JULS PODCAST Gabriele Marcotti and Julien Laurens dive into the latest news and gossip, analyze matches with special guests, and give their perspective on the world of football. Stream now\n\nWhile we have witnessed the caretaker manager bump time and time again, with teams generally looking reenergized after a change in the dugout, it did not work out quite like that for Dortmund. In front of a passionate and nervous crowd inside Signal Iduna Park, the similarities to previous outings were striking, with Dortmund having loads of ball possession while looking vulnerable against counterattacks. One fast-paced attack by Bremen caused Nico Schlotterbeck to attempt an unwise last-man tackle, the veteran defender getting a red card barely 20 minutes in.\n\nFascinatingly, Dortmund did not change their strategy much despite being one man down, scoring twice before making familiar errors that ultimately cost them two points. Bremen staged a comeback thanks to Leonardo Bittencourt and Dortmund native Marvin Ducksch, as both teams played to a draw.\n\nSurely, Dortmund's courageous display following Schlotterbeck's dismissal can create hope that there is life in this team. But mentality and willpower are not enough if the Schwarzgelben commit a number of mistakes in almost every game. Whoever is hired as \u015eahin's successor will have their hands full.\n\nThe most high-profile game of the matchday was the clash between fifth-placed RB Leipzig and second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Even though Leipzig were coming off their first win in the UEFA Champions League this season and should have felt confident, they were barely able to contain Leverkusen's transcendent playmaker Florian Wirtz during the first half. The Leverkusen playmaker scored the first goal after a beautiful dribble and he set up Aleix Garc\u00eda to score the 2-0, which marked Garc\u00eda's maiden goal for Leverkusen. However, Leipzig fought their way back into the game and were able to snatch points away from Leverkusen.\n\nInterestingly, the match had almost the identical dynamic as their encounter on matchday two, when Leipzig beat Leverkusen 3-2 to end the unbeaten streak for Xabi Alonso & Co. in exciting fashion.\n\nBest goal: Leonardo Bittencourt, Werder Bremen vs. Dortmund\n\nAs mentioned above, Bremen managed to get back into the game at Signal Iduna Park despite being down 2-0 at the hour mark. In the lead-up to Bremen's first goal, Julian Ryerson headed the ball in front of Milo\u0161 Veljkovi\u0107 from a high cross, with Veljkovi\u0107 immediately passing it on to Bittencourt, whose shot from 23 yards out hit the top left corner of the goal. The Bundesliga measured the speed of Bittencourt's strike at 62 mph.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Florian Wirtz\n\nWhile Wirtz was unable to secure the win for Leverkusen at Leipzig, he once again stole the show. He could be awarded the MVP laurels this weekend for the way he fooled both Willi Orb\u00e1n and Arthur Vermeeren before scoring the go-ahead goal alone. -- Eckner\n\nWhat else you missed this weekend\n\nAC Milan, Pulisic, Musah deliver in fantastic comeback win\n\nOn Sunday, new arrival Kyle Walker watched in the stands as AC Milan and American duo Christian Pulisic and Yunus Musah produced a wonderful comeback to beat Parma 3-2 at the San Siro. Parma led twice thanks to Matteo Cancellieri and Enrico Del Prato's goals, which were sandwiched between Pulisic's penalty. The visitors seemed as if they were about to do the league double over Milan, but in stoppage time, magic happened.\n\nTijjani Reijnders received Musah's ball to make it 2-2, with Samuel Chukwueze earning the winner in the fifth minute of added time. There was a long check for offside but once the goal was confirmed, the stadium erupted. It was a big win for Milan and S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, as they try to keep up in the battle for European places. -- Echegaray\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nJuve's invincible dream over\n\nSticking in Italy, Napoli ended Juventus' unbeaten start to the Serie A season, sparing us what might well have been Europe's worst invincible campaign. Frank Anguissa and Romelu Lukaku's second-half goals helped Antonio Conte's side come from behind to reaffirm their place at the top of the table, after Randal Kolo Muani had given Juve the lead on his debut. Incredibly, considering they are a staggering 16 points off the pace, it was the Old Lady's first league defeat of the campaign, but they've won just eight of their 22 Serie A games, drawing 13, and slumped to fifth following this weekend's loss. -- Marsden\n\nPanic stations at Benfica?\n\nIt has not been a great month for Benfica, who suffered their third defeat in four league games with a surprise 3-1 defeat to Casa Pia this weekend. They are now seven points behind leaders Sporting CP. Throw in the midweek 5-4 loss to Barcelona -- a game they led 3-1 and 4-2 -- in the Champions League and the pressure is on when they travel to Juventus on Wednesday, attempting to book their place in the knockout round of the competition. -- Marsden\n\nAS Monaco end weeks of misery\n\nThe winter months have not been nice to Monaco. Following their win over Toulouse in early December, Monaco stumbled from one disappointing result to the next ... until this week. First, Adi H\u00fctter's side beat Aston Villa in the UEFA Champions League thanks to a Wilfried Singo header, improving its chances of qualifying for the first knockout round. Then, it beat Rennes 3-2 in a real shootout on Saturday.\n\nH\u00fctter, who recently extended his contract until 2027 despite the recent slump, must feel some relief. With 30 points after 16 matchdays, Monaco had an identical record as last season. But it seemed as if H\u00fctter's team could not maintain its level of performance this time around. Perhaps the two recent wins mark a turnaround.\n\nParis Saint-Germain might already be too far ahead in the Ligue 1 standings, but finishing second once again would still count as a success for the Austrian manager. -- Eckner",
