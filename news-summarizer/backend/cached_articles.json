                "text": "Miami Beach, Florida AP \u2014\n\nMiami Beach broke up with spring break last year and city leaders still aren\u2019t interested in couples counseling.\n\nOfficials recently announced they were bringing back enhanced security measures for practically the entire month of March, including parking restrictions and increased fees for nonresidents.\n\nThe new rules were introduced last year after three consecutive years of spring break violence. The city is again warning visitors to expect curfews, bag searches at the beach, early beach closures, DUI checkpoints and arrests for drug possession and violence.\n\n\u201cLast year\u2019s spring break was a success on any level you measure it,\u201d Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner said. \u201cWe had zero fatalities, zero shootings, zero stampedes. The majority of our businesses did very well and actually thanked us for the measures we took.\u201d\n\nMost spring break activity centers around a 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for its Art Deco hotels, restaurants and nightclubs. Before spring break last year, city officials launched a marketing campaign that said, \u201cMiami Beach Is Breaking Up With Spring Break.\u201d A video featured residents \u201cbreaking up\u201d with spring breakers and warning them to expect restrictions if they decided to come anyway.\n\nThis year, officials followed up with a \u201cReality Check\u201d video featuring a group of young people on a fictitious reality show having their spring break ruined by the city\u2019s enhanced rules.\n\n\u201cWe broke up a spring break,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cSome people ask, are you getting back together? No, we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nCity leaders want visitors to come and enjoy the beaches, hotels and restaurants, as long as they behave, Meiner said, noting that overall hotel occupancy actually increased in 2024 over 2023.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s because when you walked around Ocean Drive and South Beach, you felt welcoming, you felt safe,\u201d Meiner said.\n\nOther Florida cities struggle with spring break crowds\n\nMiami Beach isn\u2019t the only Florida city bracing for spring breakers this year. Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa are among the top 10 domestic spring break destinations, according to AAA booking data.\n\nFollowing a particularly rowdy Presidents Day weekend in Daytona Beach, Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood recently announced plans to crack down on bad behavior from spring breakers.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t bring any financial benefit,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cAll they do is bring chaos, and if they want to bring chaos, I am going to bring chaos in return.\u201d\n\nBusinesses have mixed reactions\n\nSome Miami Beach business owners see the restrictions as necessary to ensure public safety, while others are concerned that driving away spring breakers could irreparably damage Miami Beach\u2019s status as an iconic tourist destination.\n\nLouis Taic, owner of the Z Ocean Hotel, said he welcomes visitors to Miami Beach any time of the year, but he understands why city officials have taken to actions that they have.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t like is people that take advantage of Miami Beach, that take advantage by doing things here that they would never do at home,\u201d Taic said.\n\nDavid Wallack, owner of Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe, said Miami Beach has thrived as an entertainment destination for nearly a century, even through Prohibition and the Great Depression.\n\nInstead of trying to scare people away, city officials need to organize events such as concerts, art festivals and sporting events to attract people who will spend money, Wallack said.\n\n\u201cMiami Beach is magical, but you\u2019ve got to still give customers what they want,\u201d Wallack said.\n\nAre restrictions linked to race?\n\nSome civil rights advocates believe the restrictions are racially motivated.\n\nSouth Beach became popular among Black tourists about two decades ago as promoters organized Urban Beach Week during the Memorial Day weekend. Many locals have complained about violence and other crime associated with the event, which led to an increased police presence. But the event\u2019s continued popularity correlates to a bump in Black tourism throughout the year.\n\nStephen Hunter Johnson, an attorney and member of Miami-Dade\u2019s Black Affairs Advisory Board, said city leaders are using a brief spike in violence as an excuse to discourage Black visitors.\n\nMost of the problems experienced by Miami Beach in recent years began during the pandemic, when Florida remained open while other popular tourist destinations around the U.S. were locked down, and officials are unfairly crediting the new spring break restrictions with decreasing violence last year, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cArrests were down, and no one was shot,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThose things were going to occur anyway, because the farther we get away from COVID restrictions, the more normalized things are.\u201d\n\nMeiner has repeatedly rejected the notion that the restrictions are racially motivated. He always hates the idea of anyone getting injured, but as an elected official he feels an additional sense of responsibility when people are shot and killed in the city he serves, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep people safe,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cLaw and order is the number one priority in our city. There is no compromising on that.\u201d",

Residents who had evacuated were allowed to re-enter the neighborhood as of Sunday evening.\n\nA smaller fire nearby on Blackthorn Drive was around 80% contained as of around 3 p.m. ET Sunday, the South Carolina Forestry Commission told CNN.\n\nOfficials issued a statewide burn ban Saturday as dozens of wildfires flared across the state \u2013 many of which have since been contained.\n\nThe fire threat continues for the region Sunday, including near Wilmington, North Carolina, and Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Sunday to support wildfire efforts across the state.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office said more than 175 wildfires were burning across 4,200 acres across the state, citing information from the state fire marshal.\n\nIn western North Carolina, near the towns of Tryon and Saluda, a brush fire caused by a power line that fell along US Highway 176 Saturday afternoon spread quickly up a nearby mountain and threatened several structures, Saluda Fire and Rescue said in a post that night.\n\nBy Sunday evening, the fire had burned over 500 acres and was 30% contained, according to Polk County Emergency Management. Several fire departments were responding to the blaze, Polk County officials said.\n\nSome residents near the highway were ordered to evacuate Saturday afternoon by Tryon authorities.\n\n\u201cResidents can expect a heavy fire department presence in the Bear Creek, Hanging Rock, Rhododendron Dr., Oceanview Dr., and Meadow Lark Dr. areas as crews work to protect homes and reduce fire fuels,\u201d Saluda Fire and Rescue said.\n\nA passenger aboard a flight into Myrtle Beach on Saturday night captured video of a mass of smoke and fire billowing up into the sky from the plane window.\n\n\u201cIt was quite terrifying to fly home to,\u201d the passenger, Becca Ann, told CNN.\n\nTwo wildfires burn in Buncombe County, North Carolina, on Saturday. WLOS\n\nTryon and Saluda are just north of the North Carolina-South Carolina border, around 25 miles southeast of Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nFire crews were sent to contain a large wooded fire near Myrtle Beach Saturday night, fire officials said, while residents in several homes in the nearby Carolina Forest area were ordered to evacuate.\n\nDespite weaker winds and cooler temperatures Sunday, dry air combined with dry vegetation due to lack of recent rainfall are keeping the wildfire danger high across the Carolinas and northeast Georgia.\n\nWinds in the area are expected to significantly diminish overnight, and temperatures will approach freezing by Monday morning.\n\nLighter winds will continue through Tuesday as temperatures warm to close to 60 degrees and more humid air returns to the region.\n\nTypically, South Carolina faces around 5,000 wildfires a year, burning almost 30,000 acres, according to the state Emergency Management Division. Similarly, North Carolina saw 4,588 wildfires in 2024, which burned over 15,000 acres.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn a bid to make a political comeback, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is running for mayor of New York City.\n\nCuomo made a 17-minute pitch for his candidacy in a video announcement released on his website, looking directly into the camera as images of New York City played along.\n\n\u201cWe know that today our New York City is in trouble,\u201d Cuomo says as the video shows images of homeless people on city streets and the city\u2019s subways. \u201cYou see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control and in crisis.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s entrance into the already crowded race sets up a potential political comeback for the former governor, who resigned from office in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal after 11 women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nCuomo has denied the allegations, which at the time were outlined in a report by the state attorney general.\n\nThe entrance also sets up a clash between the former governor and current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has been facing renewed scrutiny and calls to step aside after the Trump-led Department of Justice directed prosecutors to drop corruption charges against him.\n\nAdams has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and his campaign did not return a request for comment\n\nCuomo has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving office.\n\nCNN previously reported Cuomo and his aides have been laying the groundwork for a run for months, encouraged by the controversy surrounding Adams.\n\nSigns Cuomo was working to set up a run increased in recent days. Last week, allies for Cuomo launched a super PAC under the name \u201cFix the City,\u201d according to State Board of Elections data.\n\nOpposition quick to respond\n\nCuomo\u2019s competitors reacted to the former governor\u2019s announcement on Saturday.\n\nThere are at least eight candidates already in the race and lawmakers who do not want him back in office have been working behind the scenes to draft additional candidates to fend off Cuomo\u2019s candidacy.\n\nNew York City Comptroller Brad Lander said Cuomo\u2019s candidacy is the \u201clast thing New Yorkers need right now is another agent of chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest city in the world deserves better than this,\u201d said Lander, who has declared himself a mayoral candidate.\n\nScott Stringer, a mayoral candidate who also ran for mayor in 2021, released a video response to Cuomo\u2019s announcement Saturday, saying the former governor has, \u201calways put his ego and his interest ahead of our city.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing mayor of New York may help Andrew Cuomo, but it don\u2019t do a damn thing for New Yorkers,\u201d Stringer said in the video.\n\nNew York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo has been working to draft City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams into the race, according to two sources familiar with her thinking.\n\nAdrienne Adams, who has not officially announced a plan to run, opened a campaign committee account last week, in the latest sign she is taking a serious look at adding her name into the race.\n\nCuomo hit the campaign trail shortly after his video announcement, making a stop at 32BJ SEIU union headquarters in Manhattan, where he attended a candidate screening, followed by a stop for lunch at a Dominican restaurant in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx.\n\nVideo posted on social media shows Cuomo shaking hands among diners as he makes his way around the restaurant.\n\nCampaign can leverage Cuomo\u2019s many years in office\n\nCuomo, the scion of a New York political dynasty, spent decades in government before his stunning 2021 fall from grace.\n\nFresh off a job as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary, he launched a 2002 bid for governor against Carl McCall, who was state comptroller at the time and on track to become New York\u2019s first Black governor. After a series of missteps and a racially charged race that alienated the city\u2019s Black Democratic leaders, Cuomo, who had never held public office before, was forced to bow out of the contest in what he has described as one of the worst moments in his life.\n\nYears later, Cuomo successfully ran for New York attorney general in 2006, followed by a successful run for governor in 2010.\n\nCuomo rose to national prominence at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with daily televised briefings about how the virus was spreading across the state quickly becoming must-watch television for millions of Americans quarantining at home.\n\nBut as the pandemic progressed, killing hundreds of thousands of people around the world, Cuomo\u2019s response also faced intense scrutiny over a controversial directive to transfer recovering Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes. His administration was accused of manipulating data and death toll numbers to cover up the impact the nursing home decision had on thousands of people.\n\nAccusations of sexual harassment against Cuomo began to emerge in December 2020, including from Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former executive assistant and health policy adviser who said Cuomo asked her questions about her sex life while inside his office in the State Capitol. Bennett also said Cuomo told her he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.\n\nLindsey Boylan, another former aide, also alleged in 2018 Cuomo kissed her on the lips following a one-on-one briefing in his New York office.\n\nCuomo denied the allegations and apologized at the time for making comments he said had been misinterpreted.\n\n\u201cI never touched anyone inappropriately,\u201d Cuomo said in his first public remarks addressing the scandal. \u201cI never knew at the time that I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBoylan said Saturday \u201cNew York City deserves better,\u201d according to a piece in Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cAs frustrated as city residents rightfully are about the behavior of its scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, it can indeed get worse,\u201d Boylan wrote.\n\nFormer New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks at the New York City District Council of Carpenters while campaigning for mayor of New York City on Sunday, March 2, 2025. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nRun for mayor marks new chapter\n\nCuomo\u2019s comeback has been in the making for months.\n\nA person familiar with Cuomo\u2019s recent thinking said the campaign will not be \u201can apology tour.\u201d Instead, Cuomo believes he has something to offer the city in this moment \u2013 as concerns over quality of life issues, public safety and affordability are at the top of voters\u2019 minds. Having President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, back in the White House also provides Cuomo an easy and familiar foil to rail against, this time from City Hall.\n\nCuomo might have enough legal reasons to believe he no longer needs to apologize.\n\nHe has notched a couple of recent victories that will allow him to set up a redemption narrative. While opponents are certain to point out his record and the scandals that plagued him, Cuomo can point to the recently dropped lawsuit by his accuser Bennett, who dropped the suit last December, shortly after she was set to be deposed in the case.\n\nBennett accused Cuomo of weaponizing her own lawsuit against her and harassing her friends and family in the process.\n\n\u201cThroughout this extraordinarily painful two-year case, I\u2019ve many times believed that I\u2019d be better off dead than endure more of his litigation abuse, which has caused extraordinary pain and expense to my family and friends,\u201d Bennett said in a statement at the time. \u201cI desperately need to live my life. That\u2019s the choice I am making today.\u201d\n\nCuomo followed by immediately announcing his intent to file a new lawsuit, accusing Bennett of defamation.\n\nSo far, Cuomo is relying on a handful of veteran aides and members of a tight-knit inner circle, sources familiar with the planning tell CNN, including Melissa DeRosa who served as secretary to the governor until just before his resignation, and Richard Azzopardi, Cuomo\u2019s longtime chief spokesperson.\n\nCuomo has also been seeking advice from a network of seasoned campaign operatives \u2013 including Tusk Strategies CEO Chris Coffey and Steven Cohen, Cuomo\u2019s former chief of staff in the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nFor months now, a likely Cuomo candidacy has loomed over the race. Now that he is officially in the running, he has nearly $8 million sitting in his campaign war chest he could use although there are rules about how he\u2019s allowed to use the money.\n\nThe money could give him a significant edge with just four months to go until the primary election.\n\nCuomo, who has near universal name recognition not just in the city but across the state has remained out of the public eye since 2021.\n\nThe campaign video is a reintroduction of sorts for the former governor, who pitches himself as an experienced manager focused on public safety as he looks directly into the camera, delivering his campaign message as images of New York City play along. Cuomo casts himself as a moderate Democrat with the skills and record to respond to a city he says is in the midst of a crisis.\n\n\u201cWe know that today our New York City is in trouble. You feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you\u2019re walking down into the subway,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cYou see it in the empty storefronts, the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence \u2013 the city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.\u201d\n\nWhile he does not mention Adams by name, Cuomo blames \u201cfailed Democratic leadership\u201d and a \u201clack of intelligent action\u201d by the city\u2019s political leaders in a clear shot at the current administration.\n\nIn his video, Cuomo proposes increasing the number of police officers in the NYPD and deploying them into the subway system, transforming the city\u2019s public housing stock and ending the \u201cchaos of e-bikes\u201d on city streets.\n\nWhile he has never run for mayor of New York, Cuomo is familiar with the cutthroat local politics needed to secure a winning coalition \u2013 it requires the city\u2019s Black and Latino voters, union members and White ethnic New Yorkers who tend to lean more moderate despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans in party affiliation.\n\nWhile New York City remains overwhelmingly blue, the city did get a little bit more Republican following Trump\u2019s election, a sign voters are disenchanted with the progressive politics that have dominated the five boroughs for the past decade and they are willing to embrace a more conservative candidate.\n\nIn his video, Cuomo mentions Trump by name but does not criticize him, emphasizing his willingness to work with the federal administration.\n\n\u201cI have worked with President Trump in many different situations and I hope President Trump remembers his hometown, and works with us to make it better,\u201d Cuomo says.\n\nWhile Cuomo highlights his experience in office, a lot has changed in the city\u2019s political landscape since the former governor left office \u2013 his opponents are ready to pounce on his record and remind voters of his scandals, the city\u2019s relatively new ranked choice voting rules adds challenges for candidates and he will be facing the most competitive election in decades.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nGene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, shared a peaceful and private life, rich in adventure, art and genuine love, before their unexpected deaths, their friends fondly remember.\n\nTheir close, longtime friends, Daniel and Barbara Lenihan said the couple, who was found dead Wednesday in their New Mexico home, had chosen to live in a quiet area, tucked away inside a home they built atop 12 acres of land up in the mountains just outside of Santa Fe.\n\n\u201cThey were very private, and we certainly respected that,\u201d Barbara told CNN, adding that Arakawa rarely used cell phones and would usually communicate by email.\n\n\u201cThey were really by themselves, which is the way they wanted it.\u201d\n\nThe two couples met over 30 years ago when Hackman and Arakawa were visiting Santa Fe and stopped by a diving shop, where Hackman saw a drawing of the USS Arizona and Pearl Harbor that Daniel, an underwater archaeologist, had mapped. Hackman wanted to meet Daniel, so the four of them went to lunch together and immediately hit it off, \u201cand it was history from there,\u201d Barbara said.\n\nShe and Arakawa co-founded Pandora\u2019s, a home decor and furnishing store in Santa Fe featuring fabrics from all over the world, as well as the work of local artisans. The two girlfriends were inspired to launch the business after Hackman returned from central Europe where he was filming a movie in 2001 and brought back \u201cbeautiful linen pillows,\u201d Barbara said.\n\nShe had last seen Arakawa three weeks ago at Pandora\u2019s, but said the couple did not come to town very often.\n\n\u201cThey were very, fairly isolated, when you look at the pictures of the woods and their home, so that was not unusual at all to have not heard (from them),\u201d Barbara said.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t leaving much. Betsy was a wonderful wife. They were very close, and she was a good cook and really, really took good care of him,\u201d Barbara added. \u201cThey ate very well. He had had a triple bypass, maybe around (age) 60, and he\u2019d been in really good health since then, and I\u2019m sure she was one of those factors.\u201d\n\nUntil a year ago, Hackman was still riding his bicycle and Arakawa \u201chad him doing yoga and different things at home on Zoom and trying to stay very fit,\u201d Barbara said.\n\nWhen the pair would host the Lenihans at their home, Hackman would often ask Arakawa to play classical pieces on the piano, and she was equally supportive of his accomplishments, Barbara said. They loved to travel and were well-liked in their community, she added.\n\nGene Hackman, right, and his longtime friend, Daniel Lenihan, pictured in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1999. Sarah Martone/Associated Press\n\nDaniel, who wrote three books with Hackman over a period of around 10 years, said he\u2019ll remember him as an \u201cinteresting, funny, very intelligent man,\u201d while Barbara described Arakawa as \u201cclever and witty and fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very stunned, and we have no idea what happened, but there were never any issues between them,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cOur son was saying today, he\u2019s maybe never seen such a compatible couple.\u201d\n\nSanta Fe community honors couple\n\nThe legendary actor, his wife and their dog were found dead in circumstances officials deemed \u201csuspicious enough\u201d to warrant thorough investigation. The couple\u2019s bodies were found in separate rooms in their Santa Fe house, with scattered pills found next to Arakawa, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nData from Hackman\u2019s pacemaker shows he was likely dead for nine days before he and his wife were found dead at their New Mexico home, authorities said.\n\nHackman, 95, was an Oscar-winning actor known for his roles in films such as \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers, \u201cUnforgiven\u201d and \u201cThe Firm.\u201d Arakawa, three decades Hackman\u2019s junior, was a classical pianist.\n\nThe causes of death are not yet known. The pair did not show any external trauma, and there were no immediate signs of foul play, according to preliminary autopsies and officials. There were also no immediate signs of a carbon monoxide or natural gas leak, authorities said.\n\nThe home where the couple was found is in a gated community at the end of a long, curving driveway. It was a fitting home for the reclusive star, featuring expansive views of nearby mountains but secluded enough to be largely out of the range of cell phone service.\n\nHackman and Arakawa moved to the Santa Fe area more than a decade before he effectively retired from acting at age 74. \u201cIt had a kind of magic in it,\u201d he told Architectural Digest in 1990.\n\nLaw enforcement officials talk outside the home of actor Gene Hackman on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their wife were found dead in the home a day earlier. Roberto Rosales/AP\n\nHackman was \u201ca treasured New Mexico resident,\u201d New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday in a Facebook post, adding that he lived in Santa Fe \u201cas a low-key and friendly member of our community\u201d and was a beloved neighbor to many.\n\n\u201cGene\u2019s extraordinary Oscar-winning career brought characters to life with unmatched authenticity, and we were all proud to call him our neighbor,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cNew Mexico mourns the loss of this brilliant actor and longtime New Mexican. Manny and I extend our condolences to Gene\u2019s family, friends and fans all around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe treated everybody well and with graciousness and respect. The same with Betsy,\u201d Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber told NBC. \u201cThese are two people who have huge, huge talent, gifts, global reputations, and yet here in Santa Fe they\u2019re just down-to-earth people, part of the community.\u201d\n\nThe couple was often spotted in Sante Fe at their favorite restaurants or at Arakawa\u2019s shop, and everyone in town has \u201ca favorite story, a favorite memory, a huge amount of fondness and affection for both of them,\u201d Webber said.\n\nHackman, who enjoyed painting in addition to writing, was very involved with the art world, often gifting art to friends.\n\nAnother one of Hackman\u2019s friends, Stuart Ashman, remembers coming across the actor at a community arts gathering, a coincidental meeting that resulted in over 20 years of friendship, according to BBC.\n\nThe pair also attended Pilates classes together, and Hackman often got in trouble for talking too much, Ashman joked.\n\n\u201cGene, are you going to workout or do you just want to talk to Stuart today?\u201d Ashman recalls their Pilates teacher asking.\n\nAshman said he raised chickens and would often bring a dozen eggs to Hackman, who one day returned the kind gesture with a large landscape painting he made for Ashman.\n\n\u201cHe was so down to earth that you didn\u2019t realize that you were talking to a celebrity. He was more interested in you than in telling you about himself,\u201d Ashman told BBC.\n\nHackman also regularly donated his artwork for auctions, his friends say.\n\n\u201cWe just went to a big cancer auction on Valentine\u2019s that had some of the most prominent artists around donating pieces, and Gene always donated a piece,\u201d Barbara Lenihan added. \u201cA couple years ago, he had a really nice piece, we didn\u2019t even know he was doing it, and they were chuckling and saying he always runs in with the paint still wet that afternoon to hang it on the wall.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe issued a statement on Thursday saying it is \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the passing of Hackman and Arakawa.\n\n\u201cFrom 1997 to 2004, Gene served on the Museum\u2019s Board of Trustees, playing a vital role in shaping the Museum\u2019s early years,\u201d the statement read. \u201cBeyond his role as a Trustee, Gene contributed to the Museum in meaningful ways, notably as the narrator of the Perry Miller Adato film, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe: A Life in Art. The Museum is grateful for his commitment to sharing Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s legacy and their deep support of the arts and cultural initiatives.\u201d\n\nHackman had spoken at the grand opening of the O\u2019Keeffe Museum in 1997 saying, \u201cIn the 10 years I\u2019ve lived here, I\u2019ve been taken with the excitement and indomitable spirit of this place,\u201d the Santa Fe New Mexican reported in 2022.\n\nIn 2011, GQ asked Hackman how he wanted to be remembered.\n\n\u201cAs a decent actor. As someone who tried to portray what was given to them in an honest fashion,\u201d he told the magazine. When asked to sum up his life in a phrase, he said: \u201c\u2018He tried.\u2019 I think that\u2019d be fairly accurate.\u201d",

The internet-based phone and video service that was once the dominant way of staying connected in the mid-2000s is logging off for good in May.

CNN is keeping tabs on the chaotic and rapidly evolving situation.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Power player: Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting last week illustrated Musk\u2019s influence. Dressed in a MAGA hat and \u201cTech Support\u201d shirt, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX spent more time talking than anyone besides the president. Some Cabinet members are frustrated.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Who\u2019s in charge? Although Musk and his young tech-savvy assistants have been front and center, the White House says Amy Gleason is the acting administrator of DOGE. She has a background in health care and served in Trump\u2019s first administration.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Change of plans: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 an early DOGE target \u2014 abruptly dropped cases accusing several companies of ripping off consumers.

It's especially tough for people like Kevin who lives in a tent in the woods, even though he and his wife both work.\n\nWATCH HERE\n\nCouncil Bluffs couple with jobs live in tent due to housing shortage\n\nKevin says he's been waiting for house for two years.\n\nSgt. Dan Stuck with the Council Bluffs Police Homeless Outreach Program told me that's not uncommon. It's especially tough if neighbors want to stay in Pottawattamie County because of a housing shortage.\n\nBlake Johnson from Habitat for Humanity Council Bluffs said there's a need for housing at all levels: \"Housing, in general, is a vital need to, not only Council Bluffs, but the metro and all of southwest Iowa and areas that we serve.\"\n\n\n\nBROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:\n\nKevin: \"My wife and I work for a living, we're not addicts. We're just screwed.\"\n\nLast week during the depths of the winter cold, I met Kevin.\n\nI'm Southwest Iowa neighborhood reporter Katrina Markel.\n\nKevin and his wife live in a tent not too far from here because they can't find housing, despite the fact that they both have jobs.\n\nKatrina: \"We're right on the River now....\"\n\nSgt. Stuck: \"We are right on the river...\"\n\nSgt. Dan Stuck with the Council Bluffs Police Homeless Outreach Program told me that's not uncommon. It's especially tough if neighbors want to stay in Pottawattamie County because of a housing shortage.\n\n\"And then sometimes, there's, they just don't meet a certain criteria or they're not as high risk maybe, something like that, so they're lower on the list. And because of the shortage it just takes a long time to get to them,\" Stuck said.\n\n\"I've been on the housing list for over two years,\u201d said Kevin.\n\nBlake Johnson from Habitat for Humanity Council Bluffs said there's a need for housing at all levels.\n\n\"Housing, in general, is a vital need to, not only Council Bluffs but the metro and all of southwest Iowa and areas that we serve,\" he said.\n\nI talked to Council Bluffs Community Development Director Courtney Harter over the phone. She described housing as a spectrum.\n\nIf there's a shortage of new homes for sale, it also means shortages throughout the rental market because neighbors stay put and can't move up the housing ladder.\n\nThat means neighbors like Kevin are literally out in the cold, but the community is working on the problem.\n\n\"There are a lot of units being built in Council Bluffs right now,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA lot of its multi-family, apartment-style, which is just as much needed as the single-family homeownership opportunities.\"\n\nEight-hundred multi-family units are currently being built in Council Bluffs. Two-hundred of those homes are considered 'affordable.\u2019 That's 80% of the median household income for the area or $87,600 for a family of four.\n\n",

When mixed with stray voltage, snow, and salt, it's shocking dogs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, dogs in the area have passed away,\" Owczarski said.\n\nTenants hoping for solution from Wolf Point management\n\nJust this month, a dog died in River North when they walked over an electrified manhole cover at Ontario and Dearborn. There were three other reported incidents of dogs being shocked across the city.\n\nWolf Point dog owners said they sent emails to management at Hines.\n\nIn a statement, Hine said, \"Immediately upon becoming aware of the situation, we disconnected the power at the main entrance to ensure the safety of residents and pets. Our team is actively investigating the issue and will be resolving it over the next couple of days.

Dogs can also wear rubber booties.\n\nIf your pet does experience an electrical shock, call 911 immediately.",

He believes the issue shines a light on an immediate need for the county.\n\nEvan Lovett, the creator of the \"LA in a Minute\" podcast, says his home was burglarized on Friday evening while he and his family were out. The alleged thieves took off with precious family heirlooms and other items before they returned home, he says.\n\nHe said what happened next is almost more upsetting than the crime.\n\n\"Immediately when we called, it went to ... the recorded message,\" Lovett said. \"Paraphrasing, but, 'Your call is important. Don't hang up. You're in a queue and you're gonna lose your position in the queue.'\"\n\nHe said that while it's understandable to wait for a few minutes, calling an emergency service like 911 should have much more urgency.\n\n\"Once I got to the six-minute mark, like, this is pretty interesting. Six minutes turned into 15, into 20, 30, 44, finally, the 59 minute mark the call was answered,\" he recalled.\n\nThat was the first time they heard from another person on the other end of the line, asking if he was hurt or if anyone was in danger.\n\n\"I do realize that they're critically short-staffed. I know the people, they are working hard. I'm not getting any of those employees, cause that's a really difficult job, but at the same time it's something, not a flaw in the system,\" Lovett said.\n\nHe says that when he did finally speak with a dispatcher, they were great, as were the police who arrived about six minutes later.\n\n\"They explained that unfortunately they're not surprised by the dispatch times,\" Lovett said. \"Sometimes, they've heard two, two and a half hours before somebody can reach a human being on the other end of 911.\"\n\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Nithya Raman addressed the issue in a statement released to KCAL News on Saturday.\n\n\"911 wait times for non-urgent calls are unacceptably long right now due to low recruitment for open positions, for 911 operators and emergency and non-emergency calls being routed through the same operators,\" Raman's statement said. \"My office has already been working closely with city leadership over the past few months to find appropriate solutions for this. While some new operators have been hired, progress has not nearly been fast enough. The city can and must do much more to ensure that Angelenos who need help get what they need.\"\n\nMayor Karen Bass' office also issued a statement later Saturday, which read in part, \"This is unacceptable and we are looking into what happened last night. All Angelenos have the right to be safe in their homes, and it is our duty to protect that right. Last year we hired more than 100 additional 911 dispatchers and we are hiring more.\"\n\nLovett hopes that his outreach through his podcast will help expedite those changes.\n\n\"I think it's important that when you see something like this, that really can be life or death ... What if my son was choking, what if my wife, you know, fell and had an accident in the shower,\" he said. \"I would call 911, you don't even think about it.\"\n\nPolice gave him two tips in the meantime. They said that landline calls to 911 are sent directly to dispatch, whereas cellphones are routed and triaged through the county first, and that he should hardwire home surveillance cameras to prevent them from being impacted by WiFi scramblers.",

                "text": "For about seven weeks now the residents of the Meadowood Village Mobile Home Park in Littleton have been in charge of their own destiny after purchasing their park.\n\n\"A lot of people did not think we would make it. Us included at many times,\" said Sandy Cook, President of the Meadowood Village Cooperative. \"We're now the proud owners. 92 homes. 139 people of Meadowood.\"\n\nMeadowood Village Mobile Home Park\n\nMeadowood Village was faced with the sale of the property a year ago when a Utah based company offered 18 million for the property. Colorado however has a law that enables the residents of mobile home parks to make their own offers. If they can match a buyout, they can buy their own park ahead of companies seeking the benefit of rising real estate prices in Colorado. The state has about 900 mobile home parks. Few have been able to put together winning bids amid buyout offers.\n\nMeadowood Village was different.\n\nAfraid that new owners would likely raise rents for the land where they place their mobile homes, the park's board gained support from all but two residents to create a purchase offer. One resident forgot about the meeting and the other was out of town.\n\n\"The uncertainty of not being able to know where you're going to live within twelve months is so scary for people,\" said Cook.\n\nCBS\n\nOnce they matched the 18 million dollar offer, the board had to find the money. Meadowood knew they would have to carry a big mortgage. The question was, could they get enough grants and low interest loans from local, county and state government overseeing federal dollars to finance what they needed?\n\nThe final piece turned out to be a $3.475 million low-interest loan from Colorado's Department of Local Affairs.\n\n\"DOLA was our last piece. When we got our DOLA award, had it not been for our DOLA award we would not have made it,\" Cook explained.\n\nNow the residents are in charge of the over 55 park. The board noted there are far more hours involved in overseeing the park themselves. It would be harder, they acknowledged, if it were a park with younger residents.\n\nCBS\n\nBoard members said they are finding residents are more willing to pitch in.\n\n\"Now we're knowing a little about our neighbors. A lot more than when they were quiet about it. A lot of them wouldn't say anything and they'd go without,\" said Dave Stouder, operations manager for the cooperative now running the park.\n\nThe cooperative is keeping rent for the spaces where people place their mobile homes under $1000. Nearby, another park that sold recently, has seen rents rise to nearly $1500.\n\nMany of those at Meadowood are on fixed incomes. Park board members are finding that without profit margins in their non-profit corporation, they can keep costs down. The goal of keeping people who wish to stay at the park is being accomplished. A couple of residents who were short on rent have been helped by fellow residents with donations.\n\n\"They don't even realize where that subsidy is coming from. But it's actually coming from everybody in the park contributing to be able to subsidize those,\" explained Cook.\n\nManaging a park is a learning experience, but the board said they're up for the challenge. They don't have much choice. The financial deal to buy the park prohibits sale for 30 years, and no one wants to sell.\n\n\"You're always going to have to take care of the park. You're always going to have to listen to residents' problems to solve those problems for them. You still have to pay your bills, you still have to mow the grass. So it is a business, but it is a family business,\" said Cook.",

                "text": "Health officials on Tuesday advised the public that a person with a confirmed case of measles traveled through Los Angeles International Airport earlier this month.\n\nThe person, an infant from Orange County, arrived at the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal following an overseas trip aboard Korean Air Flight KAL11/KE11 on Feb 19, according to health officials with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and the Orange County Health Care Agency.\n\nNow, they're waning that anyone who was at Terminal B that day between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles, a viral infection that is currently at the center of an outbreak across the United States.\n\nPublic health officials are working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to notify any passengers that may have been sitting in specific seats on the same flight as the infant, as it may have increased their risk of exposure to the disease.\n\nOCHCA officials said that there are not any known additional community exposures beyond LAX.\n\nAnyone who may have come into contact with the child is urged to confirm their vaccination status or possible immunization through a prior infection. Those who are not immune are at risk of contracting measles between a week and three weeks from exposure, officials said.\n\n\"Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,\" said Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis in a statement. \"A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure.\"\n\nDavis continued to note that the disease is particularly dangerous for vulnerable people like young children and elderly adults.\n\n\"The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine,\" Davis' statement said.\n\nCommon symptoms of measles includes a high fever, runny nose, cough, tiny white spots inside of the mouth, red and/or watery eyes and a rash that develops within five days of other signs of illness. It typically tarts at the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said that there have been more than 120 confirmed cases of measles reported across the U.S. this year, but that the number is likely higher because of outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico. On Wednesday, the first measles-related death of the year was reported in a Texas child.",

                "text": "PUEBLO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) -- A woman who was arrested for allegedly stealing from a Colorado Springs dealership over the weekend is back in jail. This time she's in Pueblo County. Aleeyah Niknami was arrested after the Pueblo County Sheriff\u2019s Office (PCSO) says she went along with trying to steal a tractor. She, and a man named Brandt Boden, were both found on Walker Ranch.\n\nRELATED: El Paso County auto-theft suspects arrested on Pueblo County ranch after trying to steal tractor\n\nDeputies say the pair attempted to drive off in the tractor, but they also ran over one of the gates on the Walker Ranch.\n\nRemington Walker is the third generation rancher who helped PCSO locate Niknami and Boden. He says he knew something was off when he saw the tractor moving. So he drove up and got them to pull over and get out of the tractor. Walker contacted law enforcement as the pair started to walk off into the pasture. He says it was nerve-racking, but he had to get the tractor back, because losing it would be detrimental to the ranch.\n\n\"To have that stolen or destroyed, it's very impactful, you know, I mean, we don't have a lot of just money laying around to go buy another one,\" explained Walker.\n\nHe says those types of tractors cost around $250,000 and generations of ranchers before him have worked to be able to afford one. But at the end of the day he says he's grateful for the ranch's close relationship with the Sheriff's Office and for their swift response.\n\n\"You've got to feel sorry for law enforcement. You know, they go and they apprehend these bad people. and then they get turned out, they bond out. And then they come down and commit more crimes,\" stated Walker.\n\nRight now Niknami is facing multiple theft and narcotics charges, the latest are compliance in the attempted theft and an outstanding warrant, which landed her in the Pueblo County Jail. The arrest comes just days after getting out of the El Paso County Jail. Her story is reminiscent of a topic KRDO13 has covered in the past: repeat offenders.\n\nJill Gates is one of the people spearheading the charge to help incarcerated people stay out of jail.\n\nShe says it's a challenge, but she loves it. She runs the Jail-Based Behavioral Services (JBBS) program.\n\n\"We get them set up while they're in the facility, and then we work on transitioning them back out into the community with us,\" explained Gates.\n\nShe says they do group sessions for mental health challenges and substance abuse. They even work with participants for a year after their release to make sure they're set in the community.\n\n\"That's one thing we don't do. We do not give up. If there's somewhere, if there's something we can do for them, we will do it,\" shared Gates.\n\nParticipants in the JBBS program volunteer to opt-in, or they can be referred to the program. You can contact Jill Gates at 719-583-6489 to make a referral.\n\nPREVIOUS: Nearly $10,000 worth of tires and rims stolen from Colorado Springs car dealership, says police\n\nNiknami has two other open cases in El Paso County, the one from the car dealership and one with drug charges from earlier in the month.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe gunman arrived at UPMC Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania carrying a bag with a handgun and zip ties, authorities said. He went straight to the Intensive Care Unit, where he held staff members hostage until he was killed in a shootout with police.\n\nA responding police officer was killed, an intensive care unit doctor, a nurse and a custodian suffered gunshot wounds and a fourth employee was injured in a fall, according to authorities.\n\nThe York County District Attorney\u2019s Office has not released a motive, but a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN that Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, believed that more could have been done to save his wife, who was on life support at the hospital for a terminal illness.\n\nThe February 22 attack at the hospital is among an alarming number of incidents of violence against health care workers in recent years, illustrating the need for more to be done to keep patients and staff safe, experts say.\n\n\u201cWorkplace violence is a longstanding and unresolved issue in health care,\u201d Jennifer S. Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, said in a statement after the shooting, calling on the federal government to strengthen prevention and reporting requirements. \u201cIt is a growing public health crisis that demands urgent attention.\u201d\n\nViolence is typically targeted\n\nHealth care workers are five times more likely to experience workplace violence than employees in all other industries, government surveys have found.\n\nHealth care and social assistance workers accounted for 72.8% of all cases of private industry workplace violence from 2021-2022, more than any other sector, according to the latest data available from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. And while health care workers make up 10% of the workforce, \u201cthey experience 48% of the nonfatal injuries due to workplace violence,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in 2024.\n\nA 2023 Survey of Registered Nurses from AMN Healthcare, a nurse staffing company, found what AMN Chief Clinical Officer Cole Edmonson called a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of problems in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to take care of people, and they\u2019re lashing out at us,\u201d Terry Foster, a critical-care nurse and past president of the Emergency Nurses Association, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s patients who don\u2019t want to wait, or they act out or are very dramatic or violent. And sometimes our patients are fine, but their families will lash out at us and threaten us.\u201d\n\nThe International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety\u2019s 2023 Healthcare Crime Survey showed that simple assault on health care facility staff rose over three years from 10 incidents per 100 beds to 22 incidents.\n\n\u201cAnyone you talk to in health care is going to tell you that since Covid we\u2019ve definitely seen a significant rise in workplace violence for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Eric Clay, vice president of security services, Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston, and past president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety.\n\nMany health care settings are stressful and emotions can run high for patients and providers, especially in emergency departments.\n\n\u201cWe see people typically on their worst day, right when they\u2019re going through some sort of trauma, emotional trauma, physical trauma, and to be honest, there can be significant wait times in ED,\u201d Clay said.\n\nOften, active shooter situations covered by the media are mass shooters with seemingly random victims, but violence at hospitals is typically targeted, according to Clay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a perceived wrong that either the physician has not given the treatment or the outcome has not been what was expected, or a domestic violence situation,\u201d Clay said.\n\nHealth care workers attacked across US\n\nLast year, a Nashville man seeking mental health assistance but unsatisfied with his treatment allegedly assaulted a security guard and threatened to take the lives of hospital employees before being arrested.\n\nIn August 2024, a primary care and emergency physician in Woodland Hills, California, was walking to his car from his medical practice when he was shot and killed in what the Los Angeles Police Department called a targeted attack.\n\nA man police said was seeking new treatment after being dissatisfied with the care he was receiving from the Department of Veterans Affairs went to Northside Medical Midtown in Atlanta in May 2023 and opened fire, killing a 38-year-old woman and wounding four others.\n\nPolice patrol near the crime scene following a shooting at Northside Medical Midtown in Atlanta on May 3, 2023. Alyssa Pointer/Reuters\n\nA security guard working at a Concord, New Hampshire, psychiatric hospital was fatally shot in November 2023.\n\nA gunman killed two doctors and two others at Tulsa, Oklahoma\u2019s Saint Francis Hospital in 2022 after he blamed one of the physicians for causing him pain from a recent back surgery, police said.\n\nIn 2022, a man killed two employees of Methodist Dallas Medical Center in Dallas inside the \u201cmother/baby\u201d unit.\n\n\u2018I relive it when my eyes are opened and closed\u2019\n\nHospital officials and law enforcement have not provided information about security measures in place at UPMC Memorial at the time of the February 22 attack, but in a statement the day after the shooting the hospital said, \u201cUPMC Police and Security have enhanced their presence.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the hospital for details.\n\nArchangel-Ortiz was removed from the hospital by security the previous night after becoming irate and emotionally overwrought following a diagnosis that there was no other treatment available for his wife, the official briefed on the investigation said. It is not clear whether she has died.\n\nYork County District Attorney Tim Barker said at a news conference the day of the attack that Archangel-Ortiz had \u201ccontact previously in the week in the ICU for a medical purpose involving another individual,\u201d but his office has declined to provide additional information.\n\nArchangel-Ortiz returned to the hospital last Saturday morning, carrying a backpack with a firearm, zip ties and duct tape, and held staff members hostage before being killed in a shootout with police, officials said.\n\nNurse Tosha Trostle said in a Facebook post she was one of those hostages. Trostle said she was drawing blood from a patient when she heard a commotion and went to see if she could help, not knowing there was an active shooter.\n\nWhen she went into the corridor, she saw Archangel-Ortiz holding her coworker at gunpoint. The coworker \u201cwas forced to zip tie my hands behind my back,\u201d and Trostle then \u201cheard the shots fired into her\u201d colleague, the post said.\n\nTrostle said the attacker then grabbed her and \u201cpushed the gun against my neck and spine,\u201d holding her against him as a shield when they encountered \u201ca wall of armed officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sound of gunshots rang out and the smell of smoke, the sound of empty shells echoing as the(y) hit the floor,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI eventually fell into the floor under the weight of the shooter\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nAs she got to her feet, an officer ushered her into another room.\n\n\u201cSadly, the experience doesn\u2019t end there\u2026 I relive it when my eyes are opened and closed,\u201d she said.\n\nThe challenge of keeping hospitals safe\n\nHospitals are particularly challenging to secure because of the way they are set up, Clay said.\n\n\u201cBy their very design, hospitals are built to be warm, welcoming, easy to access places of healing. Which makes them difficult to secure and monitor,\u201d Clay said.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t also be secure. Good security starts with hospital leadership, who should communicate to their employees a commitment to preventing workplace violence, Clay said.\n\n\u201cEmployees need to know they are supported from the top down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should include medical and psychological support for both victims and witnesses of violence.\u201d\n\nBy training staff to recognize early warning signs and triggers of violence, the focus can be on early interventions before situations escalate, as well as techniques to deescalate patients and visitors, Clay said.\n\nTechnology also has a significant role to play, such as controlled access to different parts of a hospital campus, wearable duress alarms for staff and concealed weapons detection.\n\nIn fact, Clay believes that within the next three to five years concealed weapons detection technology will be a staple of most hospital security management plans. These devices are more precise and subtle than old fashioned metal detectors, using specific sensitivity settings and artificial intelligence to detect hidden weapons as opposed to harmless items such as keys and phones, allowing people to enter facilities with very little delay.\n\nConcealed weapons detection technology such as this at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston uses precise settings and artificial intelligence to detect hidden weapons. Eric Clay/Memorial Hermann Health System\n\nIn some cases, hospitals have formed their own police departments or decided to arm their security guards.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s up to each health care facility to conduct a risk assessment and determine if there is a need to arm their security officers,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIf they use an outside consultant, I would stress that they use someone with actual, confirmed health care security experience.\u201d\n\nThere is no one solution to secure everything, Clay said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day everything that we are implementing, which includes the concealed weapons detection, the armed security officers and a lot of other things that we\u2019re doing, are part of a layered plan that is designed to ensure the safety and security of our patients and of our employees and of our visitors.\u201d\n\nWorkplace violence is \u2018a community issue\u2019\n\nUltimately, security in health care settings is about more than safety. Clay said a good security management plan strengthens employee retention and reduces the anxiety of caregivers, which allows them to focus on care.\n\n\u201cNot having to worry about their safety, they\u2019re able to provide that quality care which translates, in my opinion, to allowing the patients to really focus on healing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it keeps nurses and caregivers in our facilities.\u201d\n\nA 2024 State of US Nursing Report found that a shocking 88% of nurses surveyed think staffing shortages are having a detrimental impact on patient care. Furthermore, half of nurses have been \u201cverbally and/or physically assaulted by a patient or a member of a patient\u2019s family within the past year,\u201d and 26% of nurses indicated they are likely to leave their current role as a result of these incidents, according to the report, issued by nurse hiring platform Incredible Health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that workplace violence is not solely a health care issue. It\u2019s a community issue,\u201d Clay said. \u201cIn order to ensure our communities have access to quality, affordable health care, we must support our caregivers\u2026 Failure to do so will have a detrimental and long lasting effect on health care and patient outcomes.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn cities across the United States someone or something is almost always watching you. On Tuesday, as Mardi Gras revelers flock to New Orleans to celebrate the end of Carnival, it will be no different.\n\nSurveillance cameras are crucial for deterring and solving crimes, finding missing people and fighting terrorism in cities across the US, but a unique web of eyes is observing Bourbon Street.\n\nSpawned in the aftermath of a natural disaster, Project NOLA, a community-based network in New Orleans and beyond is using its web of 10,000 security cameras to offer high-definition surveillance to dozens of law enforcement agencies serving communities from coast to coast.\n\nWhat sets the nonprofit\u2019s model apart is that their cameras are positioned on private homes and businesses and can be outfitted with facial recognition, license plate reading and clothing recognition software.\n\nSome studies have shown that areas covered by surveillance cameras generally see significant crime reductions, but critics worry advanced facial recognition software violates the public\u2019s right to privacy, and disproportionately targets people of color.\n\n\u2018Everything was normal until it wasn\u2019t\u2019\n\nMere hours into the new year, the team at Project NOLA was focused on a shooting in Adams County, Mississippi \u2013 one of many cities and towns across the country where Project NOLA operates \u2013 when the phone rang.\n\nIt was a New Orleans police officer.\n\n\u201cEverything was normal until it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Project NOLA criminologist Bryan Lagarde told CNN.\n\n\u201cShe told us that she was standing on Bourbon Street surrounded by injured and dead and that it was a terrorist attack,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nSomeone had plowed a three-ton pickup truck through crowds of New Years Eve revelers, killing 14 people and injuring dozens of others.\n\nProject NOLA camera shows the intersection of Canal & Bourbon Street several seconds before the January 1 terrorist attack. This image has been blurred by the source. Courtesy Project NOLA\n\n\u201cWe just went into full high gear,\u201d said Lagarde.\n\nThe team began scouring footage from their cameras surrounding the French Quarter, tracing the movements of the Ford F-150: Where had it been before the attack? Did the driver have accomplices?\n\nPolice later identified the driver as Shamsud-Din Jabbar.\n\n\u201cOnce the person \u2013 the driver \u2013 was identified, we started going back in time using facial recognition, clothing recognition to retrace that person\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nWhen a Louisiana state trooper called to report he\u2019d found an improvised explosive device in an ice cooler on the street, the search pivoted, looking for more coolers and anyone who touched them.\n\n\u201cWe were having to work on the assumption that there may possibly have been more than one terrorist\u2026 over time we were able to learn it was one bad actor that did everything, but then of course we were looking at everybody.\u201d\n\nWhen an improvised explosive device was found in a cooler on the street after the New Years attack, the search began for more coolers, and anyone who touched them. Courtesy Project NOLA\n\nFor weeks after the tragedy, Project NOLA continued to help law enforcement with the investigation by following up on leads, and fact-checking witness accounts against their recordings.\n\n\u201cThis is the part that actually went on for a lot longer than a lot of people might realize as tips came into the FBI,\u201d Legarde said.\n\n\u2018After Katrina\u2026 we had to do something\u2019\n\nProject NOLA invokes the name of the city where it is based but the acronym stands for \u201cNational Online Law-Enforcement Assistance.\u201d Lagarde, now its executive director, founded the initiative in 2010, but its impetus was New Orleans\u2019 long struggle to rebuild and recover from Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\u201cWhen Katrina hit New Orleans, we lost a very large portion of the housing here, and as a result, we lost a lot of police officers. There was no place for them to live. We needed to do something now to act as a force multiplier,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nA former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator who spent many hours staking out suspects in the New Orleans heat, Lagarde says he taught himself about digital video cameras and writing more efficient computer code.\n\n\u201cI knew how well having crime cameras helped with solving crimes, so I put my expertise to work and created Project NOLA,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nAs a nonprofit, Project NOLA is independent of any one municipality and offers its base model cameras to would-be hosts free of charge and upgrades them every five years. Add-ons like facial recognition or license plate reading software are extra. Project NOLA also charges users a fee to host the footage on their private servers at the University of New Orleans.\n\nLagarde said 99 percent of the project\u2019s funding comes from charitable donations and bequests.\n\n\u201cA vast majority of our cameras are on people\u2019s homes, businesses, churches, and schools. It\u2019s one of the things that helps sets apart how we operate,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to benefit law enforcement and public safety, but it\u2019s on private property. It goes where the community wants the cameras, not where someone else decides where the camera is going to go.\u201d\n\nA camera operates in the French Quarter of New Orleans on February 3, 2025. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nIn 2016, Project NOLA partnered with the University of New Orleans which now houses the group\u2019s National Real-Time Crime Center where cameras are monitored and simulcast to the municipalities and police monitoring stations the project serves, according to Lagarde.\n\nProject NOLA itself only has a full-time staff of five people, Lagarde said, but they do their best to monitor certain areas and events. Otherwise, the local municipalities can monitor as they deem necessary.\n\n\u201cWe might not be watching the fictional sleepy town of Mayberry, but their local police department and sheriff\u2019s department might have the cameras up 24/7 with somebody watching them,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\nOverall crime in New Orleans dropped 23 percent in 2024 when compared to the average of the previous five years, according to police department statistics.\n\nNew Orleans Police did not specifically credit Project NOLA with the decrease, but in the department\u2019s 8th District, which includes the French Quarter, the NOPD said that in late 2024 they had a 90-percent apprehension rate for violent crimes like shootings and armed robberies and investigators had solved every case they\u2019d been assigned for the past four months.\n\nCNN has reached out to the department for more information about how they work with the program.\n\nThe camera quality and sophisticated software used by Project NOLA makes for clearer, easier to use images, according to Lagarde.\n\n\u201cWe use live facial recognition, so each one of our cameras, like the ones on Bourbon Street, they can scan up to 300-something faces per second,\u201d he said, adding that advancements in tracking technology makes the cameras more effective.\n\n\u201cWe can put a single camera on the corner of a building that\u2019s at an intersection and with our cameras we can see faces two city blocks away, license plates in a 360-degree arc,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cIf you were to go into the French Quarter, you can tell which ones are ours because our cameras are constantly moving.\u201d\n\n\u2018If abused, it would be a very bad thing\u2019\n\nProject NOLA maintains what it calls a \u201chot list\u201d of mug shots and information on wanted fugitives. As its cameras sweep an area, they are constantly comparing the passing faces to that list, according to Lagarde.\n\n\u201cSo, if you\u2019re walking down Bourbon Street and if you personally are not wanted, it\u2019s going to scan your face and it\u2019s going to completely disregard you, because you\u2019re not wanted,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cIf you were wanted, then instantly in that same moment it\u2019s going to send an alert to on-duty police officers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn busy nights sometimes that will play out a couple times or a few times a day,\u201d\n\nAs facial recognition technology advances and surveillance cameras become more sophisticated, the potential for abuse sparks alarm for some.\n\n\u201cFacial recognition surveillance, like Project NOLA, is racially biased and dangerously unreliable. Law enforcement boasts when the technology correctly identifies a suspect but stays silent when it falsely accuses innocent people \u2013 disproportionately Black individuals,\u201d ACLU of Louisiana Executive Director Alanah Odoms told CNN in a statement. \u201cTime and again, officials claim these tools are only used responsibly, but history proves otherwise. The public has no reason to trust Project NOLA or the agencies using it.\u201d\n\nThe National Real Time Crime Center is seen at the University of New Orleans. Courtesy Project NOLA\n\nProject NOLA said it prioritizes individual privacy, and its active facial recognition technology is very accurate. Lagarde said it is better for a nonprofit to be the steward of such capabilities than a police force or government.\n\n\u201cWith the technologies that we use, specifically facial recognition, things of that sort, we\u2019re certainly by far more comfortable with that funding coming from charitable organizations. That makes it a community\u2019s choice if they want to do it or not versus just someone else deciding for them that it\u2019s going to be done,\u201d Lagarde said.\n\n\u201cIf a community or a neighborhood doesn\u2019t want it then they don\u2019t host our cameras or they host our cameras and then don\u2019t give us permission for us to use facial recognition, which is fine by us,\u201d he continued.\n\nThis also means that being outside the government, Project NOLA isn\u2019t subject to public records requests.\n\nThe raw footage and metadata from the project\u2019s cameras had been automatically deleted and overwritten every 30 days, but since the Bourbon Street terror attack, Lagarde said the organization is increasing the retention time to two or three months in case investigators need to track a suspect back a longer time.\n\nBut even Lagarde acknowledged that a surveillance network like Project NOLA can be frightening to some.\n\n\u201cRealistically, there\u2019s always going to be people who are going to be concerned, I mean, frankly the technology if abused, it would be a very bad thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mysterious death of Adan Manzano\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the New Years Eve attack that Project NOLA was brought into another high-profile case.\n\nAdan Manzano, a 27-year-old sports reporter from Kansas City in New Orleans to cover Super Bowl LIX was found dead in his hotel room. His credit card and phone had been stolen.\n\nPolice have identified a suspect, and Project NOLA has been using its extensive network of cameras \u2013 Lagarde said there over 5,000 in the city \u2013 to help investigators develop a timeline of when Manzano was first seen in the French Quarter with the suspect to when she accompanied him to his hotel.\n\nInvestigators are looking into the possibility that Manzano was drugged before his death, Kenner Police have said. Project NOLA is assisting the police department in establishing a timeline and possibly the suspect\u2019s mode of operation through video footage.\n\nThis photo provided by Telemundo Kansas City shows television reporter Adan Manzano, who was found dead in his hotel room Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025 while visiting New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl.

Even in her 90s, she spoke out against police brutality and for adequate health care in underserved neighborhoods, the NAACP\u2019s New York State chapter said in a statement.\n\nIn 2023, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Dukes with the NAACP\u2019s highest honor \u2014 the Spingarn Medal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tired yet,\u201d Dukes said in her acceptance speech for the award. She added that she would continue her advocacy and empower the next generation of NAACP leaders.\n\nDukes helped lay the foundation for Black women to ascend to the nation\u2019s highest offices. In 1972, she took the stage at the Democratic National Convention to second the presidential candidacy of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nDukes was instrumental in former President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to choose a Black woman as his 2020 running mate, she noted in an interview with CBS last year. Her career-long fight was bookended by former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 2024 bid for the presidency.\n\nIn a post in X Saturday, Harris called Dukes one of the heroes \u201cupon whose broad shoulders we stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just proud of Kamala.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFive months after Hurricane Helene severed a critical Appalachian freight corridor, a 12-mile stretch of Interstate 40 through North Carolina\u2019s Pigeon River Gorge reopened Saturday.\n\nThough still a construction zone, the highway is mostly operational. Its four lanes have been reduced to two, with the roadway held together by nails drilled deep into the mountainside. Tractor-trailers now thread between 9-inch concrete barriers as engineers continue their work.\n\nReopening that stretch of I-40 restores a vital freight corridor that supports both regional industries and national supply chains.\n\nBefore Hurricane Helene washed out a 4-mile stretch of I-40 connecting North Carolina and Tennessee in late September, this section of the highway served as a trucking route linking East Coast ports to Midwestern hubs.\n\nIts closure disrupted shipments of everything from auto parts to produce from Tennessee, while stranding tourists headed for Asheville, where the hospitality industry generates over $2 billion annually.\n\nState officials estimate the closure cost local businesses millions in lost revenue, underscoring I-40\u2019s role as an economic lifeline for western North Carolina and beyond.\n\n\u201cYou start thinking, \u2018What the heck are we going to do?\u2019 Because operational-wise, that\u2019s where 90% to 95% of our trucks take that route every single day,\u201d said Spencer Linn, vice president of East West Inc., a North Carolina-based family trucking company that transports auto parts nationwide.\n\nThe closure of I-40 forced Linn\u2019s drivers to add nearly 300 miles to their routes, significantly cutting into revenue as they rerouted shipments to key destinations like Indianapolis, Chicago, and Kansas City.\n\nEven with the highway reopening, Linn remains concerned about lingering challenges. \u201cWe believe that even when it opens there\u2019s going to be a lot of logistical issues and a lot of delays with it being one lane,\u201d he told CNN affiliate Spectrum News Charlotte.\n\nA temporary fix\n\nThe highway\u2019s reopening marks a fragile victory \u2014 a temporary fix that funnels traffic through single lanes flanked by construction crews still drilling into crumbling slopes, with speed limits halved to 35 mph and oversized trucks banned indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThis is an active work zone,\u201d warned North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) engineer Nathan Tanner, who oversaw the emergency stabilization of the slopes. \u201cOur contractors will be pursuing the permanent repair of I-40 the entire time they\u2019re traveling through this location.\u201d\n\nSo, how do you rebuild a completely washed-out stretch of highway perched precariously next to a winding river? The answer: nails. Not just any nails \u2014 long, steel-reinforced soil nails.\n\nA view of a soil nail wall along a damaged portion of I-40 at the Tennessee and North Carolina state line on Thursday. Brianna Paciorka/News Sentinel/USA Today Network/Imagn Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary shoring mechanism that uses steel rods drilled into the mountainside into competent rock to hold everything in place so that we didn\u2019t lose any more of the open travel lanes,\u201d Tanner explained at a news conference Friday.\n\nGeotechnical engineers installed 90,000 square feet of soil-nail walls, drilled nearly 2,100 feet of nails, and utilized 15,200 pounds of steel across damaged portions of the highway to fortify 4 miles of the shoulder for truck traffic, according to NCDOT.\n\nCurrent costs for the temporary fix of the washed-out portion of I-40 are estimated to be upwards of $15 million, Tanner said. He added that costs for the permanent repair to the highway are still being calculated, and exact figures weren\u2019t readily available.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy visited the storm ravaged region for the first time in February where he emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s intent to \u201cbuild infrastructure faster, better, and more affordably.\u201d\n\nDuring his visit, Duffy announced a partnership between the US Department of Transportation and the US Forest Service to grant a \u201cSpecial Use\u201d permit allowing NCDOT to use construction materials from nearby locations \u2014 reducing costs, saving time, and lowering environmental impact by cutting transportation distances.\n\nHurricane Helene\u2019s fury\n\nWhile the reopening of the washed-out portion of I-40 marks a significant milestone in post-Helene recovery efforts, the road to full restoration remains fraught with challenges.\n\nHurricane Helene left a trail of devastation across the southeast, causing widespread and devastating flooding that transformed entire communities into scenes of \u201cbiblical devastation.\u201d\n\nThe Category 4 storm made landfall on September 26, unleashing record-setting storm surges and life-threatening flash floods that killed at least 232 people across six states.\n\nThe storm ravaged the terrain alongside I-40, eroding 3 million cubic yards of earth and rock from the mountainside, leaving behind a scarred landscape and a daunting reconstruction challenge.\n\nIn North Carolina, then-Gov. Roy Cooper described Helene as \u201cone of the worst storms in modern history\u201d for the state, with western regions experiencing intense rainfall and robust winds that turned roads into rivers and stranded many without essential supplies.\n\n\u201cDamage estimates from what we have been able to assess to this point are up to several billion dollars and we\u2019re not done,\u201d state Transportation Secretary Joey Hopkins said in October.\n\nHopkins updated state officials Thursday on NCDOT\u2019s progress, warning they \u201chaven\u2019t spent 10% of what we estimate it is going to cost, and it\u2019s going to take years to do this.\u201d\n\nOfficials estimate it will take another two to three years to fully restore I-40 to its original four-lane capacity. However, this timeline is contingent on several factors, including material availability and weather conditions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about 10 to 12 percent into designing a permanent solution,\u201d Tanner said.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to have this open for the people who depend on a connected transportation system between North Carolina and Tennessee,\u201d said NCDOT Division 14 engineer Wanda Payne.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAfter nearly three decades maintaining his innocence on Oklahoma\u2019s death row, Richard Glossip this week now has the opportunity to win his freedom after the US Supreme Court ordered he receive a new trial, finding prosecutors failed to correct false testimony that may have influenced his jury.\n\nThe question now? Whether Oklahoma prosecutors want to retry the case at all.\n\nSince Glossip\u2019s 1998 conviction as the alleged orchestrator of a murder-for-hire scheme targeting his boss, Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese, a raft of issues with his prosecution has surfaced, coinciding with a shift of political winds now at the inmate\u2019s back.\n\nAside from his attorneys, the fight to spare Glossip\u2019s life has been largely helmed by pro-death penalty Republicans, most notably Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond: He and others have said it\u2019s important Oklahomans have faith the death penalty is fairly administrated, and that Glossip\u2019s execution would erode trust in the state\u2019s justice system, given the questions surrounding his case.\n\n\u201cI have long maintained that I do not believe Mr. Glossip is innocent, but it is now an undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial,\u201d Drummond said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nDrummond and Oklahoma County District Attorney Vicki Behenna \u2013 the former director of the Oklahoma Innocence Project \u2013 must now decide whether to prosecute Glossip again. That would be \u201cdifficult,\u201d Drummond told reporters, and their choice will rest on a review of the evidence and witnesses still available more than 30 years after Van Treese\u2019s murder.\n\n\u201cShe and I will collaborate together with our staffs,\u201d he said, \u201cand we will review the evidence with fresh eyes and interview those witnesses that would be available to us to make a determination whether we should proceed seeking again the death penalty, whether we should proceed seeking life without the opportunity for parole, or if we should proceed with a lesser charged crime.\u201d\n\nRe-prosecuting old cases can be challenging, because witnesses\u2019 memories fade and physical evidence may decay or be lost altogether with the passage of time.\n\nBut in a retrial of Glossip\u2019s case, prosecutors would have to contend with another issue: The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and other revelations have undermined the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s star witness: Van Treese\u2019s actual killer, Justin Sneed, who got a life sentence in exchange for a guilty plea and for testifying against Glossip.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling Tuesday stemmed directly from Sneed\u2019s testimony, the sole evidence linking Glossip, the motel\u2019s manager, to the killing. The majority found prosecutors had not corrected false testimony Sneed provided at trial; had they, his credibility would have suffered, undercutting his testimony \u2013 the lodestar of the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\nWhile Drummond left the door open to all possibilities at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, he also appeared to signal that \u2013 however prosecutors move forward \u2013 they may have little appetite for pursuing a capital sentence.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond does not believe Richard Glossip is innocent, he said, but it is an \"undeniable fact that he did not receive a fair trial.\" Sarah Phipps/The Oklahoman/USA Today Network/Imagn Images\n\n\u201cI believe that under today\u2019s standard, very few prosecutors would seek a death penalty,\u201d he said, reiterating he does not believe Glossip is innocent. By the inmate\u2019s own admission, Drummond said, he would be guilty of accessory to murder after the fact, for initially lying to police about having knowledge of Van Treese\u2019s killing.\n\nRobin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, called the Supreme Court ruling a \u201cvaluable opportunity\u201d for state prosecutors \u201cto fulfill their ethical and professional duties to \u2018seek justice\u2019 and not merely pursue another conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn light of all the compelling evidence of Mr. Glossip\u2019s innocence,\u201d she told CNN, \u201cI think it would be very difficult to justify another capital prosecution.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Glossip remains in prison. On Tuesday, Drummond requested the inmate be moved off death row, but he asked the state Department of Corrections maintain custody of Glossip until there is a decision about whether to retry him.\n\nThe murder of Barry Van Treese\n\nGlossip\u2019s case dates to January 7, 1997, when Van Treese, a 54-year-old father of seven, was beaten to death at his motel by Sneed, then 19, court records state. At the time, Sneed was staying at the motel while doing maintenance work in exchange for a room.\n\nGlossip, after initially denying knowledge of the killing, eventually admitted Sneed had told him about killing Van Treese. He said he had feared telling the truth because failing to notify police immediately might mean he was \u201calready involved in it.\u201d\n\nGlossip was at first charged with accessory after the fact. But Sneed implicated Glossip, saying he asked Sneed to kill Van Treese so he could run the motel himself. His charge was upgraded to capital murder, and when Glossip refused a deal for a life sentence, insisting on his innocence, prosecutors offered Sneed the same deal. At trial, they cast Glossip as the engineer of the murder-for-hire plot.\n\nGlossip was convicted and sentenced to death in 1998, but that initial outcome was overturned on appeal due to ineffective counsel. He was retried again in 2004, and he was once again convicted and sentenced to die.\n\nYears later, however \u2013 after two independent investigations cast serious doubt on Glossip\u2019s conviction \u2013 the state disclosed evidence that Sneed told prosecutors he was under the care of a jail psychiatrist who had diagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed him lithium.\n\nBut when Sneed claimed at trial he had never seen a psychiatrist and the lithium was prescribed after he asked for cold medicine, prosecutors did not correct him. Doing so would have undermined his credibility, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority.\n\n\u201cBesides Sneed,\u201d Sotomayor wrote, \u201cno other witness and no physical evidence established that Glossip orchestrated Van Treese\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\nDoubt undercuts key testimony\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling would further undercut Sneed\u2019s testimony if he took the stand in a retrial, although it\u2019s unclear if he would.\n\nOne of the independent reviews, conducted by law firm Reed Smith at the Oklahoma legislature\u2019s request, uncovered statements Sneed made indicating he might want to recant his testimony. In 2007, he wrote to his attorney, \u201cThere are a lot of things right now that are eating at me,\u201d and, \u201cI think you know were (sic) I\u2019m going it was a mistake.\u201d\n\nCNN was unsuccessful in its attempts to reach Sneed for comment through the Oklahoma County Public Defender\u2019s Office, which represented him at trial. He remains in prison.\n\nPlus, many of the revelations in recent years would be admissible in a retrial, including the withholding and destruction of evidence and Sneed\u2019s letter, according to Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn his brief and tumultuous life, Malcolm X took on so many identities that it can be hard to know which version someone is talking about when they cite his legacy.\n\nIn one of his earliest incarnations, he was Malcolm Little, the charming and whip-smart student who was elected class president by White students at his junior high school. In another, he was \u201cDetroit Red,\u201d the Harlem street hustler who wore flashy zoot suits. He eventually morphed into a fiery spokesman for the Nation of Islam who once said, \u201cthe only thing I like integrated is my coffee.\u201d\n\nBy the time his life was cut short at age 39 by assassins, he had changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz and was moving toward another identity as a Sunni Muslim and a Pan-African leader who had renounced his hatred of White people.\n\nBut when Ibram X. Kendi, author of the New York Times # 1 bestseller \u201cHow To be an Antiracist,\u201d began writing a biography of the civil rights leader for young readers, he uncovered yet another Malcolm X: a thoroughly contemporary figure who would fit right into America\u2019s turbulent political landscape of 2025.\n\nKendi says Malcolm would have been uncomfortably familiar with rising Islamophobia in the US, the surge in White Christian nationalism and politicians who routinely deploy White supremacist rhetoric.\n\nAnd the recent campaign to abolish DEI efforts across America would have reminded Malcolm of growing up in a \u201cseparate but unequal\u201d society under Jim Crow laws, Kendi says.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate impact of the erasure of our ability to promote diversity, inclusion and equality is to have a nation that Malcolm could recognize,\u201d Kendi says. \u201cWhen he died in 1965, the nation was just beginning to be desegregated, particularly in places like Mississippi and Alabama. That\u2019s the irony \u2014 we could be headed towards a nation that is entirely recognizable by Malcom X, and by people who did not live past the 1960s.\u201d\n\nThat Kendi would make such an assessment is another grim irony. Five years ago, the scholar was a symbol of racial optimism in America. He became an intellectual celebrity in the George Floyd summer of 2020 after his books became a go-to source for millions of Americans who, at least for a moment, experienced a racial reckoning.\n\nDr. Ibram X. Kendi speaks at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2023, in Toronto, Ontario. Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images\n\nHe was awarded a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant,\u201d became a sought-after commentator on race and added a new word to the way we talk about it: antiracist. The term means to actively fight against racism rather than passively claim to be non-racist.\n\nThen came the \u201cWhitelash.\u201d Kendi\u2019s books were banned by some school libraries, and he became a central villain in a GOP-led campaign to purge the teaching of systemic racism in American public schools.\n\nToday, however, Kendi is back with an upcoming book, \u201cMalcolm Lives!\u201d Billed as the first major biography of Malcolm X for young people in more than 30 years, it\u2019s set to be published in May on the centennial of Malcolm\u2019s birth in 1925.\n\nThe fast-moving narrative uncovers a side of Malcolm that remains unknown to even some of his biggest followers: the staggering brutality he experienced as a child, the tender letters he exchanged with relatives, and a shocking revelation about the identity of the man who founded the Nation of Islam, the Black separatist group that was catapulted out of obscurity by Malcolm\u2019s charisma.\n\nCNN talked to Kendi about who assassinated Malcolm X, why he thinks Malcolm would recognize America in 2025 and how Malcolm\u2019s example could help inspire antiracists who feel demoralized today.\n\nThere have been many books about Malcolm X. Why have you written about him now, and what are you offering that\u2019s distinctive?\n\nWe\u2019re living in a time that Malcolm X would recognize. A time when you have different groups of Black people who are divided politically. A time when Islamophobia and even genocide against Muslims are ever-present. A time when White nationalists and White supremacists are gaining control of governments.\n\nIf there was ever a person in American history who was fearless, who had the capacity to not only unite Black people but boldly challenge racism, global White supremacy and Islamophobia \u2014 and could not be co-opted because he truly loved Black people \u2014 it was Malcolm X. I wanted the book to convey that his bold voice is here with us in this moment.\n\nMalcolm X talks to a woman inside Temple 7, a Halal restaurant patronized by black Muslims, at Lenox Avenue and 116th Street in New York in 1965. Richard Saunders/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe book is written primarily for young people, but of course adults will read it. Many people are not fully aware of all that Malcolm went through as a young person. It was critically important to chronicle Malcolm\u2019s youth so that readers could fully understand all he had to overcome so that youth who are facing similar challenges \u2014 whether they\u2019re impoverished or hungry, in foster care, incarcerated, lost their parents, or they\u2019ve been separated from their siblings \u2014 they could relate to Malcolm and realize that they could be an impactful person like him.\n\nWhat are some of the common myths about Malcolm X?\n\nHe\u2019s contrasted with King (The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.), so that there\u2019s this notion that King is this non-violent activist and Malcolm is the violent activist. Malcolm X was a champion of self-defense. He would often say to his followers, do not hit anyone, fight anyone or break the law. Do not engage in violence. But if somebody lays their hands on you, you have to defend yourself. The teaching of people to defend themselves has been transformed into somehow (that) Malcolm was violent.\n\nI also don\u2019t think people know the full extent of his travels. By the last few years of his life, he truly had a global outlook on racism and imperialism. He was constantly trying to encourage members of the Nation of Islam, and ultimately his followers and other organizations, to recognize the global import of what they were facing in the United States. People don\u2019t fully grasp just how much he was thinking about Black life and struggle all over the world. He visited Gaza. He spoke to students and community leaders in dozens of countries across Africa, the Middle East and in Europe about their issues and how it connected back to the United States.\n\nYou mention King. There is a tantalizing passage in the book where you write about their one and only meeting in 1964. The photo of that meeting, with King and Malcolm standing side by side, is seared in my mind. What would have happened if Malcolm had survived? What kind of relationship would he have developed with King and other civil rights leaders?\n\nIn the last year of his life, Malcolm routinely spoke about a willingness to work closely with other civil rights leaders. One of the major reasons for leaving the Nation of Islam was to be able to form coalitions with civil rights leaders. What\u2019s striking is in 1967, Martin Luther King started expressing ideas from the Black Power movement that was largely birthed by Malcolm X. By 1967, King was moving towards Malcolm. King was talking about the importance of Black solidarity, and the recognition that there are these ideas suggesting that everything Black is bad.\n\nThe brief, and only, meeting between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. in the halls of the US Capitol in Washington. Both men were attending a Senate hearing on the Civil Rights Act on March 26, 1964. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nIf Malcolm had lived and Martin continued to move closer to Malcolm, as Malcolm moved closer to Martin, they could have created a grand alliance that could have attracted Black people across the country. Between the two of them, you had a person who was from the North, and another person who\u2019s from the South. You had a person who was raised in the Black middle class (and) another person who came out of a working-class family. You had a person who was a Christian, and another who was Muslim.\n\nYou had a person who was comfortable speaking to people who were incarcerated, impoverished or who were sex workers. You had another person who could give the baddest sermons in any church in this country. Together, they represented so many facets of Black America. If they came together and formed a grand alliance, it could have been quite powerful.\n\nThere\u2019s another moment in your book that\u2019s striking. Is it true that Nation of Islam was founded by a White man who was a con artist?\n\nYes.\n\nPlease elaborate.\n\nThis finding was first discovered by (the late journalist) Les Payne. He, of course, revealed it in his book, \u201cThe Dead are Arising.\u201d He revealed that the man known as Wallace Fard was a White man from New Zealand but presented himself to the early leaders of the Nation of Islam, including Elijah Muhammad, as this \u2018quote unquote\u2019 Asiatic Black man from the Middle East. He had a long track record of conning people, including members of the Nation of Islam.\n\nWas the Nation of Islam responsible for assassinating Malcolm in 1965?\n\nIt\u2019s a fact that the five assassins were not only members of the Nation of Islam, but members of the Newark mosque of the Nation of Islam. The question becomes \u2014 and I think this is the question that Malcolm\u2019s family and his estate are seeking to answer \u2014 is the role that the NYPD played, the role that the FBI played and potentially even the role that the CIA played in Malcolm\u2019s assassination. It\u2019s one thing to actually pull the trigger. It\u2019s another thing to create the circumstances in which the trigger can be pulled.\n\nActor-playwright Ossie Davis speaks to a crowd of some 1,000 people attending Malcolm X's funeral service on February 27, 1965, at the Church of God in Christ in New York City. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nToward the end of the book, you talk about what Malcolm meant to you personally as a young man. Could you elaborate?\n\nOn so many different levels, Malcolm meant something to me. I was not necessarily a reader when I was younger. I didn\u2019t really start reading until I went to college. I was around the same age as Malcolm when he was incarcerated and started reading. I had grown up thinking that the problem was Black people, only to realize that those ideas were the problem and that there was nothing wrong with Black people \u2014 just as Malcolm had grown up thinking that there was something wrong with Black people. I came of age with parents who were nurtured in the Black Power movement just as Malcolm came of age from parents who were nurtured by Marcus Garvey\u2019s UNIA (Universal Negro Improvement Association).\n\nWhere Malcolm became incredibly critical for me, particularly as a scholar, is his constant and routine challenge of what in my work I call assimilationist ideas. These are ideas that Black people hold that essentially everything White is better and that we should seek to essentially become White because to be White is to be better. Malcolm routinely pushed back against those ideas. And it really encouraged Black people to realize that their culture is beautiful. The way they look is beautiful. The way they love is beautiful \u2014 ideas that I have been encouraging Black people to realize through documenting anti-Black racist ideas and pushing back against those of us who\u2019ve internalized those ideas.\n\nSome antiracists have been pretty demoralized by recent events. What can they learn from Malcolm?\n\nPeople can learn how to think, how to organize, and how to be inspired at a moment when they\u2019re no reason to be inspired. Malcolm argued that we should think beyond the construct of civil rights and instead recognize and fight for human rights. In this moment, in the United States and other countries, I think his formulation of human rights \u2014 what we deserve as human beings, no matter what \u2014 is invigorating.\n\nIt can also create mechanisms for multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious organizing, because all of our human rights are being stolen, taken and abused in this moment.\n\nA protester holds up a sign during a demonstration outside City Hall in Houston, Texas, on February 17, 2025. Reginald Mathalone/NurPhoto/AP\n\nAre you surprised at how quickly we went from a racial reckoning four years ago to where we are now?\n\nI am. At the same time, I\u2019m surprised, but I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m surprised because \u2026 like other people who were doing this work, I was hopeful that we had turned a corner as a nation. We were finally going to recognize that racism is harmful for most of us, that we were going to eradicate racism, and that we were going to build a society that was going to be better for the vast majority of Americans.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t happen, I became disappointed and shocked. At the same time, as a student of American history, I\u2019ve constantly documented how racial progress, at least how we hoped to experience it in 2020, is typically met with what I call racist progress, or the progression of racism. And we certainly are experiencing that progression of racism right now.\n\nWhat have the last four years been like for you? In 2020 everyone wanted to hear you speak, and your books were everywhere. Then the backlash hit and you\u2019ve become one of the symbols of the so-called racial reckoning. Have you lost friends, or had speaking engagements dry up?\n\nWell, what\u2019s interesting is that working on this book as I was experiencing the last few years was both devastating and therapeutic. It was devastating because of what I\u2019ve experienced, and others have experienced in this moment, Malcolm X experienced in the early 1960s. As he became more prominent and as his antiracist ideas reached more people, he experienced a bitter backlash against his work. He was constantly misrepresented, in ways that he didn\u2019t even recognize, to undermine his standing with people.\n\nWe\u2019ve experienced all sorts of distortions and misrepresentations and attacks and allegations that were false. Chronicling what Malcolm experienced while being part of a community of people who experienced something similar has been devastating. At the same time, it\u2019s been therapeutic, because whenever you experience something and you realize other people have experienced it across time, it puts what\u2019s happening to you in perspective.\n\nYou once wrote that racism is not an all-powerful deity that cannot be defeated, and that racist ideals are not natural to the human mind. Do you still believe those things?\n\nI do. And I do largely because I\u2019m someone who has studied the origins of racism, and particularly racist ideas, and have tracked their development over the last 500 years. I know and can demonstrate that in the grand scope of human history, race and racism are only a relatively new development. It\u2019s not the case that since humanity has existed, racism has existed. It\u2019s still a largely new phenomenon. And like with anything else humans have created \u2014 if we can create something, we can eliminate it.\n\nJohn Blake is a CNN senior writer and author of the award-winning memoir, \u201cMore Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFor more than two years since the fatal stabbings of four college students in Moscow, Idaho, a wide-ranging gag order has limited the public\u2019s understanding of the case against Bryan Kohberger.\n\nBut witness testimony revealed in a recently unsealed transcript of a court hearing and the hiring of a new attorney are the clearest clues yet as to the defense\u2019s main focus: Challenging the DNA evidence.\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s most important piece of evidence is a DNA sample taken from a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Investigators then used investigative genetic genealogy, or IGG, a forensic field combining DNA analysis with genealogical research, to connect that sample to Kohberger\u2019s family, according to prosecutors. Subsequent DNA testing found Kohberger was a \u201cstatistical match\u201d to the sample, leading to his arrest, according to prosecutors.\n\nTo combat that evidence, his defense team has repeatedly questioned the use, legality and accuracy of the DNA testing done in each step of the process. In a closed hearing last month, testimony from several witnesses raised questions about how investigators had used the DNA sample from the knife sheath to identify Kohberger as a suspect.\n\nFurther, the defense added Bicka Barlow, an attorney specializing in forensic DNA evidence, to its legal team last week, bolstering their expertise on the topic.\n\nBarlow\u2019s hiring was a reflection that the DNA evidence will be crucial, said Misty Marris, an attorney who has closely followed the Kohberger case.\n\n\u201cWithout the DNA there is a very different case,\u201d Marris explained. \u201cIf the jury believes that Kohberger\u2019s DNA was on that knife sheath, it is a huge boon to the prosecution\u2019s case. It is what links Kohberger to the actual crime scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe DNA could make or break the case, and it\u2019s all about what the jury finds to be credible,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliam C. Thompson, a professor emeritus of criminology, law, and society at University of California, Irvine, similarly said Barlow\u2019s hiring signals DNA evidence is \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re hiring her, it means that they\u2019ve decided they have to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt tells me that DNA will be central to this case.\u201d\n\nKohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, faces four counts of first-degree murder in the November 13, 2022, killings of University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, at a home just outside the university\u2019s Moscow campus. A not guilty plea has been entered on his behalf. The trial is set to begin in August. He faces the death penalty if convicted.\n\nNew attorney has forensic DNA background\n\nBicka Barlow speaks during a hearing for Bryan Kohberger on August 18, 2023, at the Latah County Courthouse in Moscow, Idaho. August Frank/Pool/The Lewiston Tribune/AP\n\nKohberger\u2019s defense team had previously worked with Barlow on this case and hired her as an attorney on February 19, according to court filings.\n\nBased in California, Barlow\u2019s career has focused on challenging DNA evidence, both in private practice and for the San Francisco Public Defender\u2019s Office, her website states. She has acted as DNA counsel or as a consultant on DNA evidence in over 200 cases.\n\nLast June, Barlow filed a declaration in support of a defense motion asking the prosecution to turn over IGG evidence. Barlow, at the time a consultant for the defense, explained her role.\n\n\u201cI was requested by counsel in this case to assist in determining the scope of DNA discovery necessary for defending this case, including any genetic genealogy that was used,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe outlined how genetic genealogy works and noted its forensic techniques \u2013 particularly the construction of a family tree \u2013 are not foolproof.\n\n\u201cThe construction of these family trees is highly subjective and is based on the use of public records such as marriage and birth certificates,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDifficulties with tracing a family tree may arise when there are events that sever a relationship, such as an out of wedlock birth, name change, or adoption.\u201d\n\nThe addition of an attorney with DNA expertise will be a \u201cgreat advantage\u201d for Kohberger\u2019s defense, Marris explained.\n\n\u201cBeing able to identify and understand the vulnerabilities with the evidence, speak fluently with the experts that the team will use at trial, and distill complicated concepts to the jury is what the defense must do at trial,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most effective way to do it is a legal team who comes in with that expertise.\u201d\n\nThe use of investigative genetic genealogy has spread widely among law enforcement over the past few years. The technology has been used to crack some of the country\u2019s most frustrating cold cases, most notably the arrest of the Golden State Killer in 2018.\n\nBut genetic genealogy has rarely been tested in a courtroom setting to an intense degree. And questions remain about how investigators obtained and used the forensic technique in this case, as well as how a jury might understand this evidence.\n\nProsecutors usually don\u2019t introduce IGG evidence at trial, said Steve Kramer, a former attorney for the FBI who was among a team of investigators who used genetic genealogy to solve the Golden State Killer case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an identification tool,\u201d said Kramer, who founded Indago Solutions, an IGG company. \u201cIt\u2019s an investigation tool.\u201d\n\nThe importance of the knife sheath DNA\n\nVideo Ad Feedback New details emerge in University of Idaho murder case 03:36 - Source: CNN New details emerge in University of Idaho murder case 03:36\n\nBarlow\u2019s hiring came after a January hearing with several witnesses who spoke about the importance of the DNA testing to the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\nThe hearing stemmed from a defense motion to suppress the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, as the defense argued the testing violated Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights and its results should be thrown out. Judge Steven Hippler denied the defense\u2019s motion, meaning that evidence can be used at trial.\n\nNotably, the testimony revealed that prosecutors only learned about Kohberger due to DNA testing.\n\nInvestigators had found DNA from a single Unknown Male A from a swab of the knife sheath, according to Moscow Police Detective Cpl. Brett Payne. The lab tested samples from the sheath for \u201ctouch DNA\u201d \u2013 which can come in the form of skin cells that are shed on items being touched, said Rylene Nowlin, an Idaho State Police forensic laboratory manager.\n\nThat DNA was key evidence for the prosecution, Payne said.\n\n\u201cThe DNA from the knife sheath was obviously the one thing we had that we thought was a very strong piece of evidence in this case, so it was that particular piece that we pursued as a potential avenue of identifying a suspect,\u201d he said.\n\nIdaho State Police delivered that knife sheath sample to Houston-based Othram laboratory for further testing, Nowlin said. The FBI took over the testing on December 10, and nine days later the FBI presented Idaho investigators with Kohberger\u2019s name for the very first time.\n\n\u201cThat was a result of investigative genetic genealogy that was being undertaken by the FBI,\u201d Payne said. \u201cWe had a phone call that evening, and we were told Bryan Kohberger\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nFrom there, investigators went to Kohberger\u2019s family home in Pennsylvania and pulled items from their trash to test against that knife sheath sample. A DNA profile obtained from the trash was identified as \u201cas not being excluded as the biological father of Suspect knife Profile,\u201d according to court documents. \u201cAt least 99.9998% of the male population would be expected to be excluded from the possibility of being the suspect\u2019s biological father.\u201d\n\nFinally, investigators took a buccal swab from Kohberger, conducted a short tandem repeat (STR) analysis test, and found he was a \u201cstatistical match\u201d with the knife sheath DNA, according to prosecutors. An STR analysis is a common type of DNA profiling in criminal cases, according to the National Institute of Justice.\n\n\u201cIn a field of haystacks, IGG gives you the haystack to look in,\u201d Kramer told CNN. \u201cSTR finds the needle in the haystack.\u201d\n\nMethods and testing will come under questioning\n\nThe hearing revealed that investigators used multiple methods of genetic testing, including touch DNA, STR testing and IGG. Each of those methods has their own scientific uses, processes and reliability, and the defense is likely to probe each aspect for flaws.\n\nWhat exactly is a \u201cstatistical match\u201d? What are the chances of error \u2013 human or otherwise \u2013 in conducting DNA tests and analyzing their results? Did investigators follow all the proper procedures? How relevant or probative is this evidence anyway?\n\nMarris told CNN she believes the defense will work to challenge the methodology of the testing, the results of the testing and the relevance to the case.\n\n\u201cJust because the DNA is coming into the courtroom, the case is not over,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to effectively challenge DNA evidence in a way that regular jury members understand, without getting too technical, said Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, and people can easily get confused,\u201d he said.\n\nIn IGG, a genetic genealogist takes a DNA sample, inputs it into an online database to get potential family matches and then builds out a family tree to find potential suspects. The databases FamilyTreeDNA and GEDMatch PRO allow searching by law enforcement, but others like Ancestry, 23andMe and MyHeritage do not.\n\nIn Kohberger\u2019s case, the FBI uploaded the DNA sample to multiple databases that disallowed law enforcement, the judge said in the ruling last week denying the defense motion to suppress genetic information. While that is seemingly a violation of both the FBI\u2019s own internal policy and the databases\u2019 terms of service, the judge noted the policy was merely \u201cinternal guidance\u201d and any alleged violation \u201cis not of constitutional importance.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the FBI for a response to the accusation that it used a genealogical database inappropriately. Prosecutors did not directly respond to that claim during the hearing.\n\nKramer emphasized there was \u201cno violation of law in how the FBI used those databases\u201d as investigators can \u201cuse undercover techniques, including going undercover to genealogy sites where the public has no expectation of privacy or where they have agreed to match with everybody, and that includes law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you have a case like this, where four people are apparently randomly murdered and butchered to death in their home and the killer is unidentified, not just FBI but all of law enforcement, is going out and using every available technique they have whether it be phone data, GPS data, video data, DNA data to solve the case,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nSeparately, the defense is likely to dig into how closely investigators examined other evidence.\n\nAt last month\u2019s hearing, the defense closely questioned Payne, the lead detective in the case, about blood on a handrail between the first and second floors of the home connected to \u201cUnknown Male B.\u201d Payne said they did not pursue that person because, \u201cWe had already received Mr. Kohberger\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from what my understanding was, entering another DNA profile into CODIS would remove the previous one we had from the knife sheath,\u201d he said. CODIS is the nationwide Combined DNA Index System, which includes DNA profiles of convicted offenders, unsolved crime scene evidence and missing people.\n\n\u201cSo if memory serves, the discussion was we\u2019ll hold off, we\u2019ll stay with the one from the knife sheath; if we need to, we can address the Unknown Male B at a later time,\u201d Payne testified.\n\nThe defense also raised the issue of blood on gloves found outside the house connected to \u201cUnknown Male D,\u201d which Payne acknowledged.\n\nIt was not clear from the transcript of the hearing whether the detective pursued the identity of Unknown Male B or Unknown Male D at a later time.",

                "text": "Jefferson City, Missouri CNN \u2014\n\nA bill before the Missouri State Senate would introduce $1,000 rewards for people identifying undocumented immigrants who are then taken into custody.\n\nThe proposal would make it a state felony for anyone in the US illegally to enter and stay in Missouri. It would create an opportunity for licensed bond agents to become bounty hunters. And it would create a fund not just for the bounty hunters, but anyone who provides information on an undocumented individual that results in their arrest.\n\nSenate Bill 72 is still in committee and may never become law. But opponents say it\u2019s already spreading fear and changing the lives of both legally residing and undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hateful,\u201d Ashley Chavarria told CNN. Chavarria is the US-born daughter of two Mexicans who came across the border illegally in the late 1980s and have stayed ever since. She said she\u2019s already seen Latinos, some undocumented, in Missouri\u2019s capital Jefferson City area staying away from English classes and even afraid to collect their children from school since the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the onset of his mass deportation drive.\n\nAnd the new bill could make things worse, added Chavarria, who works at a social service agency for Hispanic communities made up of both citizens and non-citizens. \u201cIt\u2019s actually going to put more fear into people and turn people against each other,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley Chavarria says she struggles to to explain the current political situation to her children, aged 8 and 9. CNN\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, freshman state Sen. David Gregory took time to criticize what he said had been misinformation about his plan both when introducing the legislation and in a short interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing things like \u2018oh, this places a bounty on people.\u2019 No, it doesn\u2019t\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJust because we\u2019re dispatching bounty hunters after a warrant has been issued is not a bounty. It\u2019s actually a reward system through a hotline.\u201d\n\nThe bill creates a felony of \u201ctrespass by an illegal alien\u201d if an undocumented immigrant enters and stays in the state.\n\nThe text of the bill talks of setting up a toll-free phone line, email address and online portal where people could \u2014 anonymously if they wish \u2014 report suspected violators.\n\nIf an undocumented immigrant \u201cis arrested and imprisoned\u2026as a result of a report to the information system, the person who made the report shall be eligible to receive a reward of $1,000,\u201d it says.\n\nGregory insists that incentive is a reward \u2014 similar to those offered by local and national law enforcement agencies seeking information on crimes \u2014 and not a \u201cbounty.\u201d\n\nMerriam-Webster defines \u201cbounty\u201d as \u201ca reward, premium, or subsidy especially when offered or given by a government: such as \u201ca payment for the capture of or assistance in the capture of an outlaw.\u201d\n\nIn the bill, the punishment for violating the \u201ctrespass by illegal alien\u201d felony is life imprisonment without parole, though it says someone could be released to the custody of the federal government if they were going to be deported within 24 hours. Gregory, who represents parts of St. Louis, told CNN he had heard opposition to the life term and was discussing it with fellow senators.\n\nA separate bill he introduced said a court may conditionally release a defendant charged with the state trespassing felony during their initial court appearance if it \u201cfinds that the defendant is seeking asylum and does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d However, if a \u201ccourt finds that the defendant is seeking asylum but poses a danger to the community, the defendant shall be denied bail entirely,\u201d and remain in custody throughout the course of their trial, the bill states. The bill would only go into effect if Senate Bill 72 became law.\n\nGregory emphasized people would only be approached and detained after an investigation finds evidence against them and a warrant is issued by a judge.\n\n\u201cThese concerns we\u2019re hearing that bounty hunters are just going to be kicking in doors, that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s illegal now, it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d Gregory told CNN.\n\nState Sen. David Gregory, left, photographed speaking to CNN's Omar Jimenez, said there has been misinformation about his bill. CNN\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m hearing other types of harassment concerns or things like normal, everyday citizens walking up and saying, \u2018hey, you show me your papers,\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s illegal today. And it\u2019s illegal under my bill,\u201d he said.\n\nThose concerns were raised by some of the dozens of people who spoke against the bill during a senate committee hearing.\n\n\u201cThis bill would not only tear apart families, schools and congregations and communities, but also pit neighbors against one another,\u201d said Yazmin Bruno-Valdez, who introduced herself as a longtime Missouri resident, community advocate and \u201cDreamer\u201d who was brought to the US as a child and is currently allowed to remain.\n\nImmigration and civil rights attorney Javad Khazaeli told CNN Gregory\u2019s stated intention could be overrun if the bill becomes law.\n\n\u201cWhen you put bounties on people, you\u2019re incentivizing grabbing people,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd when you grab people, bad things happen.\u201d\n\nKhazaeli, who\u2019s based in St. Louis, spent a decade as a federal government lawyer advising officers in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies about immigration law. He was aware of times when local law enforcement officers would seek training on immigration regulations as they targeted a specific safety problem. But even with training, there would almost inevitably be problems, he said.\n\n\u201cWe saw issues where local law enforcement officers were arresting Puerto Ricans because they thought Puerto Rico wasn\u2019t part of America. Every time you have any kind of interaction like this, the only possible way for the person on the other end who\u2019s being harassed to get out of it is by showing their papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow this is exactly \u2014 and I\u2019m not trying to be hyperbolic here \u2014 but this is exactly what we had in Nazi Germany,\u201d he added.\n\nThat being said, it could be surprising that the lone voice from a member of the public supporting Gregory\u2019s bill in committee came from Rabbi Ze\u2019ev Smason.\n\nSmason, a rabbi in St Louis for 25 years, rejected the comparisons to the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly were they doing in Nazi Germany? They were turning in neighbors if they had a 16th of Jewish blood within them and then they took them in cattle cars and they exterminated them. That\u2019s what was done in Nazi Germany. Is that what\u2019s being done over here?\u201d he asked.\n\nRabbi Ze'ev Smason was the lone voice speaking in favor of the bill at a public session. . CNN\n\n\u201cI see no reasonable comparison between the two,\u201d he added.\n\nHe told CNN it was a matter of justice. \u201cI think people, even though we\u2019re not a border state, are very concerned about illegal immigration \u2026 because it\u2019s an abrogation of the law and, in general, a spirit of lawlessness is something that\u2019s destructive to our community and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMistakes could be made, he conceded, but he trusted in the judicial system. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that most of the time our police and our courts get it right,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyer Khazaeli said the publicity around Gregory\u2019s bill has already had a chilling effect, even on immigrants with legal status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing people who\u2019ve been in this country for decades, legally, terrified,\u201d he said, mentioning one woman from Europe who had been a legal permanent resident for 30 years, now looking to become a citizen because she was afraid of what could happen.\n\nAt the state capitol, Gregory said: \u201cMy intention is to make sure that we, as a state, can step up \u2026 and protect our women and our children and our Missourians from the dangerous immigrants. I\u2019m sorry that that scares them but that is not the intent.\u201d\n\nHe said he was optimistic the bill would pass but that it would take time.\n\nIf the senate progresses the bill, it will go to the state House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson wrote, \u201cI have not heard any enthusiasm from House Republicans about doing any bounty hunter legislation. We are pleased that President Donald Trump is addressing illegal immigration at the federal level, including by signing the Laken Riley Act, which enables states to work with the federal government on immigration.\u201d\n\nA similar bill put forward by the Mississippi Legislature was killed in early February.\n\nThat bill had many of the hallmarks of Missouri Senate Bill 72 including: a $1,000 reward for tips that led to the arrest of undocumented immigrants, the creation of a \u201ccertified bounty hunter\u201d program, and also the threat of life in prison.\n\nJavad Khazaeli, an immigration and civil rights attorney, said he was ready to sue if SB72 passed and people were detained illegally. CNN\n\nThe American Immigration Council estimated there were nearly 70,000 undocumented immigrants living in Missouri. State Attorney General Andrew Bailey said there were up to about 100,000.\n\nThey include Chavarria\u2019s parents, who Chavarria said currently have work permits but are also in the process of trying to legalize their status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my parents asking for a handout,\u201d Chavarria said, rejecting some narratives used against migrants.\n\nChavarria also said she wanted criminals off the streets whatever their citizenship, as did the people she knew. \u201cThe right immigrants know that we have to respect a country that we\u2019re not citizens of,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re aware of that and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nNow with children of her own, she has at times struggled to explain this moment in American politics. They\u2019re 8 and 9 years old.\n\n\u201cThey tell me that the kids in school will scream \u2018Trump, Trump, Trump\u2019, and I tell them like, well, that\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cI do try to let them know just to always be proud of who they are,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go very in depth with them because they don\u2019t understand,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe system is way broken,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we could put the effort that we\u2019re putting into deporting all these immigrants, I wish that that effort could go into fixing that system, setting it up to where there\u2019s an actual pathway to citizenship or residency,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nBut for this bill and this moment, Khazaeli said he and other lawyers were ready.\n\n\u201cIf they push this forward, we\u2019re just going to sue them and we\u2019re going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to start arresting people that they have no right to arrest, they\u2019re going to start detaining people that they have no right to detain.\u201d\n\nHe said he was concerned that even if the \u201cbounty\u201d part of the bill got dropped, other measures he sees as too extreme could pass.\n\n\u201cThis could happen in Missouri, and we\u2019re preparing for that.\u201d",

Hernandez eventually stopped. Officers found a black pull-tie bag nearby with individually wrapped bags of meth, which they allege was ditched by Hernandez as he was coming to a stop. Officers report that Hernandez admitted to coming from the E. Spruce St. house. He was arrested for eluding officers, intent to deliver a controlled substance, driving without privileges, and paraphernalia.\n\nOfficers were able to use Hernandez's arrest to obtain a search warrant for the home on E.

Recently, the trend has been the scammer texting the victim and claiming they are a recruiter with a job opportunity. The scammer often asks the victim to fill out an \"application\" online and/or requests money that they claim will be repaid, according to the media release.\n\nIn a recent Denver case, the victim explained to police that they were contacted by several different online companies and for each of the companies, the victim was asked to pay upfront with the company saying they would reimburse the victim, DPD said. The victim was asked to send $500 through cryptocurrency and the \"employer\" said they would pay the victim $3,000, but they didn't pay them back, according to the media release.\n\nIn another incident, the victim was paid $200 for training and was told to buy a certain amount of cryptocurrency, police said. The scammer said the victim would be paid double for their work, but were paid nothing. The \"company\" also requested the victim to fill out tax forms, like I-9 and 1090 form, to send back to them, the media release says. They also requested the victim download software onto their computer and phone for communication with the employer.\n\nThe total financial loss for this victim was $8,700, according to police.\n\nWith these type of scams, the scammers not only steal money, but they now have access to victims' personal information that can further impact them financially.\n\nWhen looking for online jobs, red flags that could indicate a potential scam according to the Federal Trade Commission include:\n\nRequests for upfront payment\n\nAsking for sensitive personal information too early\n\nOverly vague job descriptions\n\nA company with little or no online presence\n\nPressure to sign up quickly\n\nPromises of unrealistic earnings\n\nCommunication solely through email or text with no phone contact option",

                "text": "Londres CNN \u2014\n\nOccidente est\u00e1 en una \u201cencrucijada de la historia\u201d, dijo el primer ministro del Reino Unido, Keir Starmer, a los l\u00edderes europeos en una cumbre crucial en Londres este domingo, mientras el continente buscaba arrebatarle a Estados Unidos el control de las negociaciones sobre la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania y presentar un frente unido en medio de un colapso en las relaciones entre Kyiv y Washington.\n\n\u201cEste no es un momento para m\u00e1s conversaciones. Es hora de actuar\u201d, dijo Starmer despu\u00e9s de un d\u00eda monumental de diplomacia en Londres, en el que los l\u00edderes del continente intentaron forjar un camino hacia un alto el fuego en Ucrania.\n\nLa urgencia de la cumbre en la ornamentada Lancaster House de Londres se intensific\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump reprendiera a Zelensky en la Oficina Oval, horrorizando a Occidente y deleitando a Mosc\u00fa en el proceso. Zelensky y un conjunto de l\u00edderes europeos asistieron, en un momento de intensa ansiedad en el conflicto.\n\nStarmer dijo a los periodistas que estaba trabajando con Francia y un peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de otras naciones para elaborar un plan para detener los combates, que luego se presentar\u00eda a Estados Unidos.\n\nEl proceso parece destinado a rivalizar con el proceso de negociaci\u00f3n que la administraci\u00f3n de Trump abri\u00f3 con Rusia el mes pasado, y sugiere una aceptaci\u00f3n t\u00e1cita de que llevar a Trump y Zelensky a la mesa de negociaciones juntos podr\u00eda resultar en que las tensiones estallen una vez m\u00e1s.\n\nLa presidenta de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea, Ursula von der Leyen, el presidente de Finlandia, Alexander Stubb, el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, el primer ministro de Gran Breta\u00f1a, Keir Starmer, el presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, el presidente interino de Rumania, Ilie Bolojan, el presidente del Consejo Europeo, Antonio Costa, y el primer ministro de Canad\u00e1, Justin Trudeau, comienzan una reuni\u00f3n plenaria en Lancaster House durante la cumbre de l\u00edderes europeos el 2 de marzo de 2025 en Londres, Inglaterra. WPA Pool/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nPero a\u00fan requerir\u00eda el apoyo estadounidense, reiter\u00f3 Starmer nuevamente durante una conferencia de prensa el domingo. Insisti\u00f3 en que Estados Unidos \u201cno es un aliado poco confiable\u201d despu\u00e9s de que la extraordinaria discusi\u00f3n de Trump con Zelensky asustara profundamente a Europa.\n\nOccidente esperar\u00e1 que la cumbre del domingo haya revivido el impulso en un proceso de paz que parec\u00eda estar construy\u00e9ndose lentamente esta semana, solo para derrumbarse en esos desagradables minutos del viernes. Mostr\u00f3 la unidad europea, y varios l\u00edderes presentes intentaron corregir la narrativa de que el continente era un espectador en las negociaciones para poner fin a la guerra.\n\n\u201cAl final, un acuerdo tendr\u00e1 que involucrar a Rusia, por supuesto que s\u00ed, pero no podemos abordarlo sobre la base de que Rusia dicta los t\u00e9rminos de cualquier garant\u00eda de seguridad antes de que siquiera lleguemos a un acuerdo; de lo contrario, no haremos ning\u00fan progreso en absoluto\u201d, dijo Starmer.\n\nEl Reino Unido y Francia han estado tratando de formar una \u201ccoalici\u00f3n de los dispuestos\u201d que entrar\u00eda en Ucrania despu\u00e9s de que se alcanzara un acuerdo. \u201cSi se llega a un acuerdo, tiene que ser un acuerdo que luego se defienda\u201d, dijo Starmer.\n\n\u201cNadie quiere ver eso\u201d\n\nEl espect\u00e1culo previo del presidente y vicepresidente de Estados Unidos en el que reprendieron al l\u00edder de un aliado devastado por la guerra a\u00f1adi\u00f3 intensidad a la cumbre de este domingo, que inicialmente hab\u00eda sido convocada por Starmer para construir sobre el progreso logrado durante una reuni\u00f3n similar en Par\u00eds el fin de semana pasado.\n\nTrump y J.D. Vance acusaron a Zelensky de ser ingrato por el apoyo militar estadounidense, de \u201cjugar con las vidas de millones de personas\u201d y de arriesgarse a una \u201cTercera Guerra Mundial\u201d al luchar contra el ej\u00e9rcito invasor de Rusia en su pa\u00eds.\n\nLa escena fue la peor pesadilla de Europa. \u201cNadie quiere ver eso\u201d, dijo Starmer a la BBC este domingo. Dijo que \u201cse puso al tel\u00e9fono\u201d tan pronto como vio la furiosa discusi\u00f3n, y agreg\u00f3: \u201cMi prop\u00f3sito principal ha sido cerrar esta brecha\u201d.\n\nStarmer dio una bienvenida amistosa a Zelensky el s\u00e1bado. Temilade Adelaja/Reuters\n\nUn d\u00eda antes del acalorado encuentro, un amistoso Starmer consigui\u00f3 que Trump se retractara de sus falsos comentarios anteriores de que Zelensky era un \u201cdictador\u201d, expresara su \u201crespeto\u201d por el l\u00edder ucraniano e incluso planteara la posibilidad de que Ucrania recuperara territorio ocupado por Rusia en un acuerdo de alto el fuego. Todos esos comentarios fueron notables retrocesos de Trump, y la situaci\u00f3n parec\u00eda preparar bien la mesa para el viaje de Zelensky.\n\nAhora Europa vuelve a empezar desde cero.\n\n\u201cTres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de la brutal invasi\u00f3n rusa de Ucrania, nos encontramos en un punto de inflexi\u00f3n. Hoy reafirmar\u00e9 mi apoyo inquebrantable a Ucrania y redoblar\u00e9 mi compromiso de proporcionar capacidad, formaci\u00f3n y ayuda a Ucrania, coloc\u00e1ndola en la posici\u00f3n m\u00e1s fuerte posible\u201d, dijo Starmer en un comunicado antes de la cumbre de Londres.\n\n\u201cUn momento \u00fanico en una generaci\u00f3n\u201d\n\n\u201cNos reunimos aqu\u00ed hoy porque este es un momento \u00fanico en una generaci\u00f3n para la seguridad de Europa y todos necesitamos dar un paso adelante,\u201d dijo Starmer a los l\u00edderes al inaugurar la cumbre de este domingo.\n\nLa cumbre tendr\u00e1 tres objetivos, dijo Downing Street: las necesidades a corto plazo de Ucrania, asegurar un \u201cacuerdo duradero\u201d para poner fin al conflicto, y \u201cplanificar s\u00f3lidas garant\u00edas de seguridad\u201d.\n\n\u201cEspero que sepas que todos estamos contigo y con el pueblo de Ucrania durante el tiempo que sea necesario, todos alrededor de esta mesa\u201d, dijo Starmer a Zelensky durante sus comentarios de apertura.\n\nStarmer y Macron hablan en la cumbre del domingo. Toby Melville/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEl presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, el l\u00edder saliente de Canad\u00e1 Justin Trudeau, y los jefes de varios pa\u00edses europeos, la Uni\u00f3n Europea y la OTAN est\u00e1n todos presentes.\n\nLa primera ministra de Italia, Giorgia Meloni, le dijo a Starmer este domingo que es \u201cmuy, muy importante que evitemos el riesgo de que Occidente se divida\u201d por la guerra en Ucrania.\n\nAmbos l\u00edderes pueden resultar vitales para encauzar un proceso de paz; ambos han desarrollado fuertes relaciones con Trump y se espera que utilicen esa influencia para convencer al presidente de escuchar las propuestas de Europa.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As\u00ed apoy\u00f3 Europa a Zelensky tras acalorada discusi\u00f3n con Trump 01:53 - Fuente: CNN As\u00ed apoy\u00f3 Europa a Zelensky tras acalorada discusi\u00f3n con Trump 01:53\n\nCatherine Nicholls y Svitlana Vlasova de CNN contribuyeron a esta historia.",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nEl Gobierno de Trump est\u00e1 intensificando el control sobre la inmigraci\u00f3n \u2014legal e ilegal\u2014 sentando las bases para posibles faltas de mano de obra, un crecimiento econ\u00f3mico m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil y una mayor inflaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump anunci\u00f3 una serie de pol\u00edticas de inmigraci\u00f3n inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de asumir el cargo a finales de enero, muchas de las cuales est\u00e1n destinadas a frenar las entradas ilegales, un principio fundamental de su campa\u00f1a presidencial. Pero tambi\u00e9n ha limitado las v\u00edas legales, como cerrar el proceso de solicitud de asilo en la frontera entre EE.UU. y M\u00e9xico y cancelar vuelos para refugiados que ya hab\u00edan sido verificados.\n\n\u201cLa realidad es que dependemos de la mano de obra inmigrante en este pa\u00eds y las pol\u00edticas de Trump podr\u00edan tener enormes consecuencias para muchas industrias\u201d, dijo Jorge Loweree, director ejecutivo de programas en el American Immigration Council, a CNN.\n\nEn el pasado, Trump ha dicho que dar\u00eda la bienvenida a los inmigrantes legales, al afirmar que \u201ctenemos que tener a personas de calidad entrando\u201d en su segundo d\u00eda en el cargo. La semana pasada, present\u00f3 un programa de visa de \u201ctarjeta dorada\u201d para extranjeros adinerados que deseen vivir y trabajar en EE.UU.\n\nSin embargo, varios expertos dicen a CNN que se espera que la inmigraci\u00f3n legal disminuya durante el segundo mandato de Trump, ya que su Gobierno fomenta un ambiente hostil para los inmigrantes a trav\u00e9s de sus pol\u00edticas y mensajes, lo que podr\u00eda llevar a una menor cantidad de trabajadores disponibles en diversas industrias y una mayor inflaci\u00f3n. Ya hay se\u00f1ales de que la inmigraci\u00f3n legal se est\u00e1 desacelerando.\n\n\u201cHa estado sorprendentemente tranquilo\u201d, dijo Melissa Lopez, abogada y directora ejecutiva de la firma de servicios legales de inmigraci\u00f3n Estrella Del Paso, a CNN. \u201cHe estado haciendo esto durante 17 a\u00f1os y medio aqu\u00ed en El Paso, y esto se siente bajo\u201d.\n\nA medida que los estadounidenses tienen menos hijos, su poblaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 empezando a envejecer. Eso significa que la industria de la salud est\u00e1 cada vez m\u00e1s desesperada por trabajadores que cuiden a los ancianos. Y las industrias que dependen de personas m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, incluida la construcci\u00f3n y la agricultura, necesitan personal.\n\nLos economistas dicen que la inmigraci\u00f3n es la soluci\u00f3n que necesita la econom\u00eda de Estados Unidos. Ese es un dilema, porque la Casa Blanca dice que la inmigraci\u00f3n es el problema.\n\n\u00bfMenos inmigrantes legales en el futuro?\n\nLa inmigraci\u00f3n legal a Estados Unidos disminuy\u00f3 en 2020 debido a las restricciones de la era de la pandemia, pero aument\u00f3 dr\u00e1sticamente en los a\u00f1os siguientes.\n\nEl a\u00f1o pasado, aproximadamente 2,8 millones de personas inmigraron legalmente a Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan la Oficina del Censo. Eso incluye refugiados y aquellos que ingresan al pa\u00eds a trav\u00e9s de visas de trabajo, lo que representa el 84% del crecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en 2024.\n\nUn informe del Cato Institute, de tendencia conservadora, publicado el mes pasado argument\u00f3 que el alto nivel de inmigraci\u00f3n actual le da a Trump \u201cm\u00e1s margen para implementar restricciones\u201d mientras intenta \u201capaciguar a su base nativista y a la clase pol\u00edtica nacionalista reduciendo la inmigraci\u00f3n legal\u201d.\n\n\u201cEspero que veamos m\u00e1s restricciones para el verano\u201d, dijo David Bier, director de estudios de inmigraci\u00f3n en el Cato Institute. El Gobierno de Trump est\u00e1 considerando invocar una orden de salud p\u00fablica que etiquete a los migrantes en la frontera sur que solicitan asilo como riesgos para la propagaci\u00f3n de enfermedades, un poder que los funcionarios usaron durante la pandemia para cerrar la frontera.\n\nAllianz Trade pronostica que la inmigraci\u00f3n legal se reducir\u00e1 casi a la mitad para 2026. Junto con las deportaciones masivas, esa desaceleraci\u00f3n en la inmigraci\u00f3n podr\u00eda hacer que el crecimiento de la poblaci\u00f3n caiga un 0,2% ese a\u00f1o.\n\nJennifer Babaie, directora de defensa y servicios legales en Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, dijo que espera que \u201csea mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil para las personas solicitar cualquier cosa\u201d en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os, lo que finalmente reducir\u00e1 el n\u00famero de personas que logran inmigrar legalmente a Estados Unidos.\n\n\u201cEsperamos retrasos, tanto porque el personal en el tribunal ha disminuido como porque el personal y la financiaci\u00f3n de inmigraci\u00f3n y aduanas est\u00e1n en riesgo\u201d, dijo Babaie. \u201cTambi\u00e9n estamos pasando horas en detenci\u00f3n tratando de entrevistar a personas para entender qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo porque no estamos recibiendo informaci\u00f3n ni cooperaci\u00f3n de la administraci\u00f3n, y eso reduce el tiempo que podr\u00edamos estar trabajando en un alegato complicado\u201d.\n\nEl impacto econ\u00f3mico de la represi\u00f3n de Trump\n\nHab\u00eda 47,8 millones de inmigrantes en Estados Unidos en 2023, con un total de US$ 1,7 billones en poder adquisitivo y que pagaron alrededor de US$ 652.000 millones en impuestos, seg\u00fan el American Immigration Council. Ese poder econ\u00f3mico est\u00e1 en riesgo debido a la agenda de inmigraci\u00f3n de Trump.\n\nEl pron\u00f3stico de Allianz Trade estima que la represi\u00f3n de Trump sobre la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal y legal podr\u00eda hacer que el PIB caiga a una tasa de crecimiento anualizada de menos del 2% para 2026. La Instituci\u00f3n Brookings estima que el crecimiento podr\u00eda ser 0,4 puntos porcentuales m\u00e1s bajo este a\u00f1o, si Trump contin\u00faa restringiendo la inmigraci\u00f3n legal y logra llevar a cabo 3,4 millones de deportaciones. En la campa\u00f1a, Trump dijo que quiere deportar \u201cprobablemente a 15 millones y tal vez hasta 20 millones\u201d de personas, lo que ser\u00eda una tarea complicada y costosa.\n\nLos inmigrantes constituyen m\u00e1s del 20% del empleo en agricultura, construcci\u00f3n, transporte, almacenamiento, servicios generales y servicios de desechos, estima el American Immigration Council. Eso significa que se espera que los empleadores en esas industrias est\u00e9n en apuros a medida que Trump avanza con las deportaciones masivas y limita la inmigraci\u00f3n legal.\n\n\u201cEstas industrias tienen mercados laborales muy ajustados, por lo que ser muy restrictivo y agresivo en inmigraci\u00f3n no le dar\u00e1 a Trump ese crecimiento econ\u00f3mico y \u00e9xito que desea\u201d, dijo Giovanni Peri, profesor de econom\u00eda en la Universidad de California, Davis, que estudia la intersecci\u00f3n de la inmigraci\u00f3n y el trabajo.\n\nPeri dijo que las escaseces de mano de obra, impulsadas por una represi\u00f3n de la inmigraci\u00f3n, podr\u00edan resultar en un aumento de precios para alimentos, vivienda y turismo. Agreg\u00f3 que la mano de obra inmigrante es esencial tambi\u00e9n debido a los cambios demogr\u00e1ficos del pa\u00eds.\n\n\u201cEn una situaci\u00f3n en la que habr\u00e1 muchos m\u00e1s estadounidenses jubilados, m\u00e1s inmigraci\u00f3n realmente beneficiar\u00eda al mercado laboral y al crecimiento de la econom\u00eda\u201d, dijo Peri.",

                "text": "CNN Espa\u00f1ol \u2014\n\nEnrique \u201cKiki \u201cCamarena era un agente encubierto de la DEA que se hab\u00eda instalado junto a su mujer y sus tres hijos en M\u00e9xico. Su objetivo era encarcelar a los l\u00edderes de los incipientes carteles y detener el flujo de la droga que llegaba a Estados Unidos. En 1985 fue torturado y asesinado en Guadalajara, en manos del cartel liderado por Rafael Caro Quintero. Entre las pertenencias que su familia hered\u00f3 se encontraban unas esposas que el agente hab\u00eda utilizado durante sus a\u00f1os de servicio. Nadie hubiese imaginado que, 40 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, ser\u00edan utilizadas para un \u00faltimo gran arresto.\n\nLa familia Camarena lidera una fundaci\u00f3n en honor a Kiki, con el objetivo de erradicar el abuso de drogas entre los j\u00f3venes estadounidenses y para \u201chonrar a los h\u00e9roes fallecidos y a los heridos en la lucha en contra de las drogas ilegales\u201d.\n\nTras conocerse que Caro Quintero ser\u00eda juzgado en Estados Unidos, compartieron un emotivo mensaje en las redes oficiales de la fundaci\u00f3n:\n\n\u201cHoy es un d\u00eda que hemos esperado por mucho tiempo. Cuarenta largos a\u00f1os de espera, pregunt\u00e1ndonos y con la esperanza de que finalmente llegar\u00eda la justicia. Despu\u00e9s de cuatro d\u00e9cadas, la persona responsable de quitarle a nuestro amado Kiki ha sido tra\u00edda a los Estados Unidos para responder por lo que hizo.\n\nNo hay palabras para describir completamente el dolor que hemos soportado: la silla vac\u00eda en la mesa, los cumplea\u00f1os y las fiestas sin \u00e9l. La vida que fue robada, no solo de \u00e9l, sino de todos nosotros que lo am\u00e1bamos. Hemos vivido con esta p\u00e9rdida cada d\u00eda.\n\nDurante 14.631 d\u00edas mantuvimos la esperanza \u2014esperanza de que este momento llegar\u00eda \u2014. Esperanza de que vivir\u00edamos para ver la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas. Y, ahora, esa esperanza finalmente se ha convertido en realidad. Aunque ning\u00fan tiempo puede borrar el dolor o traer de vuelta lo que perdimos, hoy marca un paso hacia la justicia.\n\nEl agente de la DEA Kiki Camarena. Imagen de archivo. Cr\u00e9dito: DEA\n\nQueremos agradecer a la DEA, a las agencias de aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley, a los investigadores y a los funcionarios \u2014tanto en Estados Unidos como en el extranjero\u2014que nunca se rindieron.\n\nQueremos agradecer al presidente Trump por usar el peso de este pa\u00eds para lograr lo que pensamos que nunca ocurrir\u00eda. Gracias a todos los que han trabajado en este caso durante 40 a\u00f1os. No los conocemos a todos, pero por favor sepan que tienen el m\u00e1s profundo agradecimiento y aprecio de nuestra familia.\n\nA aquellos que han estado a nuestro lado, nos han apoyado, han celebrado con nosotros la Semana de la Cinta Roja (nota del editor: programa en contra del abuso de drogas) y nos han acompa\u00f1ado en los momentos m\u00e1s oscuros \u2014nuestra familia extendida, amigos e incluso extra\u00f1os que han compartido nuestro duelo\u2014 estamos eternamente agradecidos\u201d.\n\nEl brutal asesinato de Kiki Camarena signific\u00f3 el comienzo del fin del cartel de Guadalajara. Rafael Caro Quintero comenz\u00f3 a ser buscado por la justicia. Se escondi\u00f3 en Costa Rica, pero fue capturado y extraditado a M\u00e9xico. Fue condenado a 40 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n, hasta que en 2013 un tribunal estatal anul\u00f3 el juicio. Qued\u00f3 en libertad por poco tiempo, porque un tribunal federal orden\u00f3 su captura. Entonces, volvi\u00f3 a darse a la fuga. Esta vez, consigui\u00f3 eludir a la ley durante varios a\u00f1os. En 2016, desde la clandestinidad, otorg\u00f3 una entrevista a la revista Proceso donde admiti\u00f3 haber estado en el lugar de la muerte del agente estadounidense, pero neg\u00f3 haberla ordenado. Finalmente, en 2022 fue apresado. En medio de un operativo de la Marina de M\u00e9xico, un perro lo encontr\u00f3 escondido entre unos matorrales.\n\nPara la Administraci\u00f3n de Control de Drogas de Estados Unidos (DEA, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), la muerte de Camarena marc\u00f3 un antes y un despu\u00e9s. En un comunicado oficial del organismo, Derek Malts, administrador interino, resumi\u00f3 ese sentir:\n\n\u201cRafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero, un jefe de cartel que desat\u00f3 violencia, destrucci\u00f3n y muerte en Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico, ha pasado cuatro d\u00e9cadas en la lista de fugitivos m\u00e1s buscados por la DEA, y hoy podemos decir con orgullo que ha llegado a Estados Unidos, donde se har\u00e1 justicia. Este momento es extremadamente personal para los hombres y mujeres de la DEA que creen que Caro Quintero es responsable de la brutal tortura y asesinato del agente especial de la DEA Enrique \u2018Kiki\u2019 Camarena. Tambi\u00e9n es una victoria para la familia Camarena. Hoy se env\u00eda un mensaje a cada l\u00edder de cartel, a cada traficante, a cada criminal que envenena nuestras comunidades: tendr\u00e1s que rendir cuentas. No importa cu\u00e1nto tiempo tome, no importa cu\u00e1n lejos corras, la justicia te encontrar\u00e1\u201d.\n\nEl juez Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena Jr. entrega las esposas de su padre al exagente de la DEA Steve Paris, quien las llev\u00f3 a Nueva York para coloc\u00e1rselas a Rafael Caro Quintero durante su comparecencia ante la corte. Fotograf\u00eda obtenida de X: @illicitinv\n\nDurante sus 11 a\u00f1os como agente, Enrique Camarena recibi\u00f3 dos Premios de Desempe\u00f1o Superior Sostenido, un Premio de Logros Especiales y, p\u00f3stumamente, el Premio de Honor del Administrador, el reconocimiento m\u00e1s importante del organismo.\n\nUno de los tres hijos de Kiki, Enrique Camarena Jr., es juez de la corte suprema del condado de San Diego, en California desde 2014. En un mensaje grabado con motivo de la celebraci\u00f3n de la semana de la Cinta Roja, un programa en contra del abuso de drogas creado tras la inspiraci\u00f3n que despert\u00f3 su padre, as\u00ed lo recordaba:\n\n\u201cEl nombre de mi padre era Enrique Camarena, el mismo que el m\u00edo. \u00c9l es un h\u00e9roe estadounidense. Muri\u00f3 por su pa\u00eds. Y, aunque tal vez no lo sepan, tuvo un impacto en sus vidas o en las vidas de sus hijos. Su muerte cambi\u00f3 el rumbo de c\u00f3mo Estados Unidos trata a aquellos que traen drogas ilegales al pa\u00eds. Mi padre era un agente de la DEA. Yo ten\u00eda 11 a\u00f1os cuando mi pap\u00e1 fue asesinado\u201d.\n\nJane Rosenberg\n\nEnrique Camarena Jr. fue quien entreg\u00f3 las esposas de su padre a un exagente de la DEA para que fueran trasladadas a Nueva York.\n\nCaro Quintero ingres\u00f3 encadenado al juzgado donde se decidir\u00e1 su destino. Vistiendo un uniforme de prisionero azul, el llamado \u201cnarco de narcos\u201d requiri\u00f3 de un int\u00e9rprete durante su presentaci\u00f3n ante el tribunal. Se declar\u00f3 inocente de los cargos de los cuales se lo acusa. El metal que rodeaba sus mu\u00f1ecas estaba intervenido por un grabado muy especial: \u201cCamarena\u201d.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump, conocido por sus planes de deportaci\u00f3n masiva, propuso la semana pasada una nueva forma de atraer a extranjeros ricos a EE.UU.: una \u201ctarjeta dorada\u201d que ofrece a los inversores una v\u00eda hacia la ciudadan\u00eda estadounidense por US$ 5 millones.\n\n\u201cCreo que va a ser muy apreciada. Creo que va a ir muy bien. Y vamos a empezar a vender, con suerte, en unas dos semanas\u201d, dijo el presidente Donald Trump el mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nEl secretario de Comercio, Howard Lutnick, dijo que el plan podr\u00eda recaudar un bill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares para pagar la deuda nacional, y que reemplazar\u00eda al actual visado para inversores EB-5.\n\nEl anuncio desde el Despacho Oval tom\u00f3 por sorpresa a muchos expertos en inmigraci\u00f3n, que dicen que la propuesta de la \u201ctarjeta dorada\u201d es mucho m\u00e1s complicada e incierta de lo que Trump y Lutnick hicieron parecer. He aqu\u00ed varias razones:\n\nEl presidente no puede crear una visa nueva por s\u00ed mismo\n\nLa tarjeta dorada descrita por Trump ser\u00eda un nuevo visado que conceder\u00eda el estatus de residente permanente legal en EE.UU. y una v\u00eda hacia la ciudadan\u00eda. Pero un presidente por s\u00ed solo no puede crear una v\u00eda hacia la ciudadan\u00eda, un hecho que tambi\u00e9n ha frustrado los deseos de los predecesores de Trump de llevar a cabo importantes reformas en materia de inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\nTanto los presidentes Barack Obama como Joe Biden recurrieron a acciones ejecutivas para proteger a determinadas personas de la deportaci\u00f3n, iniciativas frecuentemente criticadas por Trump y otros republicanos. Pero el programa de Obama de Acci\u00f3n Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia, conocido como DACA, y el programa de Biden de parole humanitario para inmigrantes de Cuba, Hait\u00ed, Nicaragua y Venezuela, conocido como CHNV, no llegaron a conferir un estatus legal ni a proporcionar una v\u00eda hacia la ciudadan\u00eda.\n\nLos expertos en leyes de inmigraci\u00f3n dicen que un nuevo visado requerir\u00eda una nueva ley, algo que un presidente no puede crear por s\u00ed solo.\n\n\u201cEl Congreso tendr\u00eda que legislar un nuevo programa. Realmente no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 autoridad legal se tendr\u00eda para crear este nuevo programa de la nada\u201d, dice Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, director s\u00e9nior de relaciones gubernamentales de la Asociaci\u00f3n Estadounidense de Abogados de Inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\nEn otras palabras, los legisladores tendr\u00edan que aprobar una ley para crear el programa que Trump ha descrito.\n\nLa administraci\u00f3n Trump \u201cno tiene literalmente ning\u00fan poder legal para crear una categor\u00eda de visado\u201d, dice Charles Kuck, abogado de inmigraci\u00f3n en Atlanta.\n\nNo es la primera vez que Trump intenta vincular la riqueza a los privilegios de inmigraci\u00f3n. Durante su primer mandato, la administraci\u00f3n Trump intent\u00f3 remodelar la inmigraci\u00f3n legal a EE.UU. ampliando la definici\u00f3n de carga p\u00fablica y penalizando a quienes dependen de la asistencia p\u00fablica en las solicitudes de la green card.\n\nLos cr\u00edticos dijeron que esa medida, que finalmente fue revocada por la administraci\u00f3n Biden, equival\u00eda a una injusta \u201cprueba de riqueza\u201d, mientras que los funcionarios de la administraci\u00f3n Trump defendieron la medida, argumentando que la autosuficiencia es un valor estadounidense fundamental.\n\nEsta \u00faltima iniciativa de Trump se ha ganado los elogios de sus partidarios, que han alabado el pensamiento innovador del presidente, y las cr\u00edticas de los defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes, que dicen que est\u00e1 enviando un mensaje equivocado.\n\n\u201cLo \u00fanico que dice es que queremos a los m\u00e1s ricos en Estados Unidos, en vez de a los mejores y m\u00e1s brillantes, o a los que realmente van a servir al inter\u00e9s nacional de Estados Unidos\u2026 mejorando nuestra econom\u00eda en general\u201d, afirma Dalal-Dheini.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump sobre venta de \"tarjetas doradas\u201d: \u201cSe vender\u00e1n locamente\u201d 03:50 - Fuente: CNN Trump sobre venta de \"tarjetas doradas\u201d: \u201cSe vender\u00e1n locamente\u201d 03:50\n\nEl Congreso cre\u00f3 el programa EB-5. Eso significa que para acabar con \u00e9l ser\u00eda necesario que el Congreso actuara\n\nLutnick dijo el martes que la tarjeta dorada sustituir\u00eda al programa gubernamental de visados para inversores inmigrantes EB-5, que permite a los inversores extranjeros inyectar dinero en proyectos estadounidenses que crean puestos de trabajo y luego solicitar visados para inmigrar a Estados Unidos.\n\nLos expertos en leyes de inmigraci\u00f3n afirman que poner fin al programa EB-5 o modificarlo significativamente tambi\u00e9n requerir\u00eda la actuaci\u00f3n del Congreso.\n\nEl mi\u00e9rcoles, Lutnick sugiri\u00f3 que el programa ser\u00eda modificado en lugar de sustituido.\n\n\u201cModificaremos el acuerdo EB-5\u201d, dijo Lutnick. \u201c(La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional) Kristi (Noem) y yo estamos trabajando en ello juntos. Por 5 millones de d\u00f3lares, obtendr\u00e1n una licencia del Departamento de Comercio. Entonces har\u00e1n una inversi\u00f3n adecuada\u201d.\n\nEl Congreso cre\u00f3 el visado EB-5 en 1990. Los estatutos definen cu\u00e1ntos visados pueden concederse cada a\u00f1o en el marco del programa y cu\u00e1nto dinero deben aportar los inversores para participar. La ley permite la admisi\u00f3n de unos 10.000 inversores y familiares cualificados al a\u00f1o, seg\u00fan el Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n del Congreso.\n\nLos solicitantes que hayan presentado su solicitud antes del 15 de marzo de 2022 deben haber invertido al menos un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, o 500.000 d\u00f3lares en zonas econ\u00f3micamente desfavorecidas conocidas como \u00e1reas de empleo espec\u00edficas, seg\u00fan el Servicio de Ciudadan\u00eda e Inmigraci\u00f3n de EE.UU. Los solicitantes posteriores a esa fecha deben invertir al menos 1.050.000 d\u00f3lares, u 800.000 d\u00f3lares en zonas econ\u00f3micamente desfavorecidas.\n\nKuck, que afirma haber ayudado a cientos de clientes a navegar por el proceso de la EB-5, dice que ve \u201ccero posibilidades\u201d de que el Congreso elimine el programa y lo sustituya por la propuesta de la tarjeta dorada.\n\n\u201cLa cantidad de dinero que el programa EB-5 ha aportado en el transcurso de los \u00faltimos 30 a\u00f1os empeque\u00f1ecer\u00eda el n\u00famero de personas que realmente podr\u00edan permitirse y querer utilizar un visado dorado de 5 millones de d\u00f3lares\u201d, dice. \u201cLa gente con esa cantidad de dinero no quiere necesariamente estar sujeta a la fiscalidad estadounidense\u201d.\n\n\u00bfPodr\u00edan los legisladores aprobar cambios al programa en el proceso de reconciliaci\u00f3n presupuestaria?\n\nNicolette Glazer, abogada de inmigraci\u00f3n en California, dice que no ser\u00eda posible poner fin o cambiar significativamente el programa EB-5 de esa manera. Pero es posible que se a\u00f1ada una disposici\u00f3n de \u201ctarjeta dorada\u201d, dice, si se presenta como una simple tarifa de inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cPodr\u00eda verles intentando introducir algo as\u00ed solo para demostrar que est\u00e1n haciendo algo\u201d, afirma.\n\nEn el pasado, los dem\u00f3cratas intentaron cambiar la pol\u00edtica de inmigraci\u00f3n durante el proceso de conciliaci\u00f3n, pero el parlamentario del Senado lo rechaz\u00f3, explica Kuck.\n\n\u201cNo pueden cambiar la ley de inmigraci\u00f3n en la conciliaci\u00f3n\u201d, afirma.\n\nLos funcionarios no han dicho qu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda con los inversores que ya esperan una green card\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con los miles de personas que ya han solicitado visados EB-5 y est\u00e1n esperando decisiones del Gobierno?\n\nLas autoridades no han dicho lo que les suceder\u00eda bajo el plan de la tarjeta dorada.\n\nSeg\u00fan Dalal-Dheini, de la Asociaci\u00f3n Estadounidense de Abogados de Inmigraci\u00f3n, muchas de estas personas se han puesto en contacto con abogados ante la incertidumbre de lo que la nueva medida podr\u00eda significar para sus solicitudes.\n\n\u201cYa han invertido su dinero en esto mientras esperan que se apruebe su green card\u2026 Es un proceso de varios pasos y pueden pasar a\u00f1os, si no d\u00e9cadas, hasta que se apruebe\u201d, dice Dalal-Dheini. \u201cAs\u00ed que quitar el apoyo a esos inversores sin previo aviso o sin ninguna oportunidad de salvar su inversi\u00f3n o de poder finalizar su proceso ser\u00eda realmente injusto y perjudicar\u00eda realmente a nuestra econom\u00eda\u201d.\n\nTambi\u00e9n quedan sin respuesta otras preguntas sobre la propuesta de la tarjeta dorada, como si ayudar\u00eda o no a los licenciados extranjeros de las universidades estadounidenses. Eso es algo que Trump sugiri\u00f3 la semana pasada, aunque ofreciendo pocos detalles, diciendo que las empresas podr\u00edan comprar tarjetas doradas y d\u00e1rselas a los extranjeros como herramienta de contrataci\u00f3n.\n\nTampoco est\u00e1 claro c\u00f3mo se investigar\u00e1 a los solicitantes, aunque Lutnick insisti\u00f3 en que ser\u00eda una prioridad. Los cr\u00edticos ya advierten que la tarjeta dorada podr\u00eda atraer a delincuentes deseosos conseguir un acceso a Estados Unidos pagando.\n\n\u201cVender la ciudadan\u00eda estadounidense al mejor postor atraer\u00e1 a actores corruptos que buscan un refugio seguro para ellos y su dinero sucio\u201d, dijo la directora ejecutiva de Transparencia Internacional, Ma\u00edra Martini.\n\nPor su parte, Trump mantuvo que la creaci\u00f3n de las tarjetas doradas ser\u00eda \u201ctotalmente legal\u201d. A la pregunta de si considerar\u00eda vender las tarjetas a oligarcas rusos, Trump respondi\u00f3: \u201cS\u00ed, posiblemente. Conozco a algunos oligarcas rusos que son muy buena gente\u201d.\n\nA pesar de la confusi\u00f3n que caus\u00f3 el anuncio de Trump, Dalal-Dheini dice que ve una oportunidad en los recientes comentarios del presidente.\n\n\u201cNecesitamos aumentar el n\u00famero de tarjetas de residencia que tenemos a disposici\u00f3n de la gente. No hay suficientes\u201d, dice. \u201cY creo que lo que el presidente est\u00e1 subrayando es que los inmigrantes contribuyen realmente a nuestra econom\u00eda\u2026 Varios de nuestros grandes empresarios que han tenido mucho \u00e9xito vinieron aqu\u00ed como inmigrantes\u201d.\n\nY eso, dice, es algo en lo que mucha gente de todos los sectores puede estar de acuerdo, se haga realidad o no la propuesta de la tarjeta dorada de Trump.\n\nMichael Williams y Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contribuyeron a este reporte.",

Los aranceles para Canad\u00e1 y M\u00e9xico se retrasaron un mes, pero Trump implement\u00f3 un nuevo arancel del 10% general sobre los productos chinos.\n\nLutnick tambi\u00e9n indic\u00f3 que un arancel adicional del 10% sobre las importaciones chinas sigue sobre la mesa para este martes.\n\nLos economistas esperan que los aranceles impuestos a los tres principales socios comerciales de Estados Unidos encarezcan los bienes, incluidos zapatos, electr\u00f3nicos, comestibles y veh\u00edculos. Los aranceles podr\u00edan perjudicar a los consumidores y empresas estadounidenses que, a pesar de la disminuci\u00f3n de las tasas de inflaci\u00f3n, a\u00fan sienten los efectos de la inflaci\u00f3n a largo plazo.\n\nTambi\u00e9n este domingo, el secretario del Tesoro, Scott Bessent, dijo a Margaret Brennan de CBS News que M\u00e9xico ha ofrecido igualar a Estados Unidos con aranceles sobre China, y si Canad\u00e1 hace lo mismo, \u201ceso ser\u00eda un muy buen comienzo\u201d.\n\nM\u00e9xico y Canad\u00e1 podr\u00edan imponer tales aranceles \u201cpara el martes, o tal vez el muro de aranceles se levante, y luego veremos qu\u00e9 sucede a partir de ah\u00ed\u201d, dijo Bessent en \u201cFace the Nation\u201d.\n\nBessent dijo que el Departamento del Tesoro nombrar\u00eda un \u201czar de la asequibilidad\u201d para abordar las continuas presiones inflacionarias. El zar, dijo, \u201celegir\u00eda las cinco u ocho \u00e1reas donde esta administraci\u00f3n puede marcar la diferencia para los estadounidenses de clase trabajadora\u201d. Tambi\u00e9n plante\u00f3 la idea de un \u201cconsejo de asequibilidad\u201d.\n\nBessent ha dicho que los estadounidenses no deber\u00edan preocuparse por enfrentar precios m\u00e1s altos porque los aranceles no afectaron el precio de los bienes durante el primer Gobierno de Trump. Sin embargo, un an\u00e1lisis de datos del gobierno en enero de 2020 por la coalici\u00f3n de libre comercio Tariffs Hurt the Heartland mostr\u00f3 que las empresas estadounidenses pagaron US$ 46.000 millones m\u00e1s en aranceles de lo que habr\u00edan pagado sin los aranceles de Trump.\n\n\u201cEs un enfoque hol\u00edstico. Habr\u00e1 aranceles, habr\u00e1 recortes en la regulaci\u00f3n, habr\u00e1 energ\u00eda m\u00e1s barata\u201d, dijo Bessent. \u201cEspero que la inflaci\u00f3n contin\u00fae disminuyendo durante el a\u00f1o\u201d.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nTop US officials are piling heat on Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting he may need to relinquish power after his disastrous Oval Office meeting \u2014 even as Europe embraces the Ukrainian president more tightly than ever.\n\nThe contrast highlighted the most damaging split in the Western alliance at least since the Berlin Wall fell and bolstered a sense that the \u201cfree world\u201d has been pushed to the brink of fracturing early in President Donald Trump\u2019s new term.\n\nYet the sight of Europe stepping into the impasse left by Trump\u2019s first bid to end the Ukraine war could also represent hope that good could come out of the debacle of Zelensky\u2019s visit. That\u2019s if the continent can, as it promised Sunday, construct a peace plan to hand to the US president.\n\nStill, the fallout from Zelensky\u2019s calamitous trip to Washington is growing.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that the administration now questions whether Zelensky really wants to end the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cIf it becomes apparent that President Zelensky\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands.\u201d\n\nWaltz\u2019s comment underscores the US\u2019 position that the war must end no matter what as Trump races toward a rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin after falsely blaming Zelensky for the unprovoked invasion.\n\nBut British Prime Minister Keir Starmer led a gathering of Western leaders in London on Sunday that welcomed Zelensky as a guest of honor. In a highly symbolic move, King Charles III granted Zelensky an hourlong audience, days after inviting Trump to a second state visit. Starmer promised a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to arm and defend Ukraine and warned again that any durable peace would need US security guarantees Trump has not yet offered.\n\nAnd France and Britain also proposed a monthlong limited truce in Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron told the newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday. Zelensky said he was aware of the proposal but did not say whether he agreed with it.\n\nThe aggressive European leadership effort came as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Ukraine\u2019s allies needed to turn the country into a \u201csteel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.\u201d\n\nHow the Oval Office showdown changed the dynamics of the peace effort, and the West\n\nThe extraordinary scene Friday, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky \u2014 and then kicked him out of the White House \u2014 is already an indelible moment in the history of modern US foreign policy.\n\nThe bullying of the leader of a democratic nation under a Russian tyrant\u2019s illegal onslaught that has killed thousands of civilians sent shock waves through Washington and around the world. Trump\u2019s critics accuse him of siding with the invader in a repudiation of every US foreign policy value since World War II.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s supporters and key subordinates, however, the dressing down of Zelensky was a triumph. They argue it projected strength and epitomized the \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy that has transformed the nation\u2019s global role.\n\nHeated commentary and proclamations that the West is over in recent days may have been cathartic for all involved. But they hardly serve the cause of peace or the interests of the key players \u2014 apart from Putin, who must be enjoying the splintering of the West \u2014 long his principal foreign policy aim.\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s Cabinet members took to the Sunday cable news shows praising their boss. Yet Friday\u2019s fury undermined the claim that Trump is a masterful dealmaker and the only man alive who can end the war. It\u2019s clear Trump\u2019s only plan was to impose a peace deal on Ukraine after offering multiple concessions to Putin. And the showdown derailed a proposed deal for the US to exploit Ukraine\u2019s rare-earth minerals that Trump saw as a huge personal win. His insistence that he is a global peacemaker and his quest to win the Nobel Peace Prize now look more unrealistic than ever.\n\n\u2014 Zelensky\u2019s loss of his cool contributed to the diplomatic cataclysm, even if he was trying to explain to Vance and Trump why Ukraine is skeptical of a peace that does not include guarantees after Putin\u2019s repeated trashing of agreements. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Zelensky can ever sit at a peace table with Trump, and the US president could now decide to cut pending aid, intelligence and other support for Ukraine that could impede its forces on the battlefield.\n\n\u2014 The drama in the Oval Office prompted America\u2019s European allies into emergency action. They now intend to shield Zelensky from Trump and hope to draw up a viable peace framework that they could give to him as a basis for talks with Putin. But if the US walks away from Ukraine, Europe\u2019s capacity to fill the gap is questionable, largely because of its years of slashing military spending, its eroded military production base and its own reliance on US security guarantees to NATO members.\n\nUS officials suggest it\u2019s time for Zelensky to go\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson reinforced Waltz\u2019s warnings about the Ukrainian leader. \u201cEither he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nAfter the Oval Office breakdown Friday, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2014 who has been a supporter of Zelensky \u2014 chose to prioritize his loyalties to Trump, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again.\u201d\n\nOn \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Bash asked Waltz why he had once compared Zelensky to British wartime leader Winston Churchill but referred to him on Sirius XM on Saturday as an \u201cex-girlfriend that wants to argue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to do a history lesson \u2014 Churchill \u2026 stood and fought for his people,\u201d Waltz said. \u201cBut Churchill was also voted out of office in 1945. He was a man for a moment, but he did not then transition England into the next phase. And it\u2019s unclear whether President Zelensky, particularly after what we saw Friday, is ready to transition to Ukraine to an end to this war and to negotiate and have to compromise.\u201d\n\nWaltz\u2019s analogy misses important context. Like Ukraine, Britain didn\u2019t hold elections during wartime because of the national emergency. The 1945 election followed the Labour Party\u2019s exit from the national unity coalition \u2014 but only after victory in the European war was achieved and peace was secure. British troops were however still fighting in the Pacific war.\n\nUkraine was due to hold an election last year, but it was delayed while the country is under a Russian barrage with troops on the front lines and millions of refugees abroad. This reality undercuts the calls for the Ukrainian leader to go and Trump\u2019s claims that Zelensky is a \u201cdictator\u201d \u2014 another Russian propaganda favorite. In December, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who leads the largest Ukrainian opposition party, told a Council on Foreign Relations forum that elections should take place only \u201c60 days after our victory.\u201d\n\nA growing rift in the Western alliance\n\nZelensky\u2019s vilification in Washington and his embrace in London laid bare an estrangement between the US and its European allies, precipitated not just by Ukraine but by the Trump administration\u2019s warning that the continent must now take primary responsibility for its conventional defense.\n\nThe best-case scenario for the latest European initiative is that it proves to the US that Britain and its European Union friends are serious about fulfilling Trump\u2019s calls to police an eventual peace deal and that simultaneous promises to hike defense budgets preserve the NATO alliance despite the president\u2019s skepticism.\n\nEurope may be betting that Trump needs its help to forge a peace deal that he\u2019d rightly claim as a huge victory. And while the president\u2019s attempts to forge peace have so far been erratic and have favored Putin\u2019s positions, his friendship with the Kremlin strongman means he may be the only Western leader who can coax him to the table.\n\nEuropeans got some encouragement of a more evenhanded US role on Sunday when Waltz said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that an agreement was \u201cgoing to take Russian concessions on security guarantees.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is yet to agree to Starmer\u2019s and Macron\u2019s calls for a US backstop to any British- and French-led peace force. The British prime minister tried to dismiss suggestions of tension with the Trump team, saying Sunday, \u201cI do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally.\u201d\n\nStill, two top members of Trump\u2019s orbit sought to sabotage the European initiative.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, argued European countries that supported Zelensky after he was ejected from the White House are \u201cnot committed to the cause and values of freedom\u201d and don\u2019t believe in peace. Her remarks on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d will cause alarm in Europe, since they recall Moscow\u2019s talking points and because of her role as the top US spy.\n\nAnd Elon Musk, who is an ally of far-right extremists in Europe and slams the region\u2019s leaders \u2014 including Starmer \u2014 mocked the London summit. \u201cThe EU leaders and Zelensky having fancy dinners while men die in trenches,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cHow many parents will never see their son again? How many children will never see their father?\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US has suspended operations and planning for offensive cyber operations against Russia, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe suspension is \u201ca major blow,\u201d the official said, especially since planning for such operations takes time and research to carry out. The concern, the official said, is that the pause on offensive cyber operations against Russia will make the US more vulnerable to potential cyberattacks from Moscow, which has a formidable cadre of hackers capable of disrupting US critical infrastructure and collecting sensitive intelligence.\n\nThe pause in operations and planning from US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, comes as the Trump administration has sought a broader d\u00e9tente with Russia three years into Moscow\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday, throwing the US-Ukraine relationship into uncertainty.\n\n\u201cDue to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain,\u201d a senior defense official told CNN, referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe Record first reported on Cyber Command\u2019s suspension of planning related to Russia.\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for the Pentagon to pause actions which are potentially destabilizing or provocative for negotiations, including cyber-effects operations,\u201d Jason Kikta, a former Cyber Command official, told CNN. \u201cBut if a planning pause was also directed, that could cause offensive options to become stale and therefore nonviable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny extended period without checking on access and updating planning, risks losing that access or missing a critical change,\u201d Kikta said, adding that he was not personally aware of any change in status of Cyber Command operations.\n\nRussia and the US are in a regular state of confrontation in cyberspace, current and former US official say. The Kremlin sees cyberspace as a source of asymmetric advantage with the US, as it can burrow into US critical infrastructure and try to influence US elections.\n\nFor their part, American military and intelligence hackers have in recent years increasingly gone after Russian cybercriminals and intelligence operatives.\n\nSince 2016, when Russia used bots, trolls and hackers to try to influence the election in favor of Trump, Moscow has repeated that playbook in some form in every US presidential election, according to US officials.\n\nCyber Command was established more than a decade ago, in part to respond to threats from Russia and other foreign powers. The command has matured considerably since its inception, growing into a several-thousand strong force of computer operatives who conduct offensive and defensive missions.\n\nFrom its base at Fort Meade, Maryland, alongside the National Security Agency, Cyber Command has also increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command has sent specialists to allies around the world to try to help them defend against threats from cybercriminals and spies.\n\nThat includes a trip to Ukraine in December 2021, in anticipation of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, to help Kyiv prepare for an onslaught of Russian cyberattacks.\n\nMonths after Russia\u2019s full-scale of invasion, Cyber Command confirmed that it was actively engaged in helping Ukraine defend itself through cyberattacks.\n\nDespite the change in planning at Cyber Command, another major federal cybersecurity agency said it was not altering its posture.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the lead civilian agency for defending federal networks from hacks, said Sunday night on X that its mission is to \u201cdefend against all cyber threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, including from Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been no change in our posture,\u201d the agency said, in an apparent response to media reports that the agency was emphasizing non-Russia threats. \u201cAny reporting to the contrary is fake and undermines our national security.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump is expected to speak publicly Monday, for the first time since her husband returned to office, highlighting her support for a bill aimed at protecting Americans from deepfake and revenge pornography.\n\nTrump will hold a roundtable discussion Monday on Capitol Hill, according to the office of the first lady, to shine a light on the \u201cTAKE IT DOWN\u201d Act, which boosts protections for victims of non-consensual sharing of sexual images, including content generated by artificial intelligence, also known as deepfake porn.\n\nIn the past year, targets of AI-generated, non-consensual pornographic images have ranged from prominent women such as Taylor Swift and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to high school girls.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, \u201cwould criminalize the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \u2018deepfake pornography\u2019), and require social media and similar websites to have in place procedures to remove such content upon notification from a victim,\u201d according to Cruz\u2019s office.\n\nIt passed the Senate with bipartisan support during the last session of Congress and again in February but has yet to pass the House. Cruz and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, have supported the effort, and the first lady is now lending her support.\n\nDuring President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, Melania Trump unveiled her \u201cBe Best\u201d platform, which included a focus on online safety. She indicated in an interview shortly before the November election that she was interested in reinvigorating those efforts, and suggested she could take on \u201cnew issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren are suffering. We need to help them and educate them,\u201d she told Fox News in October.\n\nThe first lady has so far spent limited time in Washington during her husband\u2019s second term. After attending the inauguration and joining her husband on a trip to North Carolina and California, states that have recently been impacted with natural disasters, Melania Trump was absent from the White House between January 24 and February 22, when she reemerged to host a dinner with the nation\u2019s governors.\n\nThe first lady was expected to spend a majority of her time between New York, where son Barron is attending college, and Florida, CNN reported during the presidential transition. Sources familiar with her thinking said at the time that she would still be present for major events and would have her own platform and priorities as first lady.\n\nEven as she\u2019s been open about traversing the East Coast, the first lady has previously emphasized that she\u2019d be in DC. Asked where she planned to spend her time in a January 13 interview with Fox News\u2019 Ainsley Earhardt, Trump said, \u201cI will be in the White House. And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut my first priority is, you know, to be a mom, to be a first lady, to be a wife, and once we are in on January 20, you serve the country.\u201d\n\nThe president has also spent significant time in Florida since Inauguration Day, traveling to Miami or Palm Beach for his first four weekends in office.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCampaigning in Pennsylvania last September, JD Vance seemed to strike at an unlikely political foe: the besieged president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, who\u2019d spent most of the previous two years being hailed by Western leaders as a hero.\n\n\u201cYou know what I wish Zelensky would do when he comes to the United States of America?\u201d Vance asked his rally audience. \u201cSay thank you to the people of Pennsylvania and everybody else.\u201d\n\nThe crowd in Pennsylvania responded with hearty cheers. The future vice president had struck a nerve.\n\nFive months later, the moment seems prescient. A perceived lack of gratitude on the part of Zelensky is precisely what Vance seized on Friday, this time in the Oval Office, setting off an explosive rupture in ties between Washington and Kyiv and charting an unknown course for the future of the conflict.\n\nIn reality, Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the United States and its leaders for supporting Ukraine.\n\nYet for Vance, sitting on the gold brocade couch across from Zelensky, the moment thrust him to the forefront of an administration in which he had so far been relegated to supporting player. CNN previously reported that Vance has stepped forward in a more prominent way in recent weeks, asserting his role within the administration as Trump\u2019s \u201cSwiss army knife.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s Oval Office meeting amounted to a sudden real-life manifestation of Vance\u2019s combative online persona, one that was quickly embraced by President Donald Trump\u2019s team.\n\nAt the same time, Vance\u2019s interjection into the meeting nearly 40 minutes after it began generated questions about just how impromptu his rebuke really was.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of an ambush, that JD Vance knew what he was doing,\u201d Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who met earlier Friday with Zelensky, said after the explosive Oval Office meeting. \u201cHe probably anticipated Trump would rise to the bait, so to speak, and that Zelensky was basically laying out the betrayal and the dishonesty of Putin,\u201d the Connecticut senator said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhite House officials insist there was no ambush planned on Zelensky inside the Oval Office, pointing to the signing of an agreement on rare-earth minerals \u2014 complete with a long wooden table for the signatories \u2014 aides had planned for later in the day.\n\nInstead, they say Trump and Vance both felt disrespected by their Ukrainian guest, who pressed for American security guarantees even as the visit was meant to be centered on the rare-earths pact.\n\nAn administration source told CNN that \u201cnobody expected the meeting to play out as it did\u201d and expressed surprise at Zelensky\u2019s approach.\n\nVance\u2019s role in the argument followed him Saturday to Vermont, where protesters \u2014 some waving Ukrainian flags \u2014 lined the sidewalk awaiting his motorcade\u2019s arrival at Sugarbush Resort for a family trip. One person waved a \u201cGO SKI IN RUSSIA TRAITOR\u201d sign, while another poster read, \u201cSHAME ON YOU VANCE.\u201d\n\nTrump and his aides, however, enthusiastically heralded the vice president\u2019s combatting performance.\n\nFriday night, the White House Instagram account posted a photo prominently featuring Vance firmly pointing his hand toward Zelensky.\n\n\u201cDo you think that is respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\u201d the post read, quoting Vance.\n\nHighlighted in red: \u201cHave you said thank you once?\u201d\n\nWhile Vance has been in the Oval Office for other foreign leaders\u2019 visits, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier last week, he remained largely an observer, sitting back on the yellow couch with his hands folded in his lap.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first Cabinet meeting, it was billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 who has generated far more attention than Vance as he slashes through the federal bureaucracy \u2014 whom Trump allowed to speak for about six minutes.\n\nVance, by contrast, spoke for just 36 seconds, when Trump punted a question to him about what concessions he\u2019d like to see from Putin.\n\n\u201cGreat, you gave me the hardest question, sir,\u201d Vance said during the Wednesday meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do the negotiation in public in front of the American media. He\u2019s going to do it in private with the president of Russia, with the president of Ukraine and with other leaders.\u201d\n\nTurning next to address the media, Vance used the rest of his brief moment to criticize the press and flatter his boss.\n\n\u201cEvery single time the president engages in diplomacy, you guys preemptively accuse him of conceding to Russia. He hasn\u2019t conceded anything to anyone. He\u2019s doing the job of a diplomat, and he of course is the \u2018diplomat in chief\u2019 as the president of the United States,\u201d he said, before the meeting moved on.\n\nBefore Friday, Vance\u2019s most prominent event since taking office occurred 4,000 miles from the White House.\n\nIn a speech that shocked the Munich Security Conference last month, Vance lambasted European politicians, claiming they are suppressing free speech, losing control of immigration and refusing to work with hard-right parties in government. Later, he met with the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has been courting the Trump administration. A Vance official said over the course of his trip overseas, the vice president met with the leaders of each major German political party.\n\nVance\u2019s speech in Germany, his defense of Trump\u2019s diplomatic efforts during the Cabinet meeting and his accusations of ingratitude on the campaign trail all merged into Friday\u2019s Oval Office debacle.\n\nAfter a tense back-and-forth with Zelensky, Vance ultimately struck on the same argument he made as a candidate.\n\n\u201cOffer some words of appreciation for the United States of America,\u201d Vance said, gesturing his hand toward Trump, \u201cand the president of the United States of America, who is trying to save your country.\u201d\n\nThe extraordinary moment displayed a new side of Trump and Vance\u2019s relationship, as the pair appeared to team up against Zelensky in real time.\n\n\u201cPlease, you think that if you speak very loudly about the war \u2014\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nJumping to Vance\u2019s defense, Trump said, \u201cHe\u2019s not speaking loudly.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment, though, that Trump took a different view from Vance, after the vice president scolded Zelensky for litigating disagreements in front of the press.\n\n\u201cJust say thank you \u2014\u201d Vance said.\n\n\u201cI said it a lot of times to the American people,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\n\u201cAccept that there are disagreements and let\u2019s go litigate those rather than trying to fight it out in front of the American media when you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Vance said.\n\nTrump piped up, \u201cBut you see, I think it\u2019s good for the American people to see what\u2019s going on. I think it\u2019s very important. That\u2019s why I kept this going so long.\u201d\n\nAfter wrapping the bilateral meeting, Trump said it would make \u201cgreat television.\u201d\n\nAs reporters were eventually escorted out of the room, Vance gave Trump two approving pats on his arm.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the names of five digital assets he expects to include in a new U.S. crypto strategic reserve on Sunday, spiking the market value of each.\n\nTrump said on social media that his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including bitcoin. The names had not previously been announced.\n\nThe assets rose 8% to 62% in trading on Sunday.\n\nTrump said his order \u201cdirected the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\u201d\n\nMore than an hour later, Trump added another post: \u201cAnd, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve.\u201d\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up around 8% at $90,828. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency, was up 8.3% at $2,409.\n\nThe Republican president won support from the crypto industry in his 2024 election bid, and he has quickly moved to back their policy priorities. Under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.\n\nIn recent weeks though, cryptocurrency prices are down sharply, with some of the biggest digital currencies erasing nearly all of the gains made after Trump\u2019s election win triggered a wave of excitement across the industry.\n\nAnalysts say the market needs a reason to move higher, such as indications that the U.S. Federal Reserve plans to cut interest rates or a clear pro-crypto regulatory framework from the Trump administration.\n\nTrump is hosting the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday. His family has also launched its own coins.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the new stockpile will be set up or work.\n\nAnalysts and legal experts are divided on whether an act of Congress will be necessary. Some have argued the reserve could be created via the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which can be used to purchase or sell foreign currencies.\n\nTrump\u2019s crypto group had planned to look at potentially creating the stockpile with cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday he expects the United States to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Tuesday, but that the situation is \u201cfluid\u201d and President Donald Trump will determine the levels.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be tariffs on Tuesday on Mexico and Canada,\u201d Lutnick told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cExactly what they are, we\u2019re going to leave that for the president and his team to negotiate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed tariffs from February consisted of a 25% duty on all imports from Mexico and most from Canada (energy products were to have a 10% tariff), along with a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for a month, but Trump did enact a new 10% across-the-board tariff on Chinese products.\n\nLutnick also indicated that an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports remains on the table for Tuesday.\n\nEconomists expect tariffs placed on America\u2019s top three trading partners will make goods, including shoes, electronics, groceries and vehicles more expensive. Tariffs could hurt American consumers and businesses who, despite easing inflation rates, still feel the effects of long-term inflation.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan that Mexico has offered to match the United States with tariffs on China, and if Canada does the same, \u201cthat would be a very good start.\u201d\n\nMexico and Canada could impose such tariffs \u201cby Tuesday, or maybe the tariff wall goes up, and then we see what happens from there,\u201d Bessent said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nBessent said the Treasury Department would appoint an \u201caffordability czar\u201d to address continued inflationary pressures. The czar, he said, would \u201cpick the five or eight areas where this administration can make a difference for working-class Americans.\u201d He also floated the idea of an \u201caffordability council.\u201d\n\nBessent has said Americans should not be worried about facing increased prices because tariffs did not affect the price of goods during Trump\u2019s first administration. But an analysis of government data in January 2020 by the free-trade coalition Tariffs Hurt the Heartland showed US companies paid $46 billion more in tariffs than they would have without Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a holistic approach. There will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy,\u201d said Bessent. \u201cI\u2019m expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.\u201d",

Cuando la noticia llega a o\u00eddos de sus padres, se desencadena una trepidante aventura que abarca Nueva York y Las Vegas.\n\nEl director Sean Baker y los productores de la pel\u00edcula hicieron hincapi\u00e9 en que \u201cAnora\u201d es una pel\u00edcula independiente y animaron a otros a seguir la v\u00eda independiente.\n\n\u201cHicimos esta pel\u00edcula de forma independiente.

A todos los so\u00f1adores y j\u00f3venes cineastas: cuenten las historias que quieran contar. Cuenten las historias que los muevan. Les prometo que nunca se arrepentir\u00e1n\u201d, dijo la productora Samantha Quan.\n\nBaker se alz\u00f3 con el Oscar a mejor director por su trabajo en la pel\u00edcula, mientras que Madinson se qued\u00f3 con la estatuilla a mejor actriz.\n\nEn su discurso de agradecimiento tras recibir el premio a mejor director, Baker hizo un apasionado llamamiento para salvar las salas de cine de Estados Unidos. Pidi\u00f3 que los cineastas siguieran haciendo pel\u00edculas para la gran pantalla, que los distribuidores se centraran en los estrenos en salas y que la gente siguiera viendo pel\u00edculas en los cines.\n\nPor su parte, al ganar el premio a mejor actriz Madison dijo que era \u201cmuy surrealista\u201d, y luego dio las gracias a la Academia, a la compa\u00f1\u00eda cinematogr\u00e1fica Neon, a su familia, a sus compa\u00f1eros de reparto y a los dem\u00e1s nominados.\n\nMadison hizo un reconocimiento a la comunidad de trabajadores sexuales.\n\n\u201cSeguir\u00e9 apoyando y siendo una aliada\u201d, dijo. \u201cToda la gente incre\u00edble, las mujeres que he tenido el privilegio de conocer de esa comunidad ha sido uno de los puntos destacados de toda esta incre\u00edble experiencia\u201d.\n\nEn v\u00edsperas de los Oscar de este fin de semana, \u201cAnora\u201d obtuvo victorias decisivas en los premios PGA, DGA y WGA, as\u00ed como el Critics Choice Award a la mejor pel\u00edcula y la Palma de Oro en el Festival de Cannes del a\u00f1o pasado.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPara los observadores diplom\u00e1ticos experimentados, la furiosa reprimenda del presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, a su par ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky en la Oficina Oval fue un golpe pol\u00edtico planificado, una trampa preparada por el Gobierno de Trump para desacreditar al l\u00edder ucraniano y eliminarlo como un obst\u00e1culo para lo que venga despu\u00e9s.\n\nSea orquestada o no, Mosc\u00fa \u2013que reaccion\u00f3 con regocijo al intercambio de insultos en la Casa Blanca\u2013 ahora espera que las conversaciones destinadas a reconstruir la relaci\u00f3n entre Estados Unidos y Rusia contin\u00faen, incluso se aceleren, en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas.\n\nNo se ha anunciado nada en p\u00fablico, pero, en privado, se habla de que la cumbre Trump-Putin, siempre en agenda, ahora se est\u00e1 acelerando.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay un renovado optimismo en Mosc\u00fa de que, con el presidente Zelensky en desacuerdo con el presidente Trump y su equipo, las dif\u00edciles negociaciones para poner fin a la guerra en Ucrania ahora pasar\u00e1n a un segundo plano ante una serie de acuerdos econ\u00f3micos potencialmente lucrativos entre Estados Unidos y Rusia que ya se est\u00e1n discutiendo a puertas cerradas.\n\nRiad, en Arabia Saudita, es donde el secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Marco Rubio, y el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores ruso, Sergeii Lavrov, encabezaron la primera ronda de conversaciones extraordinarias el mes pasado, dejando de lado a Ucrania.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Rusos muestran apoyo a Trump tras reuni\u00f3n con Zelensky en la Casa Blanca 00:49 - Fuente: CNN Rusos muestran apoyo a Trump tras reuni\u00f3n con Zelensky en la Casa Blanca 00:49\n\nCNN ha sabido que ya est\u00e1n en marcha los preparativos para una segunda ronda, que se celebrar\u00e1 en breve, posiblemente tambi\u00e9n en un estado del Golfo.\n\nEl enviado econ\u00f3mico clave del Kremlin para las conversaciones, Kirill Dmitriev, ya ha dicho a CNN que la cooperaci\u00f3n con Estados Unidos podr\u00eda \u201cincluir acuerdos energ\u00e9ticos\u201d de alg\u00fan tipo, pero no se han anunciado detalles.\n\nPor otra parte, el Financial Times informa que ha habido esfuerzos para involucrar a los inversores estadounidenses en la reanudaci\u00f3n del gasoducto ruso Nord Stream 2 a Europa, que Alemania detuvo al comienzo de la invasi\u00f3n rusa de Ucrania.\n\nDmitriev ha pedido a la administraci\u00f3n Trump y a Rusia que empiecen a \u201cconstruir un futuro mejor para la humanidad\u201d y que \u201cse centren en la inversi\u00f3n, el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico, los avances en inteligencia artificial\u201d y en proyectos cient\u00edficos conjuntos a largo plazo como la \u201cexploraci\u00f3n de Marte\u201d, e incluso ha publicado una infograf\u00eda de gran calidad en la plataforma de redes sociales X de Elon Musk, que muestra una misi\u00f3n conjunta imaginaria de Estados Unidos, Rusia y Arabia Saudita a Marte, a bordo de lo que parece ser un cohete Space X.\n\nDejando de lado los numerosos riesgos, es evidente que se pueden obtener enormes beneficios haciendo negocios con Rusia, que, por cierto, tambi\u00e9n tiene la cuarta reserva de tierras raras m\u00e1s grande del mundo, mucho mayor que la de Ucrania.\n\nEso atrae claramente al mercantil presidente Trump, cuya incansable b\u00fasqueda de un acuerdo lucrativo est\u00e1 siendo aprovechada por el estado ruso.\n\n\u201cLa perspicacia empresarial de Trump aplasta las narrativas de Biden. El intento de derrotar a Rusia fracas\u00f3\u201d, coment\u00f3 Dmitriev en X.\n\nPero lo que se ha presenciado desde la investidura de Trump en enero parece ser mucho m\u00e1s que dinero, sino un restablecimiento fundamental de los lazos entre Estados Unidos y Rusia.\n\nAl abrazar tan estrechamente al Kremlin, el Gobierno de Trump corre el riesgo de dar la espalda a los aliados occidentales, dejando a Europa aislada en un cambio radical de la postura global de Washington.\n\nIncluso el Kremlin, algo sorprendido por la velocidad de los acontecimientos, ha tomado nota p\u00fablicamente.\n\n\u201cEl nuevo Gobierno (estadounidense) est\u00e1 cambiando r\u00e1pidamente todas las configuraciones de pol\u00edtica exterior. Esto coincide en gran medida con nuestra visi\u00f3n\u201d, dijo el portavoz del Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, a la televisi\u00f3n estatal rusa en comentarios que se emitieron este domingo.\n\nPero por qu\u00e9 el presidente estadounidense elegir\u00eda al Kremlin en lugar de los socios tradicionales de Estados Unidos sigue siendo objeto de intensa especulaci\u00f3n.\n\nGran parte de ella, como la sugerencia frecuente de que Trump es de alguna manera un agente del Kremlin, o est\u00e1 en deuda con Putin, no tiene pruebas.\n\nTal vez la fantas\u00eda ideol\u00f3gica de la derecha estadounidense de que Rusia es un aliado natural de Estados Unidos en una futura confrontaci\u00f3n con China, y que puede separarse de su principal apoyo, est\u00e9 motivando el dram\u00e1tico giro geopol\u00edtico de Washington.\n\nPero para muchos observadores desconcertados, ambas explicaciones para el extraordinario giro de Trump hacia el Kremlin parecen igualmente fuera de lugar.\n\nLa relaci\u00f3n habitualmente tensa, cuando no abiertamente hostil, entre Estados Unidos y Rusia parece estar entrando en una fase nueva y radical.",

El presidente Donald Trump y el vicepresidente J. D. Vance hab\u00edan empezado a re\u00f1ir a su invitado, el presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, en una implosi\u00f3n p\u00fablica hasta ahora nunca vista de una relaci\u00f3n mundial clave.\n\nPara los partidarios de Ucrania, el momento fue desastroso: todo lo que pod\u00eda haber salido mal en una reuni\u00f3n entre dos l\u00edderes testarudos sali\u00f3 mal en 10 minutos.\n\nSin embargo, a pesar de la conmoci\u00f3n, no fue un resultado imprevisto. De hecho, en los proleg\u00f3menos de las conversaciones \u2013que deb\u00edan culminar con la firma de un nuevo acuerdo sobre minerales de tierras raras\u2013 muchos aliados de ambos hombres se preguntaban en voz baja si su din\u00e1mica, ya de por s\u00ed combustible, acabar\u00eda en triunfo o en cat\u00e1strofe.\n\nSe hicieron esfuerzos para preparar a Zelensky para una reuni\u00f3n fruct\u00edfera con Trump, famoso por ser susceptible a los halagos y muy sensible a c\u00f3mo se le trata. Se advirti\u00f3 al presidente ucraniano de que se centrara directamente en el acuerdo sobre los minerales y evitara verse envuelto en una pelea.\n\n\u201cEsta ma\u00f1ana le he dicho: \u2018No muerdas el anzuelo. No dejes que los medios ni nadie te meta en una discusi\u00f3n con el presidente Trump. Lo que est\u00e1 haciendo hoy es restablecer la relaci\u00f3n\u2019\u201d, dijo el senador Lindsey Graham, que estaba entre un grupo de senadores republicanos y dem\u00f3cratas que se reunieron con Zelensky antes de que llegara a la Casa Blanca.\n\nOtros l\u00edderes europeos que hab\u00edan pasado por el edificio esta semana ofrecieron a Zelensky su propia orientaci\u00f3n, incluido el presidente de Francia, Emmanuel Macron, que ha encontrado el \u00e9xito en un acercamiento a Trump que equilibra la adulaci\u00f3n con el rechazo.\n\nOtros, incluidos algunos funcionarios estadounidenses, trataron de disuadir a Zelensky de hacer el viaje a Washington, creyendo que a\u00fan era necesario trabajar para fortalecer lo que ya se hab\u00eda convertido en una relaci\u00f3n hostil.\n\nSin embargo, cuando Zelensky entr\u00f3 en la Casa Blanca este viernes, pocos pod\u00edan predecir lo explosivos que ser\u00edan los 139 minutos que siguieron, aunque algunos detectaron los primeros indicios de problemas.\n\nAl bajarse de su veh\u00edculo todoterreno negro, vestido con el que se ha convertido en su uniforme habitual (camisa y pantalones militares), Zelensky no aparentaba tensi\u00f3n alguna con Trump, que hab\u00eda recorrido los pasillos del ala oeste para saludarle.\n\nPero algunos funcionarios estadounidenses que observaban desde lejos vieron un problema: el atuendo de Zelensky.\n\n\u201cOh, vas muy elegante\u201d, dijo Trump con aire sarc\u00e1stico al saludar a Zelensky y estrecharle la mano.\n\nAntes de que la reuni\u00f3n en el Despacho Oval se convirtiera en una pelea a gritos, Zelensky fue preguntado por un periodista de un medio de comunicaci\u00f3n de derechas \u2013elegido por la Casa Blanca para estar en la sala durante las conversaciones\u2013 por qu\u00e9 no llevaba traje en el m\u00e1s alto despacho de Estados Unidos.\n\n\u201cMe pondr\u00e9 un traje cuando acabe esta guerra, s\u00ed\u201d, dijo Zelensky, respondiendo en ingl\u00e9s. \u201cQuiz\u00e1 algo como el tuyo, s\u00ed, quiz\u00e1 algo mejor. No lo s\u00e9, ya veremos. Quiz\u00e1 algo m\u00e1s barato. Gracias\u201d.\n\nQuiz\u00e1s aprendiendo la lecci\u00f3n del desfile de l\u00edderes extranjeros que le hab\u00edan precedido en la Casa Blanca durante el \u00faltimo mes, Zelensky no lleg\u00f3 con las manos vac\u00edas. Trajo consigo el cintur\u00f3n de la UFC que gan\u00f3 el boxeador ucraniano Oleksandr Usyk el a\u00f1o pasado.\n\nEl vistoso cintur\u00f3n dorado, que estaba apoyado en una de las mesas mientras los dos hombres empezaban a hablar, no se mencion\u00f3 durante las conversaciones, brillando bajo las luces.\n\nDurante los primeros 40 minutos de conversaci\u00f3n, Trump no mostr\u00f3 rencor hacia Zelensky, sino que habl\u00f3 del acuerdo sobre minerales que ten\u00edan previsto firmar ese mismo d\u00eda.\n\nDe hecho, arriba, en la sala este, se hab\u00eda preparado una larga mesa de madera para la ceremonia de la firma, con cuatro sillas preparadas para los signatarios.\n\nPero no fue as\u00ed.\n\nEl vicepresidente toma la palabra\n\nUni\u00e9ndose a la conversaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de permanecer casi siempre en silencio, Vance intervino \u2013\u201cun momento; quiero responder a esto\u201d\u2013, para defender los esfuerzos de Trump por poner fin al conflicto.\n\n\u201cEl camino hacia la paz y la prosperidad quiz\u00e1 sea la diplomacia\u201d, dijo, dirigiendo sus comentarios a Zelensky.\n\nAh\u00ed es donde todo se torci\u00f3.\n\nZelensky, poco acostumbrado a las reprimendas p\u00fablicas despu\u00e9s de tres a\u00f1os de apoyo incondicional de Occidente, expuso con indignaci\u00f3n los altos el fuego que Rusia hab\u00eda roto en el pasado.\n\n\u201c\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 tipo de diplomacia, J. D., est\u00e1s hablando? \u00bfQu\u00e9\u2026 qu\u00e9 tienes\u2026 qu\u00e9\u2026 qu\u00e9 quieres decir?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 incr\u00e9dulo.\n\n\u201cEstoy hablando del tipo de diplomacia que va a acabar con la destrucci\u00f3n de tu pa\u00eds\u201d, respondi\u00f3 Vance desde su lugar en el sof\u00e1 junto a Trump.\n\nA partir de ah\u00ed, la cosa fue a m\u00e1s.\n\n\u201cCreo que es una falta de respeto que vengas al Despacho Oval a intentar litigar sobre esto delante de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n estadounidenses\u201d, dijo Vance en una dura reprimenda. \u201cDeber\u00eda dar las gracias al presidente por intentar poner fin a este conflicto\u201d.\n\nCuando Zelensky intent\u00f3 \u2013algo sin \u00e9xito\u2013 intervenir, Trump estall\u00f3 en c\u00f3lera.\n\n\u201cNo tienes las cartas en este momento\u201d, bram\u00f3, pasando por encima de Zelensky cuando objet\u00f3.\n\n\u201cEst\u00e1n jugando con la vida de millones de personas\u201d, grit\u00f3. \u201cTe est\u00e1s jugando la Tercera Guerra Mundial\u201d.\n\nUnos minutos despu\u00e9s, Trump despidi\u00f3 a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n de la sala.\n\n\u201cEsto va a ser una gran televisi\u00f3n, lo aseguro\u201d, dijo mientras los periodistas sal\u00edan.\n\nUna nerviosa delegaci\u00f3n ucraniana \u2013incluida la embajadora de Ucrania en Washington, Oksana Markarova, que dej\u00f3 de tomar notas durante la reuni\u00f3n y se limit\u00f3 a apoyar la cabeza entre las manos\u2013 abandon\u00f3 el Despacho Oval para reagruparse en el Sal\u00f3n Roosevelt, al final del pasillo.\n\nAcurrucado con sus propios asesores clave para evaluar la situaci\u00f3n, entre ellos Vance, el secretario de Estado Marco Rubio y el secretario del Tesoro Scott Bessent, Trump se enfureci\u00f3, diciendo que se sent\u00eda faltado al respeto por el tono de Zelensky.\n\n\u201cZelensky lo interpret\u00f3 tan mal como pod\u00eda interpretarlo. Entr\u00f3 en el Despacho Oval actuando como un tipo duro. No estuvo bien. Todos en la sala se sintieron insultados\u201d, dijo un funcionario estadounidense. \u201cAhora Zelensky tendr\u00e1 que encontrar la manera de arreglar esto por s\u00ed mismo. No podemos arreglarlo por \u00e9l\u201d.\n\nAl final, el presidente decidi\u00f3 que Zelensky \u201cno estaba en condiciones de negociar\u201d, dijo un funcionario de la Casa Blanca. Orden\u00f3 a Rubio y al asesor de seguridad nacional Mike Waltz que transmitieran el mensaje a los ucranianos que esperaban cerca: era hora de que Zelensky se fuera.\n\nLos ucranianos protestaron, diciendo que quer\u00edan continuar las conversaciones, dijo el funcionario de la Casa Blanca. Pero la petici\u00f3n fue rechazada.\n\nMientras los platos de ensalada, pollo y cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e previstos para el almuerzo se quedaban sin comer en los carritos de un pasillo frente al despacho de la secretaria de Prensa, se orden\u00f3 a los ucranianos que se marcharan.\n\nEl surrealista d\u00eda de diplomacia rota se desarroll\u00f3 en menos de tres horas.\n\nLa comitiva de Zelensky abandon\u00f3 las puertas de la Casa Blanca a la 1:42 p.m. hora local, sin fanfarria ni despedida. Fue conducido a poca distancia del hotel Hay Adams, donde se alojaban \u00e9l y sus asesores.\n\nMenos de una hora despu\u00e9s, envi\u00f3 un mensaje en las redes sociales expresando su gratitud a sus anfitriones: \u201cGracias Estados Unidos, gracias por su apoyo, gracias por esta visita\u201d. Y a\u00f1adi\u00f3: \u201cUcrania necesita una paz justa y duradera y estamos trabajando exactamente para eso\u201d.\n\nLos aliados de Trump se unen en torno al presidente\n\nPara entonces, una Casa Blanca que hab\u00eda empezado el d\u00eda buscando llegar a un acuerdo con Ucrania hab\u00eda cambiado repentinamente de rumbo y buscaba convertir el revuelo diplom\u00e1tico en un momento de fortaleza lanzando una extraordinaria ofensiva de relaciones p\u00fablicas.\n\n\u201cEl presidente Trump y el vicepresidente Vance est\u00e1n defendiendo a los estadounidenses\u201d, dijo la Casa Blanca en el primero de varios comunicados este viernes por la tarde. Pocas horas despu\u00e9s, lleg\u00f3 otro mensaje con palabras de apoyo de miembros del gabinete Trump.\n\n\u201cAm\u00e9n, se\u00f1or presidente\u201d, dijo el secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth.\n\nGraham, un estrecho aliado de Trump que se hab\u00eda reunido con Zelensky a primera hora del d\u00eda, se dirigi\u00f3 a las c\u00e1maras fuera del ala oeste. Pidi\u00f3 a Zelensky que se disculpara o considerara la posibilidad de dimitir.\n\n\u201cNunca he estado m\u00e1s orgulloso del presidente\u201d, dijo Graham.\n\nMientras, en el interior de la sala este de la Casa Blanca se desmontaba el montaje para una rueda de prensa de Trump y Zelensky. Una gran mesa para que los dos l\u00edderes firmaran el acuerdo, con un tel\u00f3n de fondo de tres banderas ucranianas y tres estadounidenses, fue apartada.\n\nDurante las horas siguientes, Trump trabaj\u00f3 en el ala oeste con su personal. Se le vio en el Despacho Oval con Susie Wiles, la secretaria general de la Casa Blanca, y otros asesores antes de que saliera para abandonar la Casa Blanca durante el fin de semana.\n\nEl Marine One estaba esperando, pero Trump se detuvo para hablar una vez m\u00e1s, tratando de poner su sello en el notable giro de los acontecimientos del d\u00eda.\n\n\u201cEst\u00e1 buscando seguir adelante y luchar, luchar, luchar\u201d, dijo Trump a los periodistas en el jard\u00edn sur. \u201cEstamos buscando acabar con la muerte\u201d.\n\nPreguntado sobre si quer\u00eda que Zelensky dimitiera, Trump declin\u00f3 responder directamente, limit\u00e1ndose a decir: \u201cQuiero a alguien que haga las paces\u201d.\n\nUn d\u00eda de torbellino en Washington lleg\u00f3 a su fin cuando Trump abord\u00f3 el Air Force One y vol\u00f3 a su resort Mar-a-Lago para pasar el fin de semana. Poco despu\u00e9s del despegue, Zelensky apareci\u00f3 en Fox News, para una entrevista que Trump vio en el avi\u00f3n presidencial.\n\nZelensky dijo que no cre\u00eda deber una disculpa a Trump por los fogosos arrebatos en el Despacho Oval, pero lament\u00f3 que todo se desarrollara en televisi\u00f3n para que el mundo lo viera. \u201cCreo que no estuvo bien\u201d, dijo Zelenksy a Bret Baier, de Fox News. \u201cCreo que no fue bueno\u201d.\n\nPero dijo que cree que su relaci\u00f3n con Trump y Estados Unidos sobrevivir\u00e1.\n\n\u201cSu gente ayud\u00f3 a salvar a nuestra gente\u201d, dijo Zelensky. \u201cEstamos muy, muy agradecidos\u201d.",

Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cCorporations have more than sufficient profit margins to absorb small price increases to a small input to production,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2023, data showed the Coca-Cola Company packaged almost 50% of its drinks in plastic bottles, 25% in aluminum cans, and the remaining 25% in glass bottles and other packaging. Data from Keurig DrPepper showed they packaged 27% of their drinks in plastic bottles, 13% in aluminum cans and 8% in glass.\n\nQuincey also made clear that while tariffs on aluminum will likely result in an extra cost, they are unlikely to have a significant impact on beverage corporations the size of Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system. It\u2019s not insignificant, but it\u2019s not going to radically change a multibillion-dollar US business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cost. It will have to be managed. It would be better not to have it relative to the business, but we are going to manage our way through.\u201d\n\nA can costs a little bit less than 4 cents to produce, according to Hersh. \u201cIf we put a 25% tariff on that, it would raise the cost of the can to 5 cents,\u201d he said, adding that it would increase the production cost of a six-pack by 6 cents.\n\nInvestors largely agree aluminum tariffs won\u2019t result in significant cost hikes as share prices of beverage corporations have been relatively stable since they were announced, according to Hersh.\n\nBottlers drive packaging decisions\n\nMost beverage corporations outsource packaging to bottlers, and it is the bottlers who purchase raw aluminum and ultimately decide on pricing and strategy, says Filippo Falorni, a beverage analyst at Citi.\n\nCoca-Cola sells its concentrate to bottlers, who mix it with water and package it on production lines that are interchangeable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to change production lines from cans to bottles,\u201d Falorni said.\n\nCoca-Cola products at a grocery store in Miami Beach, Florida, in May 2022. Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nIncreasing the use of plastic packaging instead of aluminum is primarily a cost-mitigation strategy, given the ease of switching production lines \u2014 and not necessarily because of prohibitively high aluminum prices, he said.\n\nBut switching to other kinds of packaging might be more complicated for smaller beverage companies and ones that package in-house, as CNN previously reported.\n\nMoving away from aluminum cans can be \u201ca colossal decision,\u201d and it \u201cnormally takes a period of years to make a transition like that successfully,\u201d said William Pietersen, a professor at Columbia Business School and former CEO of Lever Foods, Seagram USA and Tropicana.\n\nSince Trump announced the new tariffs, aluminum prices have climbed over 4%, which Hersh called \u201crelatively stable.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users (CAMMU) said 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum could directly harm domestic manufacturers.\n\n\u201cRe-imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from our allies and without a workable exclusion process puts U.S. manufacturers directly in harm\u2019s way,\u201d according to a statement from CAMMU.\n\n\u201cForeign customers are shifting their supply chains away from U.S. producers. Once removed, especially for smaller, family-owned businesses, it is difficult to regain that lost business,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nIn 2024, the United States imported about 47% of the aluminum consumed domestically, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nDifferent strategies\n\nBut when combining the tariffs from Trump\u2019s first term, the price of aluminum traded on the market and the domestic production of aluminum have seen a real impact in recent years, Falorni said.\n\nWithin the beverage industry, companies adapt to price hikes in different ways.\n\nCompanies like Coca-Cola, with only 25% of their revenue coming from the United States, can offset rising costs by leveraging earnings from other markets.\n\nThis flexibility makes the company less vulnerable to aluminum tariffs than companies like Keurig Dr Pepper, which relies heavily on the US market and is more exposed to domestic price fluctuations, Falorni said.\n\nWhile about a quarter of Coca-Cola products come in aluminum cans, consumers are also accustomed to plastic and glass bottles.\n\nEnergy drinks like Monster and seltzers like White-Claw are predominantly sold in cans, with few viable alternatives. For these brands, shifting to other materials could hurt demand, leaving them with little choice but to pass higher costs on to consumers, according to Falorni.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nWhile switching to plastic and glass packaging would have a minor financial impact on soft-drink companies like Coca-Cola, it could be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the environment, according to Judith Enck, the president of Beyond Plastics and a former regional administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cAny significant shift toward more plastic bottles is a huge environmental problem,\u201d Enck told CNN.\n\nRefillable glass containers are the most sustainable packaging option for beverage companies, followed by aluminum cans (because they can be easily recycled) and then single-use glass bottles. Plastic is one of the least sustainable, as about 16,000 chemicals are used to produce plastics, according to Enck.\n\nCoca-Cola bottles are the world\u2019s No. 1 source of plastic pollution. In December, the company announced a drastic reduction of its packaging sustainability goals.\n\nBeverage corporations likely won\u2019t feel much blowback from the Trump administration should they choose less sustainable packaging.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is sending a very clear message that they do not prioritize environmental protection,\u201d Enck said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think big companies feel any pressure to change.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on immigration \u2014 legal and otherwise \u2014 setting the stage for potential labor shortages, weaker economic growth and higher inflation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced a flurry of immigration policies immediately after taking office in late January, many of them aimed at curbing illegal entries \u2014 a core tenet of his presidential campaign. But he\u2019s also chipped away at legal avenues, such as shutting down the asylum-seeking process at the US-Mexico border and canceling flights for refugees who had already been vetted.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we depend on immigrant labor in this country and Trump\u2019s policies could have enormous consequences for many industries,\u201d Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs at the American Immigration Council, told CNN.\n\nIn the past, Trump has said he\u2019d welcome legal immigrants, saying \u201cwe have to have the quality people coming in\u201d on his second day in office. Last week, he unveiled a \u201cgold card\u201d visa program for wealthy foreigners to live and work in the US.\n\nBut several experts tell CNN that legal immigration is expected to decline throughout Trump\u2019s second term as his administration fosters a hostile environment for immigrants through its policies and messaging, which could lead to fewer available workers across industries and higher inflation. There are already signs of legal immigration slowing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been surprisingly quiet,\u201d Melissa Lopez, an attorney and executive director of Estrella Del Paso immigration legal services firm, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 17 and a half years here in El Paso, and this feels low.\u201d\n\nAs Americans have fewer children, its population is starting to age. That means the health care industry is increasingly desperate for workers to care for the elderly. And industries that rely on younger people, including construction and agriculture, are in need of staff.\n\nEconomists say immigration is the solution America\u2019s economy needs. That\u2019s a dilemma \u2014 because the White House says immigration is the problem.\n\nFewer legal immigrants in the future?\n\nLegal immigration to the US dropped off in 2020 because of pandemic-era restrictions, but climbed sharply in the following years.\n\nLast year, about 2.8 million people immigrated to the United States legally, according to the Census Bureau. That includes refugees and those entering the country through worker visas, accounting for 84% of the country\u2019s population growth in 2024.\n\nA report from the right-leaning Cato Institute released last month argued that today\u2019s high level of immigration gives Trump \u201cmore room to implement restrictions\u201d as it tries to \u201cappease his nativist base and the nationalist political class by cutting legal immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect we\u2019ll see further restrictions by the summer,\u201d said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute. The Trump administration is considering invoking a public health order labeling migrants at the southern border seeking asylum as risks for spreading diseases \u2014 a power officials used during the pandemic to seal off the border.\n\nAllianz Trade forecasts legal immigration to be cut nearly by half by 2026. Coupled with mass deportations, that slowdown in immigration could prompt population growth to drop 0.2% that year.\n\nJennifer Babaie, director of advocacy and legal services at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said she expects it \u201cto be much more difficult for folks to apply for anything\u201d in the coming years, ultimately reducing the number of people who successfully immigrate to the US legally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting delays, both because personnel in the court has dropped and also because (immigration and customs) personnel and funding is at risk,\u201d Babaie said. \u201cWe\u2019re also now spending hours going into detention just trying to interview folks to understand what is going on because we\u2019re not getting any information or cooperation from the administration, and that cuts into the time that we could be working on a complicated brief.\u201d\n\nThe economic impact of Trump\u2019s crackdown\n\nThere were 47.8 million immigrants in the United States in 2023, with a total of $1.7 trillion in spending power and who paid about $652 billion in taxes, according the American Immigration Council. That economic might is at risk from Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nThe Allianz Trade forecast estimates that Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal and legal immigration could drag down GDP to an annualized growth rate of below 2% by 2026. The Brookings Institution estimates that growth could be 0.4 percentage-point lower this year, if Trump continues to restrict legal immigration and manages to conduct 3.4 million deportations. On the campaign trail, Trump said he wants to deport \u201cprobably 15 million and maybe as many as 20 million\u201d people, which would be a complicated and costly undertaking.\n\nImmigrants comprise more than 20% of employment in agriculture, construction, transportation, warehousing, general services and waste services, the American Immigration Council estimates. That means employers in those industries are expected to be in a bind as Trump proceeds with mass deportations and limiting legal immigration.\n\n\u201cThese industries have very tight labor markets, so being very restrictive and aggressive on immigration is not going to give Trump that economic growth and success that he wants,\u201d said Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the intersection of immigration and labor.\n\nPeri said that labor shortages, spurred by a clamp-down on immigration, could result in rising prices for food, housing and tourism. He added that immigration labor is essential also because of the country\u2019s changing demographics.\n\n\u201cIn a situation in which there are going to be many more Americans retiring, more immigration would really benefit the labor market and the growth in the economy,\u201d Peri said.",

                "text": "Montgomery, Alabama AP \u2014\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey commuted the death sentence of Robin \u201cRocky\u201d Myers to life in prison Friday, saying there were enough questions about his guilt that she could not move forward with his execution.\n\nIvey said Myers, 63, will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole instead of being executed later this year. Ivey noted that was the sentence jurors recommended at his 1994 trial.\n\nThe Republican governor said she is a staunch supporter of the death penalty but \u201cI have enough questions about Mr. Myers\u2019 guilt that I cannot move forward with executing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, I am not convinced that Mr. Myers is innocent, but I am not so convinced of his guilt as to approve of his execution. I therefore must respect both the jury\u2019s decision to convict him and its recommendation that he be sentenced to life without parole,\u201d Ivey said in a statement.\n\nMyers was convicted of capital murder in the 1991 stabbing of Ludie Mae Tucker, 69, at her Decatur home. Myers, who lived across the street from Tucker, has long maintained he is innocent, and a juror at his 1994 trial supported the push for clemency.\n\nThe reprieve came over the objections of Republican Attorney General Steve Marshall, who said he was \u201castonished\u201d by the decision.\n\nLast week the Alabama Supreme Court granted the state attorney general\u2019s request to authorize an execution date for Myers using nitrogen gas. The next step was for Ivey to set that date.\n\nIt was the first execution Ivey has stopped since she first took office in 2017. Ivey, who has presided over more than 20 executions, called it \u201cone of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve had to make as governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I pray that the Tucker family may, in some way, find closure and peace knowing this case is closed, and Mr. Myers will spend the rest of his life in prison,\u201d Ivey said.\n\nThere were multiple questions surrounding Myers\u2019 case, his attorney had argued. No physical evidence at the scene connected him to the crime. Tucker identified her assailant as a short, stocky Black man but did not name Myers or a neighbor as the attacker even though they had met several times, according to Myers\u2019 son.\n\nJurors voted 9-3 that he serve life in prison. However, the judge sentenced Myers to death under Alabama\u2019s now-abolished system that let judges decide death sentences.\n\nIvey said there was \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d against Myers, but it is \u201criddled with conflicting evidence from seemingly everyone involved.\u201d Much of the state\u2019s case involved a VCR taken from Tucker\u2019s home and whether Myers was the person who brought it to a drug house to sell, according to court records.\n\n\u201cGod is answering prayers,\u201d juror Mae Puckett, who now believes Myers is innocent and had urged Ivey to intervene.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ivey put it back into the jury\u2019s hands,\u201d Puckett wrote.\n\nKacey Keeton, a lawyer for Myers, had said that there were multiple failures in Myers\u2019 case, including how an earlier attorney abandoned his case, causing him to miss a deadline to raise issues in federal court. Myers, who is a Black, was convicted by a nearly all-white jury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there are words enough to convey my joy, relief, and gratitude at learning of Gov. Ivey\u2019s decision to commute Mr. Myers\u2019s sentence,\u201d Keeton wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cI have represented Mr. Myers since 2007. As evidence accumulated of his innocence and the many injustices he experienced over the course of his case, I held out hope that he would someday see some measure of justice, of mercy, of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe last time an Alabama governor commuted a death sentence was in 1999.\n\nMarshall sent the governor a letter Thursday disputing the innocence claim and urging her to let the execution go forward.\n\n\u201cI am astonished by Governor Ivey\u2019s decision to commute the death sentence of Rocky Myers and am bewildered that she chose not to directly communicate with me about this case or her decision,\u201d Marshall said Friday in a statement.\n\nHe added that his staff \u201cwill go home tonight deeply saddened, not for themselves, but for the family of Ludie Mae Tucker.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nProsecutors are allowed to keep a wealth of evidence in their case against Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in their off-campus home in 2022, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe Idaho judge\u2019s decision to deny defense motions relating to the suppression of different types of evidence is among the latest developments ahead of the trial, which is scheduled to begin in August 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and winding road since the four students \u2013 Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow, Idaho.\n\nKohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. He was charged with four counts of murder; a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf in May 2023, and his attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense.\n\nThe progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings that have frustrated the family of one of the victims as well as the judge overseeing the case.\n\nThe hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case.\n\nKaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were killed in the attack. Obtained by CNN\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial developments and decisions so far:\n\nJune 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of one of the victims came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case.\n\nJune 23, 2023: Latah County Judge John Judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d\n\nAugust 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Kohberger is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr. Kohberger was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing.\n\nOctober 26, 2023: The judge denied a request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions.\n\nDecember 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire.\n\nFebruary 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger.\n\nGenetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene, according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing.\n\nThe judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper.\n\nApril 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first.\n\nJudge said he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings.\n\nApril 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow on the night of the slayings.\n\nApril 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them.\n\nApril 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the killings.\n\nMay 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public.\n\nAfter the hearing, the family of Goncalves, one of the victims, criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d adding they were \u201cincredibly frustrated.\u201d\n\nMay 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting.\n\nMay 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case.\n\nCpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings.\n\nThe probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings.\n\nSy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense.\n\n\u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said.\n\nJune 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed \u201cdefense investigators\u201d to view the material.\n\nJune 27, 2024: The parties set a trial date of June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing.\n\n\u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d he said.\n\nJuly 22, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense team filed a memorandum in support of moving the case out of Latah County, saying he can\u2019t receive a fair trial there \u201cbecause of the extensive publicity that is ongoing and inflammatory.\u201d The defense suggested the trial be moved to Ada County, which includes Boise, about 300 miles south.\n\nAugust 13, 2024: Prosecutors objected to the defense team\u2019s change of venue motion, arguing the defense failed to prove that Kohberger would not receive a fair trial in the county. \u201cThe Court should deny Defendant\u2019s motion and instead, focus on crafting remedial measures to ensure that a fair and impartial jury can be seated in Latah County,\u201d the prosecution argued.\n\nAugust 19, 2024: In a reply to the state\u2019s objection, Kohberger\u2019s defense said moving the venue to Ada County is supported by expert analysis, precedent and results of a survey in Latah County showing a \u201cmob mentality.\u201d \u201cThe traumatized town of Moscow is understandably filled with deeply held prejudgment opinions of guilt,\u201d the defense wrote.\n\nAugust 29, 2024: At a hearing on the change of venue request, four expert witnesses testified for the defense about potential biases among the local jury pool. The prosecution did not call any witnesses.\n\nSeptember 5, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense team filed 13 motions aimed at removing the death penalty from his case.\n\nAttorneys argued the death penalty is unconstitutional because it violates international human rights law and prevents the right to a speedy trial. They said the methods used to put inmates to death in Idaho equate to cruel and unusual punishment and the practice violates the public\u2019s evolving standards of decency. Kohberger could be executed by firing squad if he\u2019s sentenced to death \u2013 and if the state cannot obtain the drugs necessary for a lethal injection. The court has set October 10 as the deadline for the state\u2019s response.\n\nSeptember 9, 2024: Judge John Judge granted the defense motion to move the trial out of Latah County due to concerns the local community is prejudiced against him.\n\n\u201cConsidering the undisputed evidence presented by the defense, the extreme nature of the news coverage in this case, and the smaller population in Latah County, the defense has met the rather low standard of demonstrating \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that prejudicial news coverage will compromise a fair trial in Latah County,\u201d the judge wrote. The judge also highlighted logistical issues with holding such a high-profile case in Latah County.\n\nSeptember 12, 2024: The Idaho Supreme Court ruled to move Kohberger\u2019s trial to Ada County, which surrounds the capital city of Boise and is the most populous county in the state. District Judge Steve Hippler will take on the case, the court ruled.\n\nSeptember 26, 2024: The new judge in the case told lawyers he was weighing whether to change the trial date. Ada County District Judge Steve Hippler would prefer to move the trial \u2013 scheduled to start in June \u2013 to either May or September, because he anticipated issues with keeping a jury intact during a lengthy summer trial, he told prosecutors and defense attorneys during his first hearing in the case.\n\nThe gag order that was issued when the case was in Latah County would remain in place, Hippler also said.\n\nOctober 9, 2024: Hippler, the Ada County district judge, moved Kohberger\u2019s trial date two months later, setting it to begin August 11, 2025. The voir dire portion of the jury selection process will start July 30, 2025, Hippler ordered.\n\nNovember, 7, 2024: Hippler said he is considering several motions filed by the defense to have the death penalty dismissed in this case. The defense argued the death penalty violates Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights, which protect him from cruel and unusual punishment, and it violates international law. Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said the death penalty creates a potential conflict with his constitutional rights to effective counsel and a speedy trial, among other concerns.\n\nThe court said it will issue written decisions for these motions at an unspecified later date.\n\nNovember 15, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense team filed 13 motions asking to suppress evidence from information obtained through multiple warrants. The information, which includes cell phone records, internet data and searches of his car and parents\u2019 house, has constitutional issues and was obtained through the use of investigative genetic genealogy, his team said. The use of investigative genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger is a longstanding issue in the case.\n\nThe defense also requested a hearing to discuss the motions.\n\nNovember 20, 2024: Hippler, the Ada County district judge, allowed prosecutors to continue to pursue the death penalty against Kohberger, denying the defense\u2019s motions on the issue. Defense attorneys in September filed 13 motions arguing against the death penalty, saying it would violate Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights, protecting him from cruel and unusual punishment, and would violate international law, among other concerns.\n\nHippler addressed the defense\u2019s arguments in his order, saying none of them are strong enough to counter existing case law and precedent.\n\nJanuary 23 and 24, 2025: During a motions hearing, Kohberger\u2019s defense team called for the suppression of evidence stemming from the investigative genetic genealogy process, claiming it\u2019s a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. They also called for suppression of cell phone records for the same reason.\n\nThe defense also requested a Frank\u2019s hearing, which would determine whether law enforcement intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in their original search warrant affidavit. Defense attorney Anne Taylor argued important facts were left out of the affidavit, including that unknown male DNA was found mixed with Kohberger\u2019s DNA on a handrail at the house, and another unknown male DNA sample was found on a glove outside the house. She also noted no DNA found at the crime scene was found in Kohberger\u2019s car or on his steering wheel.\n\nJudge Steven Hippler said the unknown male DNA doesn\u2019t exclude Kohberger, but might indicate someone else was involved. Kohberger\u2019s DNA on the knife sheath alone establishes probable cause for arrest, Hippler said.\n\nThe prosecution argued probable cause was established that Kohberger committed crimes and therefore all warrants were valid.\n\nHippler did not immediately make a decision. If a false statement is found, it means Kohberger\u2019s case could potentially be dismissed.\n\nFebruary 19, 2025: Judge Hippler denied a motion to suppress critical DNA evidence, allowing the investigative genetic genealogy process to remain in evidence, ruling the defense did not show Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nMultiple motions from Kohberger\u2019s defense team requesting the suppression of information obtained through warrants to AT&T, Google, Amazon and others were also denied, as well as an arrest warrant and several other search warrants, saying that the defense did not meet the standard needed for exclusion.\n\nHippler also denied a request for a Franks hearing, which would have determined whether law enforcement intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in their original search warrant affidavit. In his order, he said the standards needed for that hearing were not met.\n\nFebruary 21, 2025: New details emerged after a judge unsealed a partially redacted transcript from a hearing originally closed to the public, giving an inside look at the fight to use investigative genetic genealogy in the case. Judge Hippler ultimately allowed the evidence to be used.\n\nThe prosecution filed a motion requesting to use a model of the house where the stabbings occurred during the trial. In a series of filings, the prosecution also asked the judge to bar the admission of certain defenses, including use of an alibi and claiming there was another perpetrator, without sharing evidence first. They also asked that certain expert testimony on Kohberger\u2019s mental health \u2013 which is currently sealed and not viewable by the public \u2013 not be allowed.\n\nFebruary 24, 2025: Attorneys for Kohberger nodded to autism spectrum disorder in filing a motion \u201cto Strike Death Penalty RE: Autism Spectrum Disorder,\u201d summaries of court documents show. A \u201cMotion to Redact or Seal Newly Filed Records\u201d was also entered. The motions mark the latest attempt by Kohberger\u2019s attorneys to try to remove the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nFebruary 28, 2025: Fourth Judicial District Judge Steven Hippler ordered a temporary seal Friday on all filings related to the February 24 motion filed by Kohberger nodding to autism spectrum disorder in asking the court to strike his death penalty option if convicted.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA lawyer for Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of killing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO last year, is attempting to throw out evidence taken from his backpack and other belongings collected during his arrest, arguing he was illegally stopped and searched by police.\n\nIn a motion filed last week in a Pennsylvania court, Mangione\u2019s lawyer Thomas Dickey said he seeks to toss more than two dozen items, including a 3D-printed gun, a fake driver\u2019s license, and a notebook collected by police when Mangione was arrested at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Altoona following an intense manhunt.\n\nThe filing reveals for the first time specific details of local police\u2019s confrontation and arrest of Mangione and a detailed list of the materials found in his backpack.\n\nThe notebook, gun and false identification are key pieces of evidence that authorities allege tie Mangione to the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in midtown Manhattan on December 4. The notebook allegedly refers to the investor conference Thompson was set to attend and contained \u201cseveral handwritten pages that express hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular.\u201d The fake New Jersey drivers\u2019 license matched the one used to book a room at the New York hostel, prosecutors have said.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, Mangione faces firearm and forgery charges in connection to the 3D-printed firearm and false ID allegedly in his possession when he was arrested in Altoona.\n\nDickey argues in his motion that Altoona police illegally searched Mangione\u2019s backpack and took other items without a search warrant. Altoona police officers approached Mangione when we has sitting at a table in McDonald\u2019s saying he \u201clooked suspicious\u201d and had stayed too long inside the restaurant. The attorney said the officers then frisked Mangione, took his backpack and other items, and blocked him from leaving the McDonald\u2019s.\n\nMangione was questioned by officers, was not read his Miranda rights or \u201cgiven any information as to why he was being held,\u201d for more than 15 minutes, Dickey wrote.\n\nLater, Mangione was asked his name and read his Miranda rights, the attorney said. Police then arrested Mangione.\n\nThe motion provides a detailed list of other materials found in Mangione\u2019s backpack or in his possession. Those items include a suspected 3D-printed silencer, written notes, a laptop, two jackets, face masks, a US passport, a fake New Jersey driver\u2019s license, currency and multiple USB electronic storage devices, including one on a necklace, according to the petition.\n\nMangione\u2019s attorneys are planning to make a similar request for his New York state case.\n\nAt a hearing last week, Mangione\u2019s defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo said she would seek to exclude the evidence for the New York case, and Judge Gregory Carro ordered motions to be filed in April.\n\nIn New York, Mangione faces 11 counts, including one of murder in the first-degree and two of murder in the second-degree in Thompson\u2019s killing, along with other weapon and forgery charges. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nIf convicted of the New York charges, Mangione could face a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is also facing federal charges, including one count of using a firearm to commit murder. Though prosecutors have not yet indicated they plan to seek it, Mangione could face the death penalty if found guilty of the federal murder charge.",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nA jury found an Illinois landlord guilty of murder and hate crime charges Friday for the brutal killing of a 6-year-old whose mother rented rooms in the man\u2019s home, an attack that spiked fears over anti-Muslim discrimination in the earliest days of the war in Gaza.\n\nJoseph Czuba, 73, was charged in the fatal stabbing of Wadee Alfayoumi and the wounding of his mother, Hanan Shaheen on Oct. 14, 2023 in Plainfield, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Chicago. Authorities alleged the family was targeted because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 90 minutes before returning with the verdict.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be pleased or upset, if I should be crying or laughing,\u201d Wadee\u2019s father, Odai Alfayoumi, said at a news conference, speaking in Arabic. \u201cPeople are telling me to smile. Maybe if I were one of you, I would be smiling, but I\u2019m the father of the child and I\u2019ve lost the child. And I feel like this decision came to a little too late.\u201d\n\nBen Crump, the national civil rights attorney representing Shaheen, released a statement calling the verdict a \u201cmeasure of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWadee was an innocent six-year-old child whose life was stolen in an act of unimaginable violence fueled by hatred,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWhile we are relieved that his killer has been held accountable, we must continue to stand against the rising tide of hate that led to this senseless act. We must honor Wadee\u2019s memory by continuing to fight against hate in all its forms and working toward a future where every child is safe, valued, and free from violence.\u201d\n\nCrump asked that the media continue respecting Shaheen\u2019s privacy as she honors her son\u2019s memory.\n\nShaheen did not speak at a press conference following the jury decision. Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR-Chicago, said it was too difficult for her and added that she \u201conly prays for peace and love.\u201d\n\nThe trial featured detailed testimony from police officers, medical workers, Czuba\u2019s ex-wife and Shaheen, who described how Czuba attacked her with a knife before going after her son in a different room. Prosecutors say that the child had been stabbed 26 times. He was found naked with a knife still in his side.\n\nGraphic photos of the murder, a knife holder Czuba allegedly used that day, along with police video footage were central to the Will County prosecutors\u2019 case. At times video screens showing explicit footage were turned away from the public viewing audience where members of Wadee\u2019s family sat during the trial.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy\u2019s body,\u201d Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state\u2019s attorney, told jurors during opening statements.\n\nCzuba\u2019s attorney, George Lenard, declined comment Friday. Czuba had pleaded not guilty. He faced murder, attempted murder, aggravated battery and hate crime charges in an eight-count indictment.\n\nCzuba is scheduled for sentencing on May 2, according to the Will County Circuit Clerk\u2019s office.\n\nDefense attorneys insisted pieces of evidence tying Czuba to the crimes were missing. His ex-wife, testifying for the prosecution, could only describe one outburst during their 30 years of marriage and said he carried knives often because he was handy around the house.\n\n\u201cGo beyond the emotions to carefully examine the evidence,\u201d said Kylie Blatti, one of Czuba\u2019s public defenders. \u201cIt is easy to get lost in the horror of those images.\u201d\n\nOne of the critical parts of the trial was Shaheen\u2019s testimony and the 911 call she made to report the crime that happened just days after the war started. She said they had not previously had any issues in the two years they rented from the Czubas. They shared a kitchen and living room with the Czubas.\n\nThen after the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. Later, he confronted Shaheen and attacked her, holding her down, stabbing her and trying to break her teeth.\n\n\u201cHe told me \u2019You, as a Muslim, must die,\u201d said Shaheen, who testified in English and Arabic though a translator.\n\nShaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover. The boy was later pronounced dead.\n\nPolice testified that officers found Czuba outside the house sitting on the ground with blood on his body and hands.\n\nSeparately, civil lawsuits have been filed over the boy\u2019s death, including by his father, Alfayoumi, who is divorced from Shaheen and was not living with them.\n\nThe case generated headlines around the world and struck deeply for the Chicago area\u2019s large and established Palestinian community. The U.S. Department of Justice also launched a federal hate crimes investigation.\n\n\u201cAll of us who are parents, who are Arab or Palestinian \u2026 who are Muslim, we all saw our children die in Wadee Alfayoumi, because this could have been any one of our boys, any one of our girls,\u201d CAIR-Chicago\u2019s Rehab said. \u201cIt just so happened that it was Wadee Alfayoumi. When he was targeted, all of our children were targeted. Every Muslim was targeted when he (Czuba) yelled, \u2018All Muslims must die.\u2019\u201d",

                "text": "Des Moines, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa became the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code on Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life.\n\nThe new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender students\u2019 use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections.\n\nThe law also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn\u2019t make it to a vote of the full House or Senate.\n\n\u201cWomen and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences. That\u2019s not controversial, it\u2019s common sense,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that defining a woman in code has become necessary to protect spaces where women\u2019s health, safety, and privacy are being threatened.\u201d She added that such spaces included domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House and Senate.\n\nFive House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate in voting against the bill. Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \u201cI transitioned to save my life.\u201d\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds gives an update on her rural health care bill on Tuesday, February 18, 2025. Cody Scanlan/The Des Moines Register/USA Today Network/Imagn Images\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d\n\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including, \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional.\n\nNot every state includes gender identity in their civil rights code, but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.\n\nThe House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Rep. Steven Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove them.\n\nAs of July 1, Iowa\u2019s civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.\n\nAdvocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court.\n\nKeenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it \u201chard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will pursue any legal options available to us,\u201d Crow said.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIsrael inform\u00f3 este domingo que detuvo la entrada de toda ayuda humanitaria en Gaza hasta que Hamas acepte una extensi\u00f3n del acuerdo de alto el fuego respaldado por Estados Unidos, despu\u00e9s de que la fase uno del acuerdo expirara el s\u00e1bado.\n\nLa oficina del primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, dijo que apoyaba una propuesta de EE.UU. para extender temporalmente el alto el fuego actual durante el mes sagrado isl\u00e1mico de Ramad\u00e1n y la festividad jud\u00eda de Pascua, que prev\u00e9 la liberaci\u00f3n de la mitad de los rehenes retenidos en Gaza el d\u00eda en que comience el acuerdo.\n\nHamas, que busca la retirada de Israel de Gaza, rechaz\u00f3 inmediatamente el plan, al decir que Netanyahu y su gobierno estaban llevando a cabo \u201cun flagrante golpe contra el acuerdo de alto el fuego\u201d que ya se hab\u00eda acordado.\n\nIsrael actu\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente cuando Hamas rechaz\u00f3 la propuesta, y escal\u00f3 un estancamiento sobre una tregua que puso fin a meses de combates en Gaza.\n\nLa oficina de Netanyahu dijo este domingo que \u201cdada la negativa de Hamas a aceptar el marco [del enviado de EE.UU. Steve] Witkoff para continuar las negociaciones \u2014 al que Israel hab\u00eda accedido \u2014 el primer ministro Netanyahu ha decidido que a partir de esta ma\u00f1ana, se detendr\u00e1 la entrada de mercanc\u00edas y suministros a Gaza\u201d.\n\nLa Oficina del Primer Ministro de Israel advirti\u00f3 de \u201cconsecuencias adicionales\u201d si Hamas contin\u00faa rechazando la propuesta. Israel no permitir\u00eda un alto el fuego sin la liberaci\u00f3n de los rehenes restantes, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 el comunicado.\n\nHamas dijo que la decisi\u00f3n de Israel de detener la ayuda humanitaria a Gaza equivale a \u201cchantaje barato\u201d y a un \u201ccrimen de guerra\u201d, e hizo un llamado a los mediadores para presionar a Israel para que ponga fin a sus \u201cmedidas punitivas e inmorales\u201d.\n\nNo ha habido noticias del propio Witkoff ni del Gobierno de Trump sobre el plan revisado, ni sobre la afirmaci\u00f3n de Israel de que la suspensi\u00f3n de la ayuda a Gaza fue acordada con Washington. Tambi\u00e9n es incierto si los otros mediadores del acuerdo de alto el fuego y rehenes \u2014Catar y Egipto\u2014 est\u00e1n al tanto del plan revisado.\n\nLa primera fase del alto el fuego en Gaza, en virtud del cual se liber\u00f3 a decenas de rehenes israel\u00edes y a cientos de prisioneros y detenidos palestinos, lleg\u00f3 este s\u00e1bado a su fecha de expiraci\u00f3n.\n\nLos israel\u00edes quieren que contin\u00fae la primera fase: el intercambio de rehenes, vivos y fallecidos, a cambio de la liberaci\u00f3n continuada de prisioneros y detenidos palestinos, y el flujo de mayores vol\u00famenes de ayuda a Gaza. Se cree que 24 rehenes israel\u00edes siguen vivos en Gaza.\n\nHamas busca negociaciones para un alto el fuego permanente y la retirada completa de las tropas israel\u00edes de Gaza bajo la segunda etapa de la tregua, acusando a Israel de \u201cmanipulaci\u00f3n continua\u201d con su propuesta de extensi\u00f3n de la fase uno.\n\nEl ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Israel, Gideon Sa\u2019ar, dijo que Israel estaba preparado para continuar las negociaciones \u201cincluida la segunda fase\u201d a cambio de la liberaci\u00f3n de rehenes, pero estipul\u00f3 que no hab\u00eda \u201ctransici\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica entre fases\u201d bajo el acuerdo inicial.\n\n\u201cComo la primera fase del marco ha terminado, hemos detenido la entrada de camiones en Gaza. No lo har\u00edamos gratis\u201d, dijo Sa\u2019ar en una conferencia de prensa este domingo.\n\nAyuda vital para Gaza\n\nCasi 17 meses de guerra en Gaza han reducido gran parte del enclave a escombros, han matado a m\u00e1s de 45.000 personas y han creado unas condiciones de vida terribles para casi todos sus residentes.\n\nEl enclave depende casi exclusivamente de la ayuda humanitaria, y las agencias de ayuda advirtieron el mes pasado que las necesidades humanitarias de los habitantes de Gaza siguen siendo enormes, a pesar de la promesa de una gran afluencia de ayuda bajo la fase uno del acuerdo. Los reportes desde Gaza este domingo indicaron un fuerte aumento en el precio de algunos productos.\n\nA\u00f1adiendo a la sensaci\u00f3n de que la tregua est\u00e1 en peligro, cuatro personas murieron por operaciones militares israel\u00edes en Gaza este domingo, dijo el ministerio de salud.\n\nEl Ej\u00e9rcito de Israel ha continuado operando dentro de Gaza desde que comenz\u00f3 el alto el fuego el 19 de enero, pero ha habido un marcado descenso en las muertes.\n\nEl acuerdo original de alto el fuego estipula que la tregua puede continuar mientras los negociadores est\u00e9n hablando.\n\nUna delegaci\u00f3n israel\u00ed regres\u00f3 abruptamente de El Cairo el viernes, un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de llegar a la capital egipcia. Una fuente israel\u00ed familiarizada con el asunto declar\u00f3 a CNN en la semana que Israel estaba intentando prolongar la primera fase del acuerdo \u201ctodo lo posible\u201d con la esperanza de liberar a m\u00e1s rehenes. La mayor\u00eda de los rehenes fueron tomados durante el ataque dirigido por Hamas contra Israel del 7 de octubre de 2023, que desencaden\u00f3 el bombardeo israel\u00ed de Gaza.\n\nEn un aparente intento de aumentar la presi\u00f3n sobre Israel, Hamas difundi\u00f3 el s\u00e1bado un video propagand\u00edstico en el que se mostraban rehenes israel\u00edes en Gaza, incluida una escena del reci\u00e9n liberado cautivo Iair Horn despidi\u00e9ndose de su hermano Eitan, que permanece en cautividad tras 512 d\u00edas.\n\nLa familia de Iair y Eitan autoriz\u00f3 el uso del video por parte de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan inform\u00f3 la sede del Foro de Familiares de Rehenes y Desaparecidos en un comunicado: \u201cExigimos a los responsables: miren a Eitan a los ojos. No detengan el acuerdo que ya nos ha devuelto a decenas de rehenes. \u00a1Se les acaba el tiempo! Traigan a todos a casa, ahora, en una sola fase\u201d, dec\u00eda.\n\nLa Oficina del primer ministro israel\u00ed conden\u00f3 el video como una cruel \u201cguerra psicol\u00f3gica\u201d.\n\nEl alto el fuego entr\u00f3 en vigor en enero. En total fueron liberados 33 rehenes israel\u00edes -entre ellos dos hombres retenidos en Gaza durante una d\u00e9cada-, as\u00ed como cinco ciudadanos tailandeses que trabajaban en un kibbutz del sur de Israel cuando fueron tomados como rehenes. Se devolvieron ocho cad\u00e1veres. Entre ellos se encontraban los restos de Shiri Bibas y sus dos hijos peque\u00f1os, un momento muy emotivo para los israel\u00edes.\n\nIsrael liber\u00f3 a un total de 1.737 presos y detenidos palestinos, entre ellos 120 mujeres y ni\u00f1os. Unos 1.000 de los excarcelados hab\u00edan sido detenidos tras los atentados del 7 de octubre; otros cumpl\u00edan largas condenas, incluso cadena perpetua. Algunos llevaban d\u00e9cadas en c\u00e1rceles israel\u00edes.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nLos consumidores estadounidenses no necesitan preocuparse de que los aranceles al aluminio del presidente Donald Trump aumenten el precio de sus latas de refresco\n\nHace dos semanas, Trump anunci\u00f3 un arancel del 25% a todas las importaciones de acero y aluminio a Estados Unidos que entrar\u00eda en vigor el 12 de marzo, preocupando a algunos bebedores de gaseosas del impacto en estos productos.\n\nPero poco despu\u00e9s del decreto, las empresas de bebidas comenzaron a evaluar lo que los aranceles podr\u00edan significar para su industria y los resultados no fueron demasiado preocupantes.\n\nEl director ejecutivo de Coca-Cola, James Quincey, sugiri\u00f3 que la compa\u00f1\u00eda podr\u00eda dejar de usar aluminio y aumentar la producci\u00f3n de otros materiales de envasado para garantizar la asequibilidad y satisfacer la demanda de los consumidores.\n\n\u201cSi las latas de aluminio se vuelven m\u00e1s caras, podemos poner m\u00e1s \u00e9nfasis en las botellas (de pl\u00e1stico)\u201d, dijo Quincey en la conferencia telef\u00f3nica sobre los resultados del cuarto trimestre de la compa\u00f1\u00eda el 11 de febrero.\n\nLos aranceles probablemente no tendr\u00e1n casi ning\u00fan impacto en los precios al consumidor, seg\u00fan Adam S. Hersh, economista s\u00e9nior del Instituto de Pol\u00edtica Econ\u00f3mica.\n\n\u201cLas corporaciones tienen m\u00e1rgenes de ganancia m\u00e1s que suficientes para absorber peque\u00f1os aumentos de precios con una peque\u00f1a inversi\u00f3n en la producci\u00f3n\u201d, dijo.\n\nEn 2023, los datos mostraron que Coca-Cola Company envas\u00f3 casi el 50% de sus bebidas en botellas de pl\u00e1stico, el 25% en latas de aluminio y el 25% restante en botellas de vidrio y otros envases. Los datos de Keurig DrPepper mostraron que envasaron el 27% de sus bebidas en botellas de pl\u00e1stico, el 13% en latas de aluminio y el 8% en vidrio.\n\nQuincey tambi\u00e9n dej\u00f3 en claro que si bien los aranceles al aluminio probablemente resulten en un costo adicional, es poco probable que tengan un impacto significativo en las corporaciones de bebidas del tama\u00f1o de Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cCreo que corremos el riesgo de exagerar el impacto del aumento del 25% del precio del aluminio en relaci\u00f3n con el sistema total. No es insignificante, pero no va a cambiar radicalmente un negocio multimillonario en Estados Unidos\u201d, afirm\u00f3.\n\n\u201cEs un costo que habr\u00e1 que gestionar. Ser\u00eda mejor que no tuviera relaci\u00f3n con el negocio, pero vamos a gestionarlo\u201d.\n\nSeg\u00fan Hersh, producir una lata cuesta un poco menos de 4 centavos. \u201cSi le aplicamos un arancel del 25%, el costo de la lata aumentar\u00eda a 5 centavos\u201d, dijo, y agreg\u00f3 que eso aumentar\u00eda el costo de producci\u00f3n de un paquete de seis en 6 centavos.\n\nLos inversores coinciden en gran medida en que los aranceles al aluminio no resultar\u00e1n en aumentos de costos significativos, y los precios de las acciones de las corporaciones de bebidas se han mantenido relativamente estables desde que se anunciaron, seg\u00fan Hersh.\n\nLos embotelladores toman decisiones sobre el envasado\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de las empresas de bebidas subcontratan el envasado a embotelladores y son estos \u00faltimos quienes compran el aluminio en bruto y, en \u00faltima instancia, deciden los precios y la estrategia, afirma Filippo Falorni, analista de bebidas de Citi.\n\nCoca-Cola vende su concentrado a embotelladores, quienes lo mezclan con agua y lo envasan en l\u00edneas de producci\u00f3n que son intercambiables.\n\n\u201cEs bastante f\u00e1cil cambiar las l\u00edneas de producci\u00f3n de latas a botellas\u201d, dijo Falorni.\n\nProductos Coca-Cola en una tienda de comestibles en Miami Beach, Florida, en mayo de 2022. Jeffrey Greenberg/Grupo Universal Images/Getty Images\n\nAumentar el uso de envases de pl\u00e1stico en lugar de aluminio es principalmente una estrategia de mitigaci\u00f3n de costos, dada la facilidad de cambiar las l\u00edneas de producci\u00f3n, y no necesariamente debido a los precios prohibitivamente altos del aluminio, dijo.\n\nPero cambiar a otros tipos de envases podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s complicado para las empresas de bebidas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as y las que envasan internamente, como inform\u00f3 anteriormente CNN.\n\nDejar de usar latas de aluminio puede ser \u201cuna decisi\u00f3n colosal\u201d y \u201cnormalmente lleva varios a\u00f1os hacer una transici\u00f3n como esa con \u00e9xito\u201d, dijo William Pietersen, profesor de la Escuela de Negocios de Columbia y exdirector ejecutivo de Lever Foods, Seagram USA y Tropicana.\n\nDesde que Trump anunci\u00f3 los nuevos aranceles, los precios del aluminio han subido m\u00e1s del 4%, lo que Hersh calific\u00f3 de \u201crelativamente estable\u201d.\n\nLa Coalici\u00f3n de Fabricantes y Usuarios de Metales de Estados Unidos (CAMMU) dijo que los aranceles del 25% sobre el acero y el aluminio podr\u00edan perjudicar directamente a los fabricantes nacionales.\n\n\u201cReimponer aranceles del 25% a las importaciones de acero y aluminio de nuestros aliados y sin un proceso de exclusi\u00f3n viable pone a los fabricantes estadounidenses en peligro directo\u201d, seg\u00fan una declaraci\u00f3n de CAMMU.\n\n\u201cLos clientes extranjeros est\u00e1n desviando sus cadenas de suministro de los productores estadounidenses. Una vez que se eliminan, especialmente para las empresas familiares m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as, es dif\u00edcil recuperar ese negocio perdido\u201d, se lee en el comunicado.\n\nEn 2024, Estados Unidos import\u00f3 alrededor del 47% del aluminio consumido internamente, seg\u00fan el Servicio Geol\u00f3gico de Estados Unidos.\n\nDiferentes estrategias\n\nPero al combinar los aranceles del primer mandato de Trump, el precio del aluminio comercializado en el mercado y la producci\u00f3n nacional de aluminio han experimentado un impacto real en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, dijo Falorni.\n\nDentro de la industria de bebidas, las empresas se adaptan a los aumentos de precios de diferentes maneras.\n\nEmpresas como Coca-Cola, cuyos ingresos de Estados Unidos significan solo un 25%, pueden compensar el aumento de los costos aprovechando las ganancias de otros mercados.\n\nEsta flexibilidad hace que la empresa sea menos vulnerable a los aranceles al aluminio que empresas como Keurig Dr Pepper, que depende en gran medida del mercado estadounidense y est\u00e1 m\u00e1s expuesta a las fluctuaciones de los precios internos, dijo Falorni.\n\nAunque aproximadamente una cuarta parte de los productos Coca-Cola vienen en latas de aluminio, los consumidores tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n acostumbrados a las botellas de pl\u00e1stico y vidrio.\n\nLas bebidas energ\u00e9ticas como Monster y las gaseosas como White-Claw se venden principalmente en latas, con pocas alternativas viables. Para estas marcas, el cambio a otros materiales podr\u00eda perjudicar la demanda, dej\u00e1ndolas con pocas opciones m\u00e1s que trasladar los mayores costos a los consumidores, seg\u00fan Falorni.\n\nImpacto ambiental\n\nSi bien el cambio a envases de pl\u00e1stico y vidrio tendr\u00eda un impacto financiero menor para las empresas de refrescos como Coca-Cola, podr\u00eda ser \u201cdevastador\u201d para el medio ambiente, seg\u00fan Judith Enck, presidenta de Beyond Plastics y ex administradora regional de la Agencia de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental.\n\n\u201cCualquier cambio significativo hacia un mayor uso de botellas de pl\u00e1stico es un enorme problema ambiental\u201d, dijo Enck a CNN.\n\nLos envases de vidrio rellenables son la opci\u00f3n de envasado m\u00e1s sostenible para las empresas de bebidas, seguidos de las latas de aluminio (porque se pueden reciclar f\u00e1cilmente) y las botellas de vidrio de un solo uso. El pl\u00e1stico es uno de los menos sostenibles, ya que se utilizan alrededor de 16.000 productos qu\u00edmicos para producir pl\u00e1sticos, seg\u00fan Enck.\n\nLas botellas de Coca-Cola son la principal fuente de contaminaci\u00f3n pl\u00e1stica del mundo. En diciembre, la empresa anunci\u00f3 una reducci\u00f3n dr\u00e1stica de sus objetivos de sostenibilidad en materia de envases.\n\nLas corporaciones de bebidas probablemente no sentir\u00e1n muchas cr\u00edticas por parte de la administraci\u00f3n Trump si eligen envases menos sustentables.\n\n\u201cLa administraci\u00f3n Trump est\u00e1 enviando un mensaje muy claro de que no prioriza la protecci\u00f3n del medio ambiente\u201d, dijo Enck.\n\n\u201cNo creo que las grandes empresas sientan ninguna presi\u00f3n para cambiar\u201d.\n\nJordan Valinsky y Alicia Wallace de CNN contribuyeron a este informe.",

Hackman quer\u00eda conocer a Daniel, as\u00ed que los cuatro fueron a almorzar juntos y se llevaron bien de inmediato, \u201cy fue historia desde all\u00ed\u201d, dijo Barbara.\n\nElla y Arakawa cofundaron Pandora\u2019s, una tienda de decoraci\u00f3n y muebles para el hogar en Santa Fe que presenta telas de todo el mundo, as\u00ed como el trabajo de artesanos locales. Las dos amigas se inspiraron para lanzar el negocio despu\u00e9s de que Hackman regresara de Europa central, donde estaba filmando una pel\u00edcula en 2001 y trajera de vuelta \u201chermosos cojines de lino\u201d, dijo Barbara.\n\nLa \u00faltima vez que vio a Arakawa fue hace tres semanas en Pandora\u2019s, pero dijo que la pareja no ven\u00eda a la ciudad muy a menudo.\n\n\u201cEran muy, bastante aislados, cuando miras las fotos del bosque y su casa, as\u00ed que no era inusual en absoluto no haber o\u00eddo (de ellos)\u201d, dijo Barbara.\n\n\u201c\u00c9l no sal\u00eda mucho. Betsy era una esposa maravillosa. Eran muy cercanos, y ella era una buena cocinera y realmente, realmente lo cuidaba bien\u201d, agreg\u00f3 Barbara. \u201cCom\u00edan muy bien. \u00c9l hab\u00eda tenido un triple bypass, tal vez alrededor de los (60 a\u00f1os), y hab\u00eda estado en muy buena salud desde entonces, y estoy segura de que ella fue uno de esos factores\u201d.\n\nHasta hace un a\u00f1o, Hackman todav\u00eda montaba su bicicleta y Arakawa \u201clo ten\u00eda haciendo yoga y diferentes cosas en casa por Zoom y tratando de mantenerse muy en forma,\u201d dijo Barbara.\n\nCuando la pareja recib\u00eda a los Lenihan en su casa, Hackman a menudo ped\u00eda a Arakawa que tocara piezas cl\u00e1sicas en el piano, y ella era igualmente solidaria con sus logros, dijo Barbara. Les encantaba viajar y eran muy queridos en su comunidad, agreg\u00f3.\n\nGene Hackman, a la derecha, y su amigo de mucho tiempo, Daniel Lenihan, fotografiados en Santa Fe, Nuevo M\u00e9xico en 1999. Sarah Martone/Associated Press\n\nDaniel, quien escribi\u00f3 tres libros con Hackman durante un per\u00edodo de alrededor de 10 a\u00f1os, dijo que lo recordar\u00e1 como un \u201chombre interesante, divertido y muy inteligente\u201d, mientras que Barbara describi\u00f3 a Arakawa como \u201cingeniosa, aguda y divertida\u201d.\n\n\u201cEstamos muy sorprendidos, y no tenemos idea de lo que sucedi\u00f3, pero nunca hubo problemas entre ellos\u201d, dijo Barbara. \u201cNuestro hijo dec\u00eda hoy que tal vez nunca ha visto una pareja tan compatible\u201d.\n\nLa comunidad de Santa Fe honra a la pareja\n\nEl legendario actor, su esposa y su perro fueron encontrados muertos en circunstancias que las autoridades consideraron \u201clo suficientemente sospechosas\u201d como para justificar una exhaustiva investigaci\u00f3n. Los cuerpos de la pareja fueron encontrados en habitaciones separadas en su casa de Santa Fe, con pastillas esparcidas junto a Arakawa, seg\u00fan la Oficina del Sheriff del Condado Santa Fe.\n\nLos datos del marcapasos de Hackman muestran que probablemente estuvo muerto durante nueve d\u00edas antes de que \u00e9l y su esposa fueran encontrados sin vida en su casa de Nuevo M\u00e9xico, dijeron las autoridades.\n\nHackman, de 95 a\u00f1os, fue un actor ganador del Oscar conocido por sus papeles en pel\u00edculas como \u201cThe French Connection\u201d, \u201cHoosiers\u201d, \u201cUnforgiven\u201d y \u201cThe Firm\u201d. Arakawa, tres d\u00e9cadas menor que Hackman, era una pianista cl\u00e1sica.\n\nLas causas de la muerte a\u00fan no se conocen. La pareja no presentaba traumatismos externos ni se\u00f1ales inmediatas de violencia, seg\u00fan las autopsias preliminares y las autoridades. Tampoco hubo se\u00f1ales inmediatas de una fuga de mon\u00f3xido de carbono o gas natural, dijeron las autoridades.\n\nLa casa donde se encontr\u00f3 a la pareja est\u00e1 en una comunidad cerrada al final de un largo y curvado camino de entrada. Era un hogar adecuado para la aislada estrella, con vistas expansivas de las monta\u00f1as cercanas pero lo suficientemente aislado como para estar en gran medida fuera del alcance del servicio de telefon\u00eda celular.\n\nHackman y Arakawa se mudaron al \u00e1rea de Santa Fe m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada antes de que \u00e9l se retirara efectivamente de la actuaci\u00f3n a los 74 a\u00f1os. \u201cTen\u00eda una especie de magia\u201d, dijo a Architectural Digest en 1990.\n\nFuncionarios de la ley hablan afuera de la casa del actor Gene Hackman el jueves, 27 de febrero de 2025 en Santa Fe, Nuevo M\u00e9xico. Hackman, su esposa Betsy Arakawa y su perro fueron encontrados muertos en la casa un d\u00eda antes. Roberto Rosales/AP\n\nHackman era \u201cun residente muy querido de Nuevo M\u00e9xico\u201d, dijo el jueves la gobernadora de Nuevo M\u00e9xico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, en una publicaci\u00f3n de Facebook, y agreg\u00f3 que viv\u00eda en Santa Fe \u201ccomo un miembro discreto y amigable de nuestra comunidad\u201d y era un vecino querido por muchos.\n\n\u201cLa extraordinaria carrera ganadora del Oscar de Gene trajo personajes a la vida con una autenticidad inigualable, y todos est\u00e1bamos orgullosos de llamarlo nuestro vecino\u201d, dijo Grisham. \u201cNuevo M\u00e9xico lamenta la p\u00e9rdida de este brillante actor y antiguo residente de Nuevo M\u00e9xico. Manny y yo extendemos nuestras condolencias a la familia, amigos y seguidores de Gene en todo el mundo\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrataba a todos bien y con gracia y respeto. Lo mismo con Betsy\u201d, dijo el alcalde de Santa Fe, Alan Webber, a NBC. \u201cEstas son dos personas que tienen un talento enorme, enormes dones, reputaciones globales, y sin embargo aqu\u00ed en Santa Fe son personas sencillas, parte de la comunidad\u201d.\n\nLa pareja a menudo era vista en Santa Fe en sus restaurantes favoritos o en la tienda de Arakawa, y todos en la ciudad tienen \u201cuna historia favorita, un recuerdo favorito, un gran cari\u00f1o y afecto por ambos\u201d, dijo Webber.\n\nHackman, que disfrutaba de la pintura adem\u00e1s de escribir, estaba muy involucrado con el mundo del arte, a menudo regalando arte a amigos.\n\nOtro de los amigos de Hackman, Stuart Ashman, recuerda haberse encontrado con el actor en una reuni\u00f3n de artes comunitarias, un encuentro casual que result\u00f3 en m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os de amistad, seg\u00fan la BBC.\n\nLa pareja tambi\u00e9n asist\u00eda a clases de pilates juntos, y Hackman a menudo se met\u00eda en problemas por hablar demasiado, brome\u00f3 Ashman.\n\n\u201cGene, \u00bfvas a hacer ejercicio o solo quieres hablar con Stuart hoy?\u201d, recuerda Ashman que preguntaba su profesor de pilates.\n\nAshman dijo que criaba gallinas y a menudo llevaba una docena de huevos a Hackman, quien un d\u00eda devolvi\u00f3 el amable gesto con una gran pintura de paisaje que hizo para \u00e9l.\n\n\u201cEra tan sencillo que no te dabas cuenta de que estabas hablando con una celebridad. Estaba m\u00e1s interesado en ti que en contarte sobre s\u00ed mismo\u201d, dijo Ashman a la BBC.\n\nHackman tambi\u00e9n donaba regularmente su arte para subastas, dicen sus amigos.\n\n\u201cAcabamos de ir a una gran subasta de c\u00e1ncer en San Valent\u00edn que ten\u00eda algunas de las piezas m\u00e1s prominentes de artistas donando obras, y Gene siempre donaba una pieza\u201d, agreg\u00f3 Barbara Lenihan. \u201cHace un par de a\u00f1os, ten\u00eda una pieza realmente bonita, ni siquiera sab\u00edamos que lo estaba haciendo, y se re\u00edan diciendo que siempre llegaba corriendo con la pintura a\u00fan h\u00fameda esa tarde para colgarla en la pared\u201d.\n\nEl Museo Georgia O\u2019Keeffe en Santa Fe emiti\u00f3 un comunicado este jueves en el que dec\u00eda estar \u201cprofundamente entristecido\u201d por el fallecimiento de Hackman y Arakawa.\n\n\u201cDe 1997 a 2004, Gene sirvi\u00f3 en la Junta de Fideicomisarios del Museo, desempe\u00f1ando un papel vital en dar forma a los primeros a\u00f1os del Museo\u201d, dec\u00eda el comunicado. \u201cM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su papel como fideicomisario, Gene contribuy\u00f3 al Museo de maneras significativas, notablemente como narrador de la pel\u00edcula de Perry Miller Adato, \u2018Georgia O\u2019Keeffe: A Life in Art\u2019. El Museo est\u00e1 agradecido por su compromiso de compartir el legado de Georgia O\u2019Keeffe y su profundo apoyo a las iniciativas art\u00edsticas y culturales\u201d.\n\nHackman hab\u00eda hablado en la gran inauguraci\u00f3n del Museo O\u2019Keeffe en 1997: \u201cEn los 10 a\u00f1os que he vivido aqu\u00ed, me ha cautivado la emoci\u00f3n y el esp\u00edritu indomable de este lugar\u201d, dijo el actor, seg\u00fan report\u00f3 el Santa Fe New Mexican en 2022.\n\nEn 2011, GQ le pregunt\u00f3 a Hackman c\u00f3mo quer\u00eda ser recordado.\n\n\u201cComo un actor decente. Como alguien que intent\u00f3 representar lo que se le dio de manera honesta\u201d, dijo a la revista. Cuando se le pidi\u00f3 que resumiera su vida en una frase, dijo: \u201c\u2018Lo intent\u00f3\u2019, Creo que eso ser\u00eda bastante preciso\u201d.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEn enero de 1988, uno de los ingenieros nucleares m\u00e1s veteranos de Taiw\u00e1n desert\u00f3 a Estados Unidos tras pasar informaci\u00f3n crucial sobre un programa ultrasecreto que alterar\u00eda el curso de la historia de Taiw\u00e1n.\n\nEl coronel Chang Hsien-yi fue una figura destacada en el proyecto de armamento nuclear de Taiw\u00e1n, un secreto celosamente guardado entre los a\u00f1os 60 y 80, cuando Taipei se apresuraba a desarrollar su primera bomba nuclear para seguir el ritmo de China.\n\nTambi\u00e9n era informante de la CIA.\n\nChang expuso el programa nuclear secreto de Taiw\u00e1n a Estados Unidos, su aliado m\u00e1s cercano, y le pas\u00f3 informaci\u00f3n que finalmente llev\u00f3 a Estados Unidos a presionar a Taiw\u00e1n para que cerrara el programa, que seg\u00fan los expertos en proliferaci\u00f3n estaba a punto de completarse.\n\nAunque los cr\u00edticos afirman que traicion\u00f3 a su patria y min\u00f3 la capacidad de Taipei para disuadir una posible invasi\u00f3n china, Chang declar\u00f3 a CNN en una rara entrevista que sigue creyendo que tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n correcta.\n\n\u201cNo hay traici\u00f3n en absoluto\u201d, declar\u00f3 a CNN desde su casa de Idaho, donde se instal\u00f3 con su familia.\n\n\u201cDecid\u00ed proporcionar informaci\u00f3n a la CIA porque creo que era bueno para el pueblo de Taiw\u00e1n\u201d, dijo el hombre de 81 a\u00f1os. \u201cS\u00ed, hab\u00eda una lucha pol\u00edtica entre China y Taiw\u00e1n, pero desarrollar cualquier tipo de arma mortal no ten\u00eda sentido para m\u00ed\u201d.\n\nLa historia de Chang guarda similitudes con la de Mordechai Vanunu, el famoso informante israel\u00ed que revel\u00f3 al mundo el programa nuclear clandestino de su pa\u00eds. Pero mientras Vanunu hizo p\u00fablicos los avances de su pa\u00eds, Chang los denunci\u00f3 en secreto y sin ninguna fanfarria.\n\nLas ambiciones nucleares de Taiw\u00e1n\n\nEn 1964, apenas 15 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de que la guerra civil china terminara con una victoria comunista y dejara a los nacionalistas de Chiang Kai-shek controlando \u00fanicamente Taiw\u00e1n, Beijing prob\u00f3 con \u00e9xito un arma nuclear, lo que inquiet\u00f3 profundamente al gobierno de Taipei, que tem\u00eda que alg\u00fan d\u00eda pudiera utilizarse contra la isla.\n\nDos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Chiang lanz\u00f3 un proyecto clandestino para sentar las bases t\u00e9cnicas del desarrollo de armas nucleares durante los siete a\u00f1os siguientes. El Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica Chungshan dirig\u00eda el proyecto bajo el Ministerio de Defensa, y fue all\u00ed donde Chang empez\u00f3 a trabajar como capit\u00e1n del ej\u00e9rcito un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s.\n\nFue elegido para recibir formaci\u00f3n nuclear avanzada, que incluir\u00eda estancias en Estados Unidos. Tras estudiar f\u00edsica y ciencias nucleares en Taiw\u00e1n, asisti\u00f3 al Laboratorio Nacional de Oak Ridge, en Tennessee.\n\nA pesar de las declaraciones oficiales de Taipei de que su investigaci\u00f3n nuclear solo ten\u00eda fines pac\u00edficos, Chang dijo que todos los estudiantes enviados a EE.UU. eran conscientes de su verdadera misi\u00f3n: aprender t\u00e9cnicas para el desarrollo de armas.\n\n\u201cSabemos con precisi\u00f3n, aunque no figure en la declaraci\u00f3n escrita, lo que vamos a hacer, en qu\u00e9 tipo de \u00e1rea debemos concentrarnos\u201d, dijo Chang.\n\n\u201cEst\u00e1bamos algo excitados e intent\u00e1bamos hacer el trabajo\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cTodo lo que hicimos fue centrarnos en el \u00e1rea que nos asignaron, pusimos todo nuestro empe\u00f1o en hacerlo, en aprender todo lo posible\u201d.\n\nMientras estaba en Oak Ridge, record\u00f3 Chang, la CIA ya estaba interesada en \u00e9l.\n\n\u201cEn 1969 o 1970, recuerdo haber recibido una llamada telef\u00f3nica\u201d, dijo. La persona que llam\u00f3 dijo que estaba \u201ccon una empresa y que estaban interesados en el negocio de la energ\u00eda nuclear\u2026 se ofrecieron a llevarme a comer\u201d.\n\n\u201cEn ese momento dije que no ten\u00eda inter\u00e9s porque ten\u00eda una tarea orientada a una misi\u00f3n. Pero no sab\u00eda que era de la CIA, solo lo supe despu\u00e9s de bastantes a\u00f1os\u201d.\n\nChiang Kai-shek lanz\u00f3 por primera vez un proyecto para sentar las bases del desarrollo de armas nucleares en la d\u00e9cada de 1960. Foto de archivo/Getty Images\n\nSospechas de Estados Unidos\n\nEn 1977, un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de doctorarse en ingenier\u00eda nuclear por la Universidad de Tennessee en Knoxville, Chang regres\u00f3 a Taiw\u00e1n. Fue ascendido a teniente coronel y dirigi\u00f3 el desarrollo de c\u00f3digos inform\u00e1ticos para simular explosiones nucleares en el Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda Nuclear (INER), un laboratorio nacional que avanzaba de manera encubierta en el desarrollo de armas.\n\nLos dirigentes taiwaneses se enfrentaban a un delicado equilibrio: Estados Unidos se opon\u00eda firmemente a nuevos programas de armamento nuclear en cualquier parte del mundo, y Taipei no pod\u00eda permitirse alienar a su aliado m\u00e1s importante. Estados Unidos ha confiado durante mucho tiempo en la disuasi\u00f3n nuclear como parte de su estrategia m\u00e1s amplia para contrarrestar el almacenamiento de cabezas nucleares por parte de China. Pero, en virtud de una pol\u00edtica de no proliferaci\u00f3n, se opone a que cualquier pa\u00eds desarrolle nuevas armas nucleares.\n\nPor aquel entonces, Taiw\u00e1n no era la democracia rica y vibrante que es hoy. Era una econom\u00eda en desarrollo bajo el gobierno autocr\u00e1tico del Partido Nacionalista Chino, o Kuomintang. Ese r\u00e9gimen sigui\u00f3 ocupando un puesto en las Naciones Unidas hasta 1971 y mantuvo relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas formales con Estados Unidos hasta 1979.\n\nPara minimizar el riesgo de que se descubrieran sus ambiciones nucleares, la isla solo pretend\u00eda establecer en secreto la capacidad de producir armas nucleares r\u00e1pidamente en cualquier momento, pero no construir un arsenal.\n\n\u201cLas tapaderas de Taiw\u00e1n eran incre\u00edblemente buenas\u201d, afirma David Albright, experto en proliferaci\u00f3n nuclear y autor de \u201cTaiwan\u2019s Former Nuclear Weapons Program: Nuclear Weapons On-Demand\u201d.\n\n\u201cSiempre recalcaron que la investigaci\u00f3n solo ten\u00eda fines civiles\u2026 Los funcionarios (estadounidenses) no sab\u00edan c\u00f3mo romper esta tapadera\u201d.\n\nPero el riesgo de una conflagraci\u00f3n nuclear a trav\u00e9s del estrecho pesaba sobre Chang. El l\u00edder chino Deng Xiaoping, que asumi\u00f3 el poder en 1978, advirti\u00f3 que si Taiw\u00e1n adquir\u00eda armas nucleares, China responder\u00eda con la fuerza.\n\n\u201cCreo que van muy en serio\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 Chang. \u201cYo cre\u00eda en eso\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo quer\u00eda tener ning\u00fan tipo de conflicto con China continental\u201d, dijo. \u201cUtilizar cualquier tipo de armas qu\u00edmicas o nucleares mort\u00edferas\u2026 para m\u00ed no tiene sentido. Creo que todos somos chinos y hacer eso no tiene sentido\u201d.\n\nAs\u00ed que cuando los agentes de la CIA se acercaron de nuevo a Chang durante un viaje a Estados Unidos en 1980, acept\u00f3 hablar.\n\n\u201cDijeron: \u2018Le conocemos y estamos interesados en usted\u2019, y mantuvimos una conversaci\u00f3n\u201d, relat\u00f3 Chang, a\u00f1adiendo que los estadounidenses le sometieron a un detector de mentiras \u201cmuy minucioso\u201d para asegurarse de que no era un agente doble. Ayud\u00f3 a la CIA en algunas tareas puntuales antes de convertirse en informante en 1984.\n\nChang en su antigua casa de Taiw\u00e1n en 1979 con su hija Ann. Cortes\u00eda de Chang Hsien-yi\n\nDurante los cuatro a\u00f1os siguientes, un agente de la CIA, identificado solo como \u201cMark\u201d, se reuni\u00f3 con Chang cada pocos meses en pisos francos de Taipei, incluido un apartamento cerca del mercado nocturno de Shilin, uno de los destinos gastron\u00f3micos m\u00e1s famosos de la isla.\n\nEn esas reuniones, la CIA le ped\u00eda que corroborara informaci\u00f3n de inteligencia, compartiera informaci\u00f3n sobre proyectos recientes del INER y tomara fotos de documentos confidenciales.\n\n\u201cTodas esas conversaciones eran bastante profesionales. Cog\u00eda un l\u00e1piz y un cuaderno para anotar mis respuestas\u201d, cuenta Chang. \u201cMe repet\u00eda que har\u00edan todo lo posible por mantenernos a salvo a m\u00ed y a mi familia\u201d.\n\nEl desastre de Chernobyl en 1986, un catastr\u00f3fico accidente nuclear en Ucrania que expuso a cientos de miles de personas a radiaciones nocivas, solidific\u00f3 la convicci\u00f3n de Chang de que era imperativo detener el programa de armas nucleares de Taiw\u00e1n.\n\nEse mismo a\u00f1o, Vanunu expuso p\u00fablicamente detalles del programa nuclear clandestino de Israel, entregando la informaci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n brit\u00e1nicos y causando una sensaci\u00f3n internacional. Posteriormente fue secuestrado por agentes del Mossad, devuelto a Israel y procesado, y pas\u00f3 a\u00f1os en prisi\u00f3n.\n\nUn nuevo cap\u00edtulo de la vida\n\nLa vida de Chang -y la de su esposa y sus tres hijos- dio un giro dram\u00e1tico en enero de 1988, cuando la CIA los exfiltr\u00f3 a Estados Unidos.\n\nPara entonces, la administraci\u00f3n del presidente Ronald Reagan hab\u00eda reunido pruebas suficientes y aprovech\u00f3 la oportunidad creada por la muerte del presidente Chiang Ching-kuo -hijo de Chiang Kai-shek- para presionar a su sucesor reformista Lee Teng-hui para que cooperara.\n\nAlbright, el experto y escritor, dijo que Chang fue el informante m\u00e1s crucial a la hora de armar a Washington para acabar con el programa taiwan\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cEstados Unidos llevaba a\u00f1os jugando al gato y al rat\u00f3n con Taiw\u00e1n sobre su programa nuclear\u201d, dijo. \u201cChang realmente se asegur\u00f3 de que Estados Unidos tuviera pruebas contundentes que Taiw\u00e1n no pudiera negar\u2026 y (pudiera) enfrentarse directamente a los taiwaneses\u201d.\n\nEn los meses posteriores a la partida de Chang, Estados Unidos envi\u00f3 especialistas para desmantelar una planta de separaci\u00f3n de plutonio, una instalaci\u00f3n dise\u00f1ada para extraer materiales nucleares para la fabricaci\u00f3n de armas. El equipo tambi\u00e9n supervis\u00f3 la retirada de agua pesada, sustancia utilizada como refrigerante en los reactores nucleares, y combustible irradiado, combustible nuclear que puede reprocesarse para extraer materiales para armas nucleares.\n\nChang fue declarado persona buscada en Taiw\u00e1n. La orden de detenci\u00f3n expir\u00f3 en 2000, pero nunca ha regresado a la isla, y declar\u00f3 a CNN que no estaba seguro de c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda recibido. La oficina presidencial y el ministerio de Defensa de Taiw\u00e1n declinaron hacer comentarios cuando CNN se puso en contacto con ellos.\n\n\u00bfH\u00e9roe o traidor?\n\nHasta la fecha, la decisi\u00f3n de Chang de trabajar con la CIA ha seguido siendo controvertida en Taiw\u00e1n, que en los a\u00f1os transcurridos ha continuado su enorme expansi\u00f3n industrial y econ\u00f3mica, convirti\u00e9ndose en una democracia plena en la d\u00e9cada de 1990.\n\nPero las hostilidades entre ambos lados del estrecho persisten. Taipei se ha visto sometido a una creciente presi\u00f3n militar por parte de China, que ahora tiene el mayor ej\u00e9rcito del mundo y se muestra cada vez m\u00e1s firme en sus reivindicaciones territoriales sobre Taiw\u00e1n. El Partido Comunista Chino ha prometido tomar Taiw\u00e1n por la fuerza si es necesario, a pesar de no haberlo controlado nunca.\n\nBeijing deja peque\u00f1o al ej\u00e9rcito de Taiw\u00e1n: gasta unas 13 veces m\u00e1s en defensa. Algunos han argumentado que si Taiw\u00e1n hubiera logrado adquirir armas nucleares podr\u00eda haber servido como elemento disuasorio definitivo, de forma paralela a Ucrania, donde Rusia podr\u00eda no haber invadido si Kyiv hubiera conservado su arsenal nuclear de la era sovi\u00e9tica en lugar de renunciar a \u00e9l.\n\nChang de compras con su esposa en Washington tras su deserci\u00f3n de Taiw\u00e1n. Cortes\u00eda de Chang Hsien-yi\n\nAlgunos taiwaneses han criticado a Chang, diciendo que se extralimit\u00f3 al decidir unilateralmente que la isla est\u00e1 mejor sin una fuerza nuclear disuasoria.\n\n\u201cCreo que es un traidor\u201d, dijo Alexander Huang, profesor asociado de estudios estrat\u00e9gicos en la Universidad de Tamkang, porque las armas \u201cser\u00edan vistas como una herramienta \u00fatil para negociar un mejor resultado diplom\u00e1tico\u201d con Beijing.\n\nPero Su Tzu-yun, director del Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n sobre Defensa y Seguridad Nacional de Taiw\u00e1n, afirm\u00f3 que la falta de una opci\u00f3n nuclear no ha afectado demasiado a las modernas capacidades de defensa de Taiw\u00e1n, porque la munici\u00f3n de precisi\u00f3n puede utilizarse para lograr objetivos similares a los de las armas nucleares t\u00e1cticas.\n\n\u201cEl gobierno taiwan\u00e9s de entonces pensaba que si China desembarcaba en Taiw\u00e1n, podr\u00eda utilizar armas nucleares t\u00e1cticas para eliminar a las tropas que desembarcaran\u201d, dijo. \u201cPero en su ausencia, tambi\u00e9n podemos emplear armas de precisi\u00f3n como misiles para sustituirlas\u201d.\n\nTaiw\u00e1n compra estas armas a Estados Unidos, que -a pesar de haber cerrado el programa nuclear- sigue siendo su socio militar clave, suministr\u00e1ndole munici\u00f3n, entrenamiento y sistemas de defensa.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de armamento, la isla cuenta con lo que algunos consideran un elemento disuasorio m\u00e1s eficaz que las bombas nucleares. En 1987, justo un a\u00f1o antes del cierre del programa nuclear, el empresario tecnol\u00f3gico Morris Chang fund\u00f3 la Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, que hoy produce aproximadamente el 90% de los chips semiconductores m\u00e1s avanzados del mundo para empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas como Apple y Nvidia.\n\nEl papel integral de la isla en la cadena mundial de suministro de semiconductores, seg\u00fan algunos observadores, bastar\u00eda para disuadir a China de lanzar una invasi\u00f3n, formando lo que se conoce como su \u201cEscudo de Silicio\u201d.\n\nAlbright, que realiz\u00f3 una amplia investigaci\u00f3n sobre el programa taiwan\u00e9s, tambi\u00e9n afirm\u00f3 que su \u00e9xito no habr\u00eda sido beneficioso para Taiw\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cCreo que [habr\u00eda] aumentado el riesgo militar de un ataque chino\u201d, dijo, mientras que Washington tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda haber respondido \u201creduciendo su compromiso de seguridad o limitando la ayuda militar\u201d una vez conocidas las capacidades de Taiw\u00e1n.\n\nEn cuanto a Chang Hsien-yi, que se hizo cristiano y disfrutaba jugando al golf al margen de su trabajo a tiempo parcial en una consultora de seguridad nuclear, la decisi\u00f3n que tom\u00f3 hace cuatro d\u00e9cadas fue acertada.\n\n\u201cQuiz\u00e1 sea bueno para el pueblo taiwan\u00e9s. Al menos [no] provocamos a China continental de tal manera que iniciara una guerra agresiva contra Taiw\u00e1n\u201d, dijo Chang.\n\n\u201cLo hice con la conciencia tranquila, no hay traici\u00f3n, al menos a m\u00ed mismo\u201d.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA former US Navy sailor pleaded guilty to a federal charge accusing him of a 2022 plot to attack Naval Station Great Lakes in northern Illinois, according to a plea agreement unsealed Thursday.\n\nXuanyu Harry Pang, 38, allegedly devised a plan involving Iranian actors to conduct an attack against the US to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, a general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who was killed by a US airstrike in 2020, according to court documents. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US in 2019.\n\nIn November, Pang pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to conspiring to and attempting to willfully injure and destroy national defense material, national defense premises, and national defense utilities \u2013 namely Naval Station Great Lakes \u2013 with the intent to injure, interfere with, and obstruct the national defense of the US, the Department of Justice said in a news release Thursday.\n\nPang enlisted in the United States Navy and began his training at Naval Station Great Lakes around February 2022, according to court documents.\n\nPang faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. CNN has reached out to Pang\u2019s attorney for comment.\n\nPang is alleged to have communicated in 2021 with an individual in Colombia about potentially assisting him with his plan, the Department of Justice said.\n\nAccorting to court records, an undercover FBI employee posing as an affiliate of the Iranian armed forces later contacted the person in Colombia about conducting an attack, and the individual put the employee in touch with Pang, who at the time in 2022 was stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes.\n\nPang then shared with the individual in Colombia possible targets for the attack, including Naval Station Great Lakes and other locations in the Chicago area, and the individual in turn shared them with another person working with the FBI who was posing as an associate of the undercover FBI employee, according to court documents.\n\nPang and the individual in Colombia agreed to help the undercover FBI employee and his associates conduct an attack in the US, court records state. They had also exchanged messages in which they discussed demanding a payment of $1 million for their assistance with the plot, according to the documents.\n\nThen, in the fall of 2022, Pang on three occasions met with one of the individuals undercover, the DOJ said.\n\nDuring meetings in Lake Bluff, Illinois \u2013 as the plot coalesced into an attack on the Naval Station \u2013 Pang displayed photos and videos on his phone of multiple locations inside the Naval Station, according to court documents. Pang asked the undercover FBI employee whether he was \u201clooking for max damage,\u201d and the employee said that he was.\n\nAfter being asked by the FBI employee, Pang also agreed to provide two US military uniforms for operatives to wear inside the base during the attack, and a cell phone that could be used as a test for a detonator, court documents say. The FBI employee gave Pang $2,000 in return.\n\nDuring an October meeting, the FBI employee gave Pang $3,000 as payment for Pang and the other individual\u2019s assistance in the operation. Pang sent the individual $1,000 of the $3,000 he had received, according to court documents.\n\nThe FBI Chicago Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating the case, with assistance from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, according to the news release.\n\nPang is detained without bond and is scheduled to be sentenced by a federal district court judge at a later date, according to the news release.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.",

John \"Johnny\" Murphy, who was piloting, and his son, co-pilot Josiah Murphy, were among the three people who were involved in the crash. The single passenger was Cheyenne Murphy, John's daughter.\"Well, you know, this is an act of God. None of us understand his plan,\" John said. \"It's humbling. It's emotional. I'm thankful.\"John and Josiah came back to visit the crash site on Mount Equinox. On Friday, John had a bandage around his left arm, but both he and his son were seen walking and doing OK on Friday. John said that his daughter is also doing well. The family was aiming to land at Rutland, Southern Vermont Regional Airport, for a day of skiing at Killington Resort. The plane took off from Baltimore. However, Murphy said the weather conditions were not what he expected as he approached Rutland.John said They later stalled multiple times and spun out. John said he maneuvered out of the downward spiral before flying into the trees. \"We went right between two trees. It ripped the wings off. We touched down a little bit, kind of heading into the mountain, but we hit some smaller trees that kind of acted like a ramp. We had at least four or five feet of snow up there,\" John said. In those moments before that, the family was not sure if they would survive. \"The grand likelihood was we were going to die,\" Josiah said. John described the relief they all felt after discovering they all lived. \"Once we got out of the plane, you know, we checked ourselves all out, and we, you know, we just cried and hugged each other,\" John said. The family did not have any spinal cord injuries. Rescuers were able to lift John and his kids out of the wreckage on Wednesday. \"Just watching the way those guys worked as a team, the different agencies. No egos, great personalities, I mean, just wonderful people,\" John said. Members of the Federal Aviation Administration were also on the mountain to investigate the crash site on Friday, where they are generating a report that is expected to be released. The family was traveling with their ski equipment, which they recovered on Friday's visit. They said that they are hoping to drive to Killington at a later date.",

                "text": "MIAMI BEACH, FLA. (WSVN) - A prowler who broke into a home in an exclusive Miami Beach neighborhood found himself facing a pistol-toting homeowner, triggering a massive manhunt that led to the burglar\u2019s arrest, police said.\n\nSpeaking with 7News on Thursday, homeowner Babba Joshua Yesharim said he saw the perpetrator on his property on Pine Tree Drive near 43rd Street on surveillance video during the overnight hours.\n\nThen he decided to confront the uninvited guest.\n\n\u201cThe dog was barking. One of the alarms sounded. I checked the cameras. I saw him downstairs on the property. I got my gun, I gave my wife one of our guns,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a bathrobe with a flashlight and handgun, Yesharim faced the home invading burglar.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that was going through my mind at the time was to protect myself and my family at all costs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe security footage captured the pistol-toting homeowner as he greeted the intruder.\n\n\u201cI saw him in my courtyard by my front door. I pulled my gun on him, I told him, \u2018Freeze. I\u2019ve got a gun. I will shoot you,'\u201d said Yesharim. \u201cHe looked at me and he started running away from me. And it looked like he went toward my neighbor\u2019s house and hopped the wall there.\u201d\n\nThe prowler would run into more trouble.\n\n\u201cI also have a house manager on property that was armed as well. He had a shotgun on him,\u201d said Yesharim.\n\nAfter realizing he\u2019d targeted the wrong house, the suspect fled, but his break-in fail was about to get worse.\n\nThe search to find the burglar led to a massive manhunt, one made up of everything from SWAT teams to K-9 units to a police chopper.\n\n\u201cThe police were really quick to respond,\u201d said Yesharim. \u201cI was really impressed with that. They were at my house in maybe three minutes.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen Miami Beach Police units flooded the Mid-Beach block.\n\nWith help from a Miami-Dade Sheriff\u2019s Office helicopter, officers also put their police boat to work just east of the search mission.\n\nBut officers would find their man on land. K-9s and SWAT team officials grabbed him at a nearby vacant lot on Pine Tree.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jose Santospena, was caught and cuffed and headed to jail.\n\nSantospena is only accused of stealing from the victimized family\u2019s fridge.\n\n\u201cHe took a few of my kids\u2019 yogurts, from all we can find. We can\u2019t really find anything else,\u201d said Yesharim. \u201cHe cold have taken, or tried to take, I should say, a lot more. I don\u2019t know. I assume he wasn\u2019t there for just yogurts.\u201d\n\nThe homeowner said he is grateful no shots were fired.\n\n\u201cThank God nobody was hurt, and they apprehended the guy,\u201d he said.\n\nSantospena was charged with occupied burglary. He remains behind bars at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in West Miami-Dade and is expected to appear on Friday.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

But when her water bill arrived, she was stunned by what she saw.\n\n\"My normal bill, historically, was $200 to $300 a quarter, and this was $20,000,\" she said.\n\nThe widowed grandmother says that, out of nowhere, the amount she owed jumped tenfold, and she was back-billed at the elevated rate for two prior years.\n\nThe New York City Department of Environmental Protection denied her two appeals and upheld the charges.\n\nThe DEP told CBS News New York, \"Technicians have visited the property several times to confirm all equipment is working properly - which leads us to believe there has been a significant water leak within the home. Property owners are responsible for fixing water leaks and may be eligible for financial forgiveness if the leak is fixed promptly.\"\n\nMcGowan says she knows of no such leak, and she says her bills lowered again after the DEP conducted a water meter replacement. The DEP declined to address how the rate stabilized.\n\nNew York state senator believes DEP is at fault\n\n\"This is a classic case of government gone awry,\" New York State Senator John Liu said.\n\nHe believes the DEP is at fault and withholding key information.\n\n\"The DEP is claiming that this woman used enough water to fill 10 swimming pools every single month for two years. It's just inexplicable,\" he said. \"We're now demanding that DEP fix this issue and stop harassing her with these ridiculous bills.\"\n\nLiving on a fixed income, McGowan can't afford to pay.\n\n\"Right now, they still keep sending me notices that they're going to put a lien on the house if I don't pay the bill,\" she said.\n\nAs monthly interest mounts, she longs for peace of mind.\n\n\"I think about this all the time,\" she said.\n\nYou can email Elle with Queens story ideas by CLICKING HERE.",

Oremos por la atormentada Ucrania, Palestina, Israel, L\u00edbano, Myanmar, Sud\u00e1n y Kivu\u201d.\n\nTambi\u00e9n describi\u00f3 su fragilidad como una bendici\u00f3n y su enfermedad como una \u201coportunidad para compartir en cuerpo y esp\u00edritu la condici\u00f3n de tantas personas enfermas y en sufrimiento\u201d.\n\nLa estancia hospitalaria m\u00e1s larga desde que se convirti\u00f3 en papa\n\nEl papa Francisco estaba de buen humor este s\u00e1bado, y pudo moverse y caminar \u2014a veces con asistencia\u2014 y puede comer alimentos s\u00f3lidos, seg\u00fan las fuentes del Vaticano un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s del episodio respiratorio.\n\nFrancisco fue ingresado por primera vez en el Hospital Gemelli de Roma hace m\u00e1s de dos semanas, despu\u00e9s de ser afectado por una serie de problemas m\u00e9dicos relacionados con los pulmones, incluyendo bronquitis y luego neumon\u00eda. Su hospitalizaci\u00f3n actual es su cuarta, y ahora la m\u00e1s larga, desde que se convirti\u00f3 en papa en 2013.\n\nEl pont\u00edfice ha sufrido problemas relacionados con los pulmones durante gran parte de su vida. De joven, sufri\u00f3 una neumon\u00eda severa y le extirparon parte de un pulm\u00f3n.\n\nEl Vaticano ha estado publicando actualizaciones dos veces al d\u00eda sobre la salud del papa.\n\nLa agenda del l\u00edder argentino ha sido despejada para acomodar su tratamiento m\u00e9dico intensivo.\n\nNo se espera que el papa dirija la oraci\u00f3n del \u00c1ngelus este domingo, por tercera semana consecutiva.\n\nTampoco dirigir\u00e1 el servicio del Mi\u00e9rcoles de Ceniza la pr\u00f3xima semana, marcando el inicio de la Cuaresma, por solo la segunda vez en sus 12 a\u00f1os de papado, seg\u00fan el Vaticano. Se espera que un cardenal dirija el servicio en su lugar.\n\nEl viernes por la noche, mientras rezaba por el papa, el cardenal argentino V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez dijo: \u201cCiertamente est\u00e1 cerca del coraz\u00f3n del Santo Padre que nuestras oraciones no sean solo por \u00e9l, sino tambi\u00e9n por todos aquellos que, en este momento particular dram\u00e1tico y de sufrimiento del mundo, llevan la pesada carga de la guerra, la enfermedad y la pobreza\u201d.\n\nEsta historia se actualiz\u00f3",

                "text": "Londres CNN \u2014\n\nUn t\u00edmido deshielo en las g\u00e9lidas relaciones entre Estados Unidos y Rusia est\u00e1 allanando el camino para que las empresas estadounidenses hagan lo que hasta hace poco parec\u00eda impensable: regresar al pa\u00eds tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de haberlo abandonado en masa.\n\nTras unas conversaciones trascendentales con funcionarios rusos la semana pasada, el secretario de Estado de EE.UU., Marco Rubio, ensalz\u00f3 las \u201cextraordinarias oportunidades\u201d, econ\u00f3micas y geopol\u00edticas, que tanto Estados Unidos como Rusia podr\u00edan aprovechar una vez finalizada la guerra en Ucrania. Y el lunes, el presidente Donald Trump dijo que estaba \u201cintentando cerrar algunos acuerdos de desarrollo econ\u00f3mico\u201d con Mosc\u00fa.\n\nPero la escala del \u00e9xodo corporativo de Rusia despu\u00e9s de que invadiera Ucrania en 2022 podr\u00eda dificultar ese proyecto, con pocas empresas estadounidenses que queden en el pa\u00eds para cerrar cualquier acuerdo. M\u00e1s de 1.000 empresas internacionales han abandonado voluntariamente o reducido sus operaciones en Rusia desde entonces, seg\u00fan una lista recopilada por la Escuela de Administraci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Yale.\n\nKirill Dmitriev, director del Fondo Ruso de Inversi\u00f3n Directa, declar\u00f3 que espera que algunas empresas estadounidenses regresen tan pronto como en el segundo trimestre, seg\u00fan comentarios citados por la agencia estatal rusa TASS la semana pasada.\n\nSin embargo, analistas se muestran dubitativos, argumentando que la recompensa por reinvertir en Rusia ser\u00eda demasiado peque\u00f1a para que las empresas justificaran los potenciales costos de hacerlo.\n\n\u201cSoy esc\u00e9ptico en cuanto a que muchas empresas arriesgar\u00edan su reputaci\u00f3n y se arriesgar\u00edan a entrar en este entorno empresarial tan inseguro y arriesgado para este mercado relativamente peque\u00f1o\u201d, declar\u00f3 Janis Kluge, investigadora del Instituto Alem\u00e1n de Asuntos Internacionales y de Seguridad, o SWP.\n\n\u201cSigue siendo demasiado t\u00f3xico para que las empresas estadounidenses ganen mucho dinero all\u00ed\u201d, declar\u00f3 a CNN.\n\nUn entorno \u201cinsostenible\u201d\n\nRusia ha sido durante mucho tiempo un lugar dif\u00edcil para hacer negocios.\n\n\u201cAntes hab\u00eda problemas constantes en t\u00e9rminos de corrupci\u00f3n, burocracia, tr\u00e1mites burocr\u00e1ticos (y) el trato con el Kremlin\u201d, dijo Timothy Ash, especialista en Rusia de Chatham House, un think tank con sede en Londres, y estratega senior de RBC Bluebay Asset Management.\n\nPero desde la invasi\u00f3n \u2014y la bater\u00eda de sanciones econ\u00f3micas impuestas por Occidente a Rusia\u2014 el pa\u00eds se ha convertido en un lugar a\u00fan m\u00e1s complicado para las empresas. Probablemente, el mayor riesgo al que se enfrentan ahora las empresas extranjeras es la posibilidad de que el Kremlin confisque sus activos.\n\nEn 2023, el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, firm\u00f3 un decreto que permit\u00eda al Gobierno poner bajo su control temporal los activos extranjeros en el pa\u00eds. Meses despu\u00e9s, el Kremlin nacionaliz\u00f3 los activos locales del fabricante franc\u00e9s de yogures Danone y de la cervecera danesa Carlsberg.\n\nLa corrupci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n ha empeorado desde niveles ya elevados. En 2021, la organizaci\u00f3n sin \u00e1nimo de lucro Transparencia Internacional situ\u00f3 a Rusia en el puesto 136, empatada con Liberia, en su clasificaci\u00f3n de 180 pa\u00edses y territorios por sus niveles percibidos de corrupci\u00f3n en el sector p\u00fablico. En 2024, Rusia hab\u00eda descendido a\u00fan m\u00e1s en el \u00cdndice de Percepci\u00f3n de la Corrupci\u00f3n hasta el puesto 154, empatada con Azerbaiy\u00e1n, Honduras y el L\u00edbano.\n\nMientras tanto, la econom\u00eda rusa se ha integrado menos en el resto del mundo, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Kluge en el SWP, debido, en gran parte, a las sanciones.\n\nEn concreto, poco despu\u00e9s de la invasi\u00f3n, Estados Unidos, la Uni\u00f3n Europea, el Reino Unido y Canad\u00e1 prohibieron conjuntamente a algunos bancos rusos el acceso al servicio de mensajer\u00eda SWIFT, una red de alta seguridad que conecta a miles de instituciones financieras de todo el mundo. Esto ha hecho mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil para esos bancos enviar y recibir dinero del extranjero.\n\nEstados Unidos no podr\u00eda readmitir en la red a los bancos vetados sin la cooperaci\u00f3n de la UE, ya que SWIFT tiene su sede en B\u00e9lgica, a\u00f1adi\u00f3 Kluge.\n\nDel mismo modo, aunque Estados Unidos levante su amplio conjunto de controles a la exportaci\u00f3n y congelaci\u00f3n de activos impuestos a Rusia desde febrero de 2022, sus principales socios comerciales no revocar\u00e1n necesariamente sus propias medidas contra Mosc\u00fa. El lunes, la Uni\u00f3n Europea aprob\u00f3 su decimosexta tanda de sanciones contra Rusia.\n\n\u201cSe ha vuelto muy caro y engorroso hacer incluso una transacci\u00f3n en monedas occidentales desde (dentro de) Rusia\u201d, dijo Kluge, se\u00f1alando que las sanciones hab\u00edan \u201checho que continuar con los negocios en Rusia fuera insostenible para muchas empresas occidentales\u201d.\n\nUna \u00e9poca del pasado\n\nRusia ya no es un \u201clugar obvio para hacer dinero\u201d para las empresas extranjeras, seg\u00fan Elina Ribakova, investigadora principal del Instituto Peterson de Econom\u00eda Internacional, con sede en Washington. Y no ha sido as\u00ed desde hace una d\u00e9cada, declar\u00f3 a CNN.\n\nEl apogeo de la econom\u00eda rusa \u2014que Ribakova sit\u00faa entre principios de la d\u00e9cada de 2000 y alrededor de 2014\u2014 coincidi\u00f3 con el auge de los precios del petr\u00f3leo. Mosc\u00fa se benefici\u00f3 de la exportaci\u00f3n de grandes cantidades de petr\u00f3leo y gas natural al resto del mundo, incluido Estados Unidos. Una proporci\u00f3n considerable de las empresas extranjeras que se establecieron en Rusia eran productoras de energ\u00eda, as\u00ed como minoristas que esperaban vender sus productos a la floreciente clase media del pa\u00eds, explic\u00f3.\n\nAhora, \u201clos papeles han cambiado radicalmente\u201d, puesto que Estados Unidos ya no necesita los recursos naturales de Rusia.\n\nUna planta de tratamiento de petr\u00f3leo en el campo petrol\u00edfero de Yarakta, en la regi\u00f3n de Irkutsk, Rusia, en marzo de 2019. Vasily Fedosenko/Reuters/Archivo\n\nEn la actualidad, Estados Unidos no solo produce mucho m\u00e1s petr\u00f3leo y gas natural que en d\u00e9cadas anteriores, sino que tambi\u00e9n exporta estos combustibles, compitiendo as\u00ed directamente con Rusia en el mercado mundial de la energ\u00eda.\n\nPor ejemplo, Europa ha aumentado sus importaciones de gas natural licuado estadounidense \u2014una forma refrigerada de gas natural que puede transportarse en buques cisterna transoce\u00e1nicos\u2014 para sustituir los suministros tradicionalmente importados de Rusia.\n\nLa guerra tambi\u00e9n ha reducido la clase media rusa, afirm\u00f3 Ribakova. Muchas personas est\u00e1n luchando o han muerto en los campos de batalla de Ucrania, o abandonaron el pa\u00eds al comienzo de la invasi\u00f3n, aunque los salarios han crecido debido a la grave escasez de mano de obra.\n\nToda la econom\u00eda est\u00e1 ahora impulsada por el complejo militar e industrial, dijo Ribakova. Y ese es un sector en el que es poco probable que Estados Unidos y Rusia encuentren una \u201ccooperaci\u00f3n natural\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3.\n\nEl riesgo no vale la pena\n\nPara las empresas extranjeras, volver a Rusia no valdr\u00eda la pena.\n\nUn importante dolor de cabeza para las empresas que regresan ser\u00eda la probable fragilidad de cualquier distensi\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica entre Mosc\u00fa y Washington, dijeron analistas a CNN.\n\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 ocurre si la actitud rusa (hacia Estados Unidos) cambia?\u201d, dijo Ribakova. \u201cPuede que hoy le pongan la alfombra roja. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana? Es muy impredecible\u201d.\n\nLa incertidumbre funcionar\u00eda en ambos sentidos, argument\u00f3 Michael Rochlitz, profesor asociado en las econom\u00edas de Rusia, Europa del Este y Eurasia en la Universidad de Oxford.\n\n\u201cCon la administraci\u00f3n Trump, cada d\u00eda, cada semana, (cambia) mucho. As\u00ed que, \u00bfrealmente quieres hacer inversiones basadas en estas pol\u00edticas err\u00e1ticas?\u201d, dijo. \u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasar\u00e1 dentro de cuatro a\u00f1os si hay un presidente dem\u00f3crata?\u201d\n\nRochlitz resume sin rodeos la situaci\u00f3n que espera a las empresas que regresen a Rusia: \u201cAlto riesgo, baja rentabilidad\u201d.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEl Blue Ghost, una nave espacial sin tripulaci\u00f3n desarrollada en Estados Unidos, lleg\u00f3 a la superficie de la Luna con \u00e9xito, convirtiendo a Firefly Aerospace, con sede en Texas, en la segunda empresa del sector privado que logra semejante haza\u00f1a.\n\nEl alunizador, de 2 metros de altura, aterriz\u00f3 en la cara oculta de la Luna a las 3:34 a.m. de este domingo, hora de Miami.\n\nEste a\u00f1o se ha lanzado un desfile de m\u00f3dulos de aterrizaje lunar desarrollados por el sector privado, parte de un convoy de naves espaciales rob\u00f3ticas que la NASA y sus agencias asociadas esperan que allane el camino para que los astronautas regresen a la superficie lunar a finales de esta d\u00e9cada.\n\nEl \u00e9xito no estaba ni mucho menos garantizado. En febrero de 2023, otra empresa espacial con sede en Texas, Intuitive Machines, se convirti\u00f3 en la primera empresa del sector privado en aterrizar con suavidad un veh\u00edculo en la Luna, pero, en t\u00e9rminos generales, aproximadamente la mitad de todos los intentos de alunizaje han acabado en fracaso.\n\nLa misi\u00f3n Blue Ghost aterriz\u00f3 cerca de un antiguo volc\u00e1n llamado Mons Latreille, situado en el extremo oriental de la cara visible de la Luna, justo al norte del ecuador.\n\nMons Latreille se encuentra en el Mare Crisium, una extensa cuenca lunar de 550 kil\u00f3metros de ancho. Los cient\u00edficos creen que Mare Crisium, o \u00abMar de las Crisis\u00bb en lat\u00edn, se form\u00f3 cuando la Luna fue golpeada por un asteroide. Con el tiempo, la cuenca se inund\u00f3 de lava bas\u00e1ltica, una lava oscura com\u00fan en la Tierra.\n\nEl equipo eligi\u00f3 este lugar porque \u201cevita grandes anomal\u00edas magn\u00e9ticas (o interrupciones) en la superficie lunar que podr\u00edan perturbar algunas de las mediciones de nuestra carga \u00fatil\u201d, explic\u00f3 Ryan Watkins, cient\u00edfico del programa de la Oficina de Estrategia e Integraci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica de Exploraci\u00f3n de la NASA, durante una sesi\u00f3n informativa celebrada en diciembre.\n\nLa misi\u00f3n de Blue Ghost en la luna\n\nEl Blue Ghost viaj\u00f3 equipado con 10 instrumentos cient\u00edficos y demostraciones tecnol\u00f3gicas de la NASA, algunos de los cuales ya empezaron a recoger datos, mientras el m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje lunar atravesaba el vac\u00edo de aproximadamente 384.400 kil\u00f3metros que separa la Tierra de la Luna.\n\nEl equipo incluye un dispositivo que est\u00e1 probando c\u00f3mo podr\u00edan utilizarse los servicios GPS en \u00f3rbita y en la superficie lunar, un aspirador para el suelo y un telescopio que observar\u00e1 c\u00f3mo responde el campo magn\u00e9tico protector de la Tierra, tambi\u00e9n conocido como magnetosfera, a la meteorolog\u00eda espacial.\n\nFirefly tambi\u00e9n espera que la nave proporcione im\u00e1genes asombrosas desde su lugar de aterrizaje.\n\nDurante sus 14 d\u00edas de operaciones en la Luna, el Blue Ghost fotografiar\u00e1 un eclipse, durante el cual la Tierra bloquear\u00e1 los rayos solares a la superficie lunar durante unas cinco horas. Tambi\u00e9n se espera que el veh\u00edculo tome im\u00e1genes de un fen\u00f3meno del que los astronautas fueron testigos por \u00faltima vez hace m\u00e1s de 50 a\u00f1os.\n\n\u201cHay un fen\u00f3meno llamado el resplandor del horizonte lunar (luz dispersa causada por part\u00edculas electrost\u00e1ticas flotantes) que s\u00f3lo los astronautas del Apolo 15 y 17 han visto con sus ojos\u201d, dijo Jason Kim, CEO de Firefly, a CNN en una entrevista anterior. \u201cVamos a ser capaces de capturar eso en video de alta definici\u00f3n 4K por 4K y compartirlo con el resto del mundo\u201d.\n\nEl Blue Ghost de Firefly tambi\u00e9n continuar\u00e1 recopilando datos durante varias horas en la noche lunar, cuando las condiciones brutalmente fr\u00edas empujen la zona de aterrizaje cerca de Mons Latreille a la sombra y las temperaturas puedan descender hasta los 173 grados Celsius bajo cero.\n\nLa ca\u00edda de la noche lunar suele suponer el fin de los m\u00f3dulos de alunizaje. Pero la NASA quiere que Blue Ghost lo intente. La agencia espacial incluso aument\u00f3 el valor del contrato que est\u00e1 pagando a Firefly - de US$ 93 millones a US$ 101 millones - en parte para que la empresa pudiera preparar el m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje que sobreviviera a las temperaturas tan fr\u00edas, dijo Kim.\n\nEl m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje Blue Ghost forma parte de la iniciativa CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) de la NASA.\n\nActualmente hay 14 empresas que pueden optar a los contratos CLPS, que proporcionan dinero para realizar alunizajes. Hasta ahora, dos empresas - Astrobotic Technology e Intuitive Machines - han intentado misiones, pero s\u00f3lo la \u00faltima ha conseguido un aterrizaje suave.\n\nLa primera misi\u00f3n de Astrobotic, el a\u00f1o pasado, fracas\u00f3 poco despu\u00e9s de alcanzar la \u00f3rbita por problemas de propulsi\u00f3n. Y aunque la misi\u00f3n de Intuitive Machines fue un \u00e9xito, su m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje se volc\u00f3 sobre un costado, lo que limit\u00f3 el tiempo que pudo funcionar.\n\nOtros dos veh\u00edculos del sector privado se encuentran en tr\u00e1nsito hacia la Luna prepar\u00e1ndose para realizar sus propias aproximaciones. El segundo m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje de Intuitive Machines despeg\u00f3 el mi\u00e9rcoles y se dirige a la regi\u00f3n del polo sur de la Luna. Y un m\u00f3dulo de aterrizaje construido por la empresa japonesa Ispace, que se lanz\u00f3 junto con Blue Ghost en enero, intentar\u00e1 un alunizaje suave esta primavera, en un esfuerzo por redimir el primer intento fallido de la empresa en 2023.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nUn pez bajo un tejado. Una figura de palo sin cabeza. Una serie de l\u00edneas que parecen un rastrillo de jard\u00edn.\n\nEstos s\u00edmbolos forman parte de una escritura totalmente indescifrable de una sofisticada civilizaci\u00f3n antigua de miles de a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad. Y siguen siendo un misterio perdurable que ha suscitado acalorados debates, amenazas de muerte a investigadores y premios en met\u00e1lico por la codiciada respuesta.\n\nEl \u00faltimo de estos premios lo ofreci\u00f3 el mes pasado el ministro principal de un estado indio: un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares a quien pueda descifrar la escritura de la civilizaci\u00f3n del Valle del Indo, que se extend\u00eda por lo que hoy es Pakist\u00e1n y el norte de la India.\n\nRajesh P. N. Rao, profesor de inform\u00e1tica de la Universidad de Washington que lleva m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada trabajando en la escritura, afirma: \u201cSi logramos descifrarla por completo, podremos resolver una cuesti\u00f3n realmente importante sobre la prehistoria del sur de Asia\u201d.\n\nSi se descifra, la escritura podr\u00eda ofrecer una visi\u00f3n de una civilizaci\u00f3n de la Edad de Bronce que se cree que rivalizaba con el antiguo Egipto y Mesopotamia. Algunos creen que este vasto dominio alberg\u00f3 a millones de personas, con ciudades que presum\u00edan de una planificaci\u00f3n urbana avanzada, pesos y medidas estandarizados y extensas rutas comerciales.\n\nMuchos sellos ten\u00edan este motivo com\u00fan, a menudo descrito como un unicornio, aunque otros sostienen que era un toro.

DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini Editorial/Getty Images\n\nY lo que quiz\u00e1 sea m\u00e1s importante, podr\u00eda ayudar a responder preguntas fundamentales sobre qui\u00e9nes eran los habitantes del valle del Indo y sus descendientes, un debate pol\u00edticamente tenso sobre las controvertidas ra\u00edces de la India moderna y sus habitantes aut\u00f3ctonos.\n\n\u201cCualquiera que sea el grupo que reivindique esa civilizaci\u00f3n, podr\u00e1 afirmar que fue uno de los primeros en tener una planificaci\u00f3n urbana y un comercio asombroso, y que navegaba por los mares para comerciar a escala mundial\u201d, explica Rao.\n\n\u201cTiene mucho cach\u00e9 si puedes afirmar que: \u2018Era nuestra gente que hac\u00eda eso\u2019\u201d.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es tan dif\u00edcil de descifrar?\n\nAunque la escritura sigue sin resolverse desde que se publicaron sus primeras muestras en 1875, s\u00ed sabemos algo sobre la cultura del Valle del Indo en s\u00ed, gracias a las excavaciones arqueol\u00f3gicas de grandes ciudades como Mohenjo-daro, situada en la actual provincia pakistan\u00ed de Sindh, a unos 510 kil\u00f3metros al noreste de Karachi.\n\nEstas ciudades se dise\u00f1aron siguiendo un sistema de cuadr\u00edcula como el de Nueva York o Barcelona, y estaban equipadas con sistemas de drenaje y gesti\u00f3n del agua, caracter\u00edsticas que en aquel momento \u201cno ten\u00edan parang\u00f3n en la historia\u201d, seg\u00fan un art\u00edculo.\n\nA lo largo del segundo y tercer milenios a.C., los mercaderes del Indo comerciaban con pueblos del golfo P\u00e9rsico y Medio Oriente, y sus barcos tra\u00edan lingotes de cobre, perlas, especias y marfil. Fabricaban joyas de oro y plata y constru\u00edan asentamientos y colonias lejanas.\n\nFinalmente, hacia 1800 a.C. -m\u00e1s de 1.000 a\u00f1os antes del nacimiento de la antigua Roma- la civilizaci\u00f3n se derrumb\u00f3 y la gente emigr\u00f3 a aldeas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as. Algunos creen que el cambio en el clima fue el factor determinante, con pruebas de largas sequ\u00edas, cambios de temperatura y precipitaciones impredecibles que podr\u00edan haber da\u00f1ado la agricultura en esos \u00faltimos siglos.\n\nEsta ilustraci\u00f3n muestra el interior reconstruido de un edificio residencial de Mohenjo-daro, en la civilizaci\u00f3n del Indo. Dea Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images\n\nPero lo que sabemos de la civilizaci\u00f3n del Indo es limitado en comparaci\u00f3n con la riqueza de la informaci\u00f3n disponible sobre sus contempor\u00e1neas, como el antiguo Egipto, Mesopotamia y los mayas. Esto se debe en gran parte a la escritura indescifrable, que se encontr\u00f3 en artefactos como cer\u00e1mica y sellos de piedra.\n\nHay varias razones por las que ha sido tan dif\u00edcil de descifrar. En primer lugar, no hay tantos artefactos para analizar: los arque\u00f3logos solo han encontrado unas 4.000 inscripciones, frente a los 5 millones de palabras que se calcula que tiene el antiguo egipcio, que incluye jerogl\u00edficos y otras variantes.\n\nMuchas de esas reliquias del Indo son muy peque\u00f1as, a menudo sellos de piedra que miden una pulgada cuadrada, lo que significa que su escritura es corta y la mayor\u00eda de las secuencias contienen solo cuatro o cinco s\u00edmbolos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, y esto es crucial, a\u00fan no existe un artefacto biling\u00fce que contenga la escritura del Valle del Indo y su traducci\u00f3n a otro idioma, como la Piedra Rosetta para el egipcio y el griego antiguos. Tampoco tenemos pistas, como los nombres de gobernantes reconocidos del Indo, que puedan ayudar a descifrar la escritura, del mismo modo que los nombres de Cleopatra y Ptolomeo ayudaron a descifrar el egipcio antiguo.\n\nHay algunas cosas en las que los expertos est\u00e1n de acuerdo. La mayor\u00eda cree que se escrib\u00eda de derecha a izquierda, y muchos especulan que se utilizaba con fines religiosos y econ\u00f3micos, como por ejemplo para marcar art\u00edculos para el comercio. Incluso hay algunas interpretaciones de los signos en las que coinciden varios expertos: por ejemplo, una figura de palo sin cabeza que representa a una persona.\n\nSin embargo, hasta que no se encuentre un equivalente a la Piedra Rosetta, estas teor\u00edas seguir\u00e1n sin demostrarse. \u201cNo se ha alcanzado la unanimidad ni siquiera en las cuestiones b\u00e1sicas\u201d, escribieron los expertos en el Indo Jagat Pati Joshi y Asko Parpola en un libro de 1987 que catalogaba cientos de sellos e inscripciones.\n\nIncluso d\u00e9cadas despu\u00e9s, \u201ca\u00fan no se ha descifrado ni un solo signo\u201d, afirma Nisha Yadav, investigadora del Instituto Tata de Investigaci\u00f3n Fundamental de Bombay, que trabaj\u00f3 con Rao en el proyecto y lleva casi 20 a\u00f1os estudiando la escritura.\n\nEl Gran Ba\u00f1o, una de las estructuras m\u00e1s conocidas del yacimiento arqueol\u00f3gico de Mohenjo-Daro. Ivar Sigurdson/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nTeor\u00edas controversiales\n\nPara algunos, resolver la escritura no es solo curiosidad intelectual o estudio acad\u00e9mico: es una cuesti\u00f3n existencial de alto riesgo.\n\nPorque creen que podr\u00eda zanjar la pol\u00e9mica sobre qui\u00e9nes eran exactamente los pueblos del Indo y en qu\u00e9 direcci\u00f3n fluy\u00f3 la migraci\u00f3n, dentro o fuera de la India.\n\nHay dos grupos principales que luchan por reivindicar la civilizaci\u00f3n del Indo. Un grupo sostiene que la escritura est\u00e1 vinculada a lenguas indoeuropeas como el s\u00e1nscrito antiguo, que dio origen a muchas lenguas habladas actualmente en el norte de la India.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los estudiosos creen que los emigrantes arios de Asia Central trajeron las lenguas indoeuropeas a la India. Pero este grupo sostiene que fue al rev\u00e9s: que el s\u00e1nscrito y sus parientes se originaron en la civilizaci\u00f3n del Valle del Indo y se extendieron hacia Europa, dijo Rao.\n\nDescribi\u00f3 su afirmaci\u00f3n como: \u201cPara empezar, todo estaba en la India\u2026 Nada vino de fuera\u201d.\n\nHay un segundo grupo que cree que la escritura est\u00e1 vinculada a la familia de lenguas drav\u00eddicas que hoy se hablan mayoritariamente en el sur de la India, lo que sugiere que las lenguas drav\u00eddicas fueron las primeras que se hablaron en la regi\u00f3n antes de ser expulsadas por la llegada de los arios al norte.\n\nM. K. Stalin, el l\u00edder del estado sure\u00f1o de Tamil Nadu que ofreci\u00f3 el premio de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, se encuentra entre los que creen que la lengua del Indo era un antepasado dravidiano, teor\u00eda que Rao describi\u00f3 como la m\u00e1s \u201ctradicional\u201d, aunque hay estudiosos respetados en ambos bandos.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay quien, como el experto en el Indo Iravatham Mahadevan, sostiene que el debate no tiene sentido, ya que la distinci\u00f3n entre arios del norte y dravidianos del sur no est\u00e1 clara.\n\n\u201cNo hay pueblos drav\u00eddicos ni arios, al igual que los pakistan\u00edes y los indios son racialmente muy similares\u201d, declar\u00f3 en una entrevista en 1998.\n\n\u201cAmbos somos producto de un largu\u00edsimo periodo de matrimonios mixtos, ha habido migraciones\u2026 Ahora no se puede segregar racialmente a ning\u00fan elemento de la poblaci\u00f3n india\u201d.\n\nAun as\u00ed, la cuesti\u00f3n es delicada. En una charla TED de 2011, Rao afirm\u00f3 haber recibido cartas de odio tras publicar algunos de sus hallazgos. Otros investigadores han descrito haber recibido amenazas de muerte, como Steve Farmer, quien, junto con sus colegas, sorprendi\u00f3 al mundo acad\u00e9mico en 2004 al argumentar que la escritura del Indo no representa una lengua en absoluto, sino que es simplemente un conjunto de s\u00edmbolos como los que ver\u00edamos en las se\u00f1ales de tr\u00e1fico modernas.\n\nC\u00f3mo est\u00e1n tratando de descrifrar el c\u00f3digo\n\nA pesar de estas tensiones, la escritura ha apasionado durante mucho tiempo a investigadores y aficionados, y algunos han dedicado sus carreras al enigma.\n\nAlgunos, como Parpola -uno de los eminentes expertos en la materia-, han intentado descifrar el significado de ciertos signos. Por ejemplo, sugiere, en muchas lenguas drav\u00eddicas las palabras \u201cpez\u201d y \u201cestrella\u201d suenan igual, y las estrellas se utilizaban a menudo para simbolizar deidades en otras escrituras antiguas, por lo que los s\u00edmbolos del Indo que parecen peces podr\u00edan representar dioses.\n\nOtros investigadores, como Rao y Yadav, se centran m\u00e1s en encontrar patrones dentro de la escritura. Para ello, entrenan modelos inform\u00e1ticos que analizan una cadena de signos y, a continuaci\u00f3n, eliminan ciertos signos hasta que el ordenador puede adivinar con precisi\u00f3n cu\u00e1les son los s\u00edmbolos que faltan.\n\nEsto es \u00fatil por varias razones: podemos comprender mejor los patrones de funcionamiento de la escritura -por ejemplo, la letra \u201cQ\u201d suele ir seguida de la \u201cU\u201d en ingl\u00e9s- y puede ayudar a los investigadores a rellenar los huecos de los artefactos con signos da\u00f1ados o ausentes.\n\nConocer estos patrones comunes puede ayudar a identificar secuencias que no siguen las reglas. Yadav se refiri\u00f3 a sellos hallados en Asia Occidental, lejos del valle del Indo, que, aunque utilizaban los mismos signos del Indo, segu\u00edan patrones totalmente distintos, lo que sugiere que la escritura pudo evolucionar para utilizarse en distintas lenguas, de forma similar al alfabeto latino.\n\nTambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n los aficionados al rompecabezas que quieren intentar resolverlo. Con el anuncio del premio de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares -aunque sin informaci\u00f3n clara sobre d\u00f3nde se puede solicitar-, los aficionados han acudido en masa a los expertos para compartir ansiosamente sus teor\u00edas.\n\n\u201cAntes recib\u00eda uno o dos correos electr\u00f3nicos a la semana. Pero ahora, tras el anuncio del premio, recibo casi todos los d\u00edas\u201d, explica Rao. Proceden de todo tipo de personas de todo el mundo, escriben en distintos idiomas e incluso hay familias que trabajan juntas en el rompecabezas.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de tantos a\u00f1os, Rao oscila entre el optimismo y la resignaci\u00f3n. Cualquier nuevo avance requerir\u00eda un trabajo de equipo multidisciplinar internacional, una financiaci\u00f3n enorme e incluso negociaciones pol\u00edticas para permitir excavaciones en zonas fronterizas disputadas por India y Pakist\u00e1n, afirma.\n\nPero en los d\u00edas buenos, mantiene la esperanza. Lo mismo le ocurre a Yadav, fascinado por la civilizaci\u00f3n del Valle del Indo desde que la conoci\u00f3 en cuarto curso. Incluso sin la promesa de una soluci\u00f3n, la belleza de la tarea la atrae a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o.\n\n\u201cEstoy deseando trabajar en el problema todos los d\u00edas\u201d, afirma. \u201cSi desciframos la escritura, abriremos una ventana a la vida y la ideolog\u00eda de los pueblos del Indo. Llegaremos a saber muchas cosas sobre nuestros antepasados\u2026 qu\u00e9 pensaban, en qu\u00e9 se centraban\u201d.\n\nEstos detalles \u201cse nos ocultan hoy en d\u00eda\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cEso me mantiene m\u00e1s pegado al problema que cualquier otra cosa\u201d.\n\nAishwarya S Iyer de CNN contribuy\u00f3 a este reporte.",

Some criticize the game, while others say it's sports.\n\n\"You know there are plenty of people who would've just given up, and none of our kids did, and that's a testament to Belle Tire and our coaches,\" said Lonnie Scott, parent of a Belle Tire player. \"It was all 16-minute periods, there was no running clock, it wasn't any faster than that, and there was no mercy rule.

Landyn has played hockey for nearly a decade.\n\nThough the team suffered a loss, Lonnie says his son left mentally strong.\n\n\"One-hundred and forty-one shots is an incredible amount of shots. Ninety-eight saves. He [Landyn] got close to making 100 saves in the game,\" Scott said.\n\nThe game has attracted plenty of chatter online.\n\n\"I truly believe something like that should never happen, especially at the AAA level. There were many ways to prevent that kind of scoreline\u2014something as simple as having their players switch hands,\" said a traveling hockey parent, who requested to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution. \"The Belle Tire kids should never have had to endure that experience. It's embarrassing, and I think the parents and coaches involved should have done more to control it. We have to do better as adults as we try to motivate, inspire and help these young boys develop into men.\"\n\n\"It's about more than just hockey, and they're developing as people, and adversity is something they're going to face all the time,\" Scott said.\n\nScott believes Wednesday's game was just a bump in the road. He's shocked at the outreach he's received from the hockey community.\n\n\"The thing I want most out of this is to take a step back and take a look at what really happened. Little Caesars is a great team, and our team never quits,\" he said.\n\nAccording to my hockeyrankings.com, Little Caesar's ranks first in the U.S., while Belle Tire is ranked 301st. But Lonnie says he'd have no other team coaching his son.\n\n\"He didn't give up and neither did his teammates,\" Scott said.",

WHEN INTERVIEWED BY A DETECTIVE, GIRARD ADMITTED TO ALTERING THOSE RECORDS. THE ESTIMATED LOSS FOR MARQUETTE\n\nAdvertisement Man faces charges for decade of rent-free living through Marquette database fraud According to the criminal complaint, Michael Gerard saved about $63,500 by altering housing databases through his job. Share Copy Link Copy\n\nA 40-year-old man is facing charges after allegedly altering Marquette housing data through his job, which allowed him to live rent-free for over a decade.According to the criminal complaint, Michael Gerard worked for Marquette University's Office of Residence Life. Gerard also lived in an apartment near 17th and Wells streets through that job as well, but was still required to pay rent. He was living there from 2013 until 2024.Through his job, Gerard was able to access the universities residence life internal databases. He also had the ability to create and change entries in the program, according to the complaint.He lived in the apartment and paid his rent during the 2013-2014 school year. In the 2014-15 school year, though, Gerard stopped paying his rent and avoided it being billed to his Marquette account. According to the complaint, in December 2014, he then started to change the status of his apartment to make it seem as if a staff member was living there, or there was a buyout of the room. ORL records show that he was charged rent in the 2015 fall term and the 2016 spring term, but these charges were all reversed.He allegedly did this by accessing Marquette's internal computer programs and altered data to explain why rent was not being collected from that unit. These changes allowed him to live rent free from 2016 to 2024. He was able to save around $63,500 by doing this.During the investigation, Gerard initially claimed the former director of residence life gave him permission to use the apartment rent-free before admitting he was the one who made all of the changes in the database. He feared the new director in 2015 would tell him he was not eligible to live in the apartment.Gerard is facing one count of theft for false representation and computer crimes by modifying data.Top HeadlinesPassenger dead, driver arrested in Milwaukee rollover crashMilwaukee teen goes on armed robbery spree, leads police on 21-mile chaseOver $9,000 worth of goods stolen from closed Thiensville restaurant, 3 people chargedWATCH Police squad hit and run",

Then, each time he would take a saw he brought to break open the drop safe underneath the cash register. The drop safe is where cashiers put large bills.\n\nThen, he would go fix the drive-thru window and leave the Burger King with the cash out of a side service door.\n\nThat worked at the first four Burger King burglaries.\n\n\"This time there was nothing in the drop safe. It was empty,\" said Tiffany Skonieczny, detective with the Milwaukee Police Department. \"The others there was a substantial amount in the drop safe but this one for some reason, on that day, did not have any money in it. So, all this damage was done to the drive through and the drop safe. The company probably changed something. And that is why there was no money in the drop safe.\"\n\nDetectives believe the man worked at a Burger King or somehow gained intimate knowledge of where the drop safe is located, and where an alarm wouldn't sound.\n\nIf you know anything about who has been burglarizing Burger King locations in the Milwaukee area, call Crime Stoppers at (414) 224-Tips or P3 Tips. Your tip is always anonymous, and if your tip leads to an arrest, you get cash.",

                "text": "With just a few words, AI models can be prompted to create a story, an image, or even a short film. But according to Weber Wong, these models are all \u201cmade by non-creatives for other non-creatives to feel creative.\u201d\n\nIn other words, they\u2019re not built for actual creative professionals. That\u2019s something Wong is hoping to change with Flora, a new startup where he\u2019s founder and CEO.\n\nFlora launched this week, complete with a manifesto declaring that \u201cAI creative tools should be more than toys for generating AI slop\u201d and describing Wong and his team as \u201cobsessed with building a power tool that will profoundly shape the future of creative work.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto positions Flora as something different from existing AI tools, which \u201cmake it easy to create, but lack creative control,\u201d and from existing creative software, which gives users \u201ccontrol, but are unintuitive & time-consuming.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Flora /\n\nFlora isn\u2019t trying to build better generative AI models. Wong argued that one of the startup\u2019s key insights is that \u201cmodels are not creative tools.\u201d So instead, Flora offers an \u201cinfinite canvas\u201d that integrates with existing models \u2014 it\u2019s a visual interface where users can generate blocks of text, images, and video.\n\n\u201cThe model does not matter, the technology does not matter,\u201d Wong told me \u201cIt\u2019s about the interface.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user could start by prompting Flora to create an image of a flower, then ask for details about the image, with those details leading to more prompts and varied images, with each step and variation mapped out on the aforementioned canvas, which can also be shared for collaborative work with clients.\n\nWong told me he wants Flora to be useful to any and all artists and creatives, but the company is initially focused on working with visual design agencies. In fact, it\u2019s iterating on the product with feedback from designers at famed agency Pentagram.\n\nThe goal, Wong said, is to allow a designer at Pentagram to \u201cjust do 100X more creative work,\u201d say by creating a logo design and then quickly generating 100 variations. He compared it to the evolution of musical composition \u2014 where Mozart \u201cneeded an entire orchestra to play his music,\u201d a musician today can get it all done \u201cfrom his garage in New Jersey with Ableton, making it himself and posting it on SoundCloud.\u201d\n\nWong has a background in both art and technology himself, having worked as an investor at Menlo Ventures but leaving when he realized, \u201cI was not the person I\u2019d back.\u201d Determined to become the kind of founder worth investing in, he eventually joined New York University\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program, a graduate program focused on using technology to create art.\n\nWhen Flora launched an alpha version in August, Wong decided to \u201claunch with an art project that showcased our real-time AI technology,\u201d with the Flora homepage showing a live feed from a GoPro camera on Wong\u2019s head, and website visitors getting the opportunity to use AI to stylize the footage after signing up for the Flora waitlist.\n\nImage Credits:Flora /\n\nGiven his background, Wong knows there are artists and professionals who are skeptical or even vehemently opposed to the use of AI in art \u2014 in fact, Pentagram generated some controversy last year when it used Midjourney to create the illustration style for a project with the US government.\n\nWong said that where existing models have been embraced by \u201cAI natives,\u201d he\u2019s hoping Flora can win over the \u201cAI curious,\u201d and eventually become useful enough that even \u201cAI haters\u201d feel they have to give it a try.\n\nWhen I raised concerns that AI models can be trained without regard for copyright and intellectual property, Wong noted that Flora isn\u2019t training any AI models itself (because it\u2019s using other companies\u2019 models), adding, \u201cWe will follow societal standards.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s passionate about not wanting Flora to be used to unleash a flood of AI slop (\u201cWe\u2019re going to get hats that say \u2018anti-AI slop\u2019\u201d), he suggested that instead, the startup will allow artists to unlock \u201cnew aesthetic and creative possibilities,\u201d in the same way Kodak\u2019s Brownie camera transformed photography by making it more casual and accessible.\n\nFlora isn\u2019t disclosing funding details, but its backers include A16Z Games Speedrun, Menlo Ventures, and Long Journey Ventures, as well as angels from Midjourney, Stability, and Pika. The product is available for free with a limited number of projects and generated content, and then professional pricing starts at $16 per month.",

                "text": "Chinese AI startup DeepSeek recently declared that its AI models could be very profitable \u2014 with some asterisks.\n\nIn a post on X, DeepSeek boasted that its online services have a \u201ccost profit margin\u201d of 545%. However, that margin is calculated based on \u201ctheoretical income.\u201d\n\nIt discussed these numbers in more detail at the end of a longer GitHub post outlining its approach to achieving \u201chigher throughput and lower latency.\u201d The company wrote that when it looks at usage of its V3 and R1 models during a 24-hour period, if that usage had all been billed using R1 pricing, DeepSeek would already have $562,027 in daily revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of leasing the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) would have been just $87,072.\n\nThe company admitted that its actual revenue is \u201csubstantially lower\u201d for a variety of reasons, like nighttime discounts, lower pricing for V3, and the fact that \u201conly a subset of services are monetized,\u201d with web and app access remaining free.\n\nOf course, if the app and website weren\u2019t free, and if other discounts weren\u2019t available, usage would presumably be much lower. So these calculations seem to be highly speculative \u2014 more a gesture towards potential future profit margins than a real snapshot of DeepSeek\u2019s bottom line right now.\n\nBut the company is sharing these numbers amidst broader debates about AI\u2019s cost and potential profitability. DeepSeek leapt into the spotlight in January, with a new model that supposedly matched OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain benchmarks, despite being developed at a much lower cost, and in the face of U.S. trade restrictions that prevent Chinese companies from accessing the most powerful chips. Tech stocks tumbled and analysts raised questions about AI spending.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s tech didn\u2019t just rattle Wall Street. Its app briefly displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT at the top of Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 though it\u2019s subsequently fallen off the general rankings and is currently ranked #6 in productivity, behind ChatGPT, Grok, and Google Gemini.",

The ChatGPT maker says its OpenAI Startup Fund is raised from outside investors. This includes participation from significant OpenAI backer Microsoft, as well as \u201cother OpenAI partners,\u201d according to the fund\u2019s website.\n\nThe OpenAI Startup Fund, which is managed by a dedicated team, has so far invested in over a dozen startups, according to data providers PitchBook and Crunchbase and TechCrunch\u2019s research.\n\nThe following companies, organized alphabetically, have themselves announced investments from the fund.\n\n1X: This Norwegian humanoid robot startup raised $23.5 million in a deal led by the OpenAI Startup Fund and Tiger Global in early 2023. However, OpenAI\u2019s fund wasn\u2019t named as a participant in the company when it announced its $100 million Series B in January.\n\nAmbience Healthcare: This AI-powered medical note-taking startup announced a $70 million Series B in February 2024, co-led by OpenAI\u2019s fund and Kleiner Perkins.

                "text": "Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France\u2019s most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. But compared to its $6 billion valuation, its global market share is still relatively low.\n\nHowever, the recent launch of its chat assistant on mobile app stores was met with some hype, particularly in its home country. \u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris.\n\nWhile this wave of attention may be encouraging, Mistral AI still faces challenges in competing with the likes of OpenAI \u2014 and in doing so while keeping up with its self-definition as \u201cthe world\u2019s greenest and leading independent AI lab.\u201d\n\nWhat is Mistral AI?\n\nMistral AI has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to \u201cput frontier AI in the hands of everyone.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company\u2019s advocacy for openness in AI.\n\nIts alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is now also available on iOS and Android. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France\u2019s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.\n\nThis comes in addition to Mistral AI\u2019s suite of models, which includes:\n\nWho are Mistral AI\u2019s founders?\n\nMistral AI\u2019s three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google\u2019s DeepMind, while CTO Timoth\u00e9e Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.\n\nCo-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister C\u00e9dric O, which caused controversy due to his previous role.\n\nAre Mistral AI\u2019s models open source?\n\nNot all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nFree models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open-sourced in July 2024.\n\nHow does Mistral AI make money?\n\nWhile many of Mistral AI\u2019s offerings are free or now have free tiers, Mistral AI plans to drive some revenue from Le Chat\u2019s paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat\u2019s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.\n\nOn the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.\n\nOverall, however, Mistral AI\u2019s revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.\n\nWhat partnerships has Mistral AI closed?\n\nIn 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform and a \u20ac15 million investment. The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn\u2019t qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU.\n\nIn January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP\u2019s entire text archive dating back to 1983.\n\nMistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France\u2019s army and job agency, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.\n\nAs of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around \u20ac1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.\n\nIn June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest ever \u2014 valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million.\n\nOther investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.\n\nOnly six months later, it closed a Series A of \u20ac385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.\n\nThe $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.\n\nIn June 2024, Mistral AI then raised \u20ac600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.\n\nWhat could a Mistral AI exit look like?\n\nMistral is \u201cnot for sale,\u201d Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cOf course, [an IPO is] the plan.\u201d\n\nThis makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer.\n\nHowever, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its nearly $6 billion valuation. Either way, stay tuned.",

                "text": "SymbyAI, a SaaS platform that uses AI to streamline scientific research, announced a $2.1 million seed round with participation from Drive Capital and CharacterVC, among others.\n\nLaunched just last year by Ashia Livaudais and Michael House, the platform provides organized workspaces for researchers to access papers, code, data, and experiences within one place. It helps track progress and has an AI-feature that assists with peer review and replication.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that SymbyAI is built on a proprietary AI solution, so users don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally sending confidential information to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other company,\u201d Livaudais told TechCrunch. The researchers\u2019 intellectual property remains the property of the owners and is not used to train SymbyAI\u2019s underlying models.\n\nLivaudais said she started the company after dealing firsthand with the archaic system of reviewing and creating science.\n\n\u201cThe foundations of Symby were formed while creating a solution to a problem that I was facing every day, and then realizing that my colleagues in the research community were looking for solutions to the exact same problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time we realized that we could successfully and repeatedly shorten critical research processes from months to hours, demand for a productized version started to emerge from almost every discovery conversation I had.\u201d\n\nSymbyAI works with academic publishers, research organizations, and universities. Livaudais said she met her investors by first taking part in the gBeta program, which is part of gener8tor. Through the gBeta program, Livaudais connected with her first investors, including Antler, which Livaudais said took an early chance on Symby by investing in its pre-seed round, too.\n\nThe company now plans to use the fresh seed capital to continue building out the company and fulfill initial partnerships.",

                "text": "Longevity is a hot trend in Silicon Valley these days, driven by rising interest \u2014 especially among the wealthy \u2014 in preventing disease through regular testing.\n\nA new player, Biograph, has just emerged from stealth, and it\u2019s co-founded by one of the biggest names in longevity science: Dr. Peter Attia. Attia is a Canadian-American physician best known as the author of the bestseller \u201cOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevity\u201d and for his podcast.\n\nBiograph\u2019s CEO and other co-founder is John Hering, a prominent Silicon Valley figure. A cybersecurity founder who infamously scanned celebrities\u2019 cellphones at the 2005 Academy Awards, Hering has become best known as one Elon Musk\u2019s biggest backers through his role as a partner at Vy Capital. There, Hering has poured billions into Musk\u2019s startups and donated $500,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC before the election, per a WSJ profile.\n\nBiograph calls itself the world\u2019s \u201cmost advanced\u201d preventive health and diagnostics clinic. It currently has a location in Silicon Valley with plans to open in New York City this quarter, and eventually expand globally, according to an announcement on its website.\n\nThe startup says it will collect over 1,000 data points across 30+ evaluations to paint a holistic picture of someone\u2019s health and optimize their lifespan. It doesn\u2019t come cheap: Its Core membership costs $7,500 per year while the premium Black membership \u2014 which it says provides the \u201cdeepest insights\u201d \u2014 runs $15,000.\n\nBiograph is backed by Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors including Balaji Srinivasan, the startup told TechCrunch. Biograph declined to specify how much funding it has raised.\n\nIn a statement, Hering said he was inspired to co-found Biograph by the cancer diagnosis of his Vy Capital partner and friend Alexander Tamas. Tamas posted on X that a check-up in his late 30s resulted in an early thyroid cancer diagnosis that probably saved his life \u2014 and caused him to encourage Hering to get checked, too.\n\nBiograph claims that over 15% of members have reported discovering \u201curgent or life-alerting health\u201d insights through its services. The company has been quietly operating since 2020, according to the LinkedIn profile of its executive medical director, Michael Doney, a doctor with a background in longevity.\n\nWhile Biograph\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mention AI, the company is currently looking for a founding AI engineer to build an AI-powered assistant, according to its careers page.\n\nBiograph is part of a quiet boom in startups dedicated to living longer, with Andreessen Horowitz-backed Function Health seeking a $2 billion valuation this year and Sam Altman-backed Retro Biosciences in talks to raise a cool $1 billion last month.",

The startup claims to be building \u201cAl performance monitoring for factory workers,\u201d but others called it \u201csweatshops-as-a-service.\u201d\n\nBreakthrough points: Palo Alto-based startup Inception claims to have developed a diffusion-based large language model (DLM). Diffusion models that already exist are mainly used to create images, video, and audio, while Inception hopes to compete with LLMs.\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nImage Credits:Ilya Melnikov / Quantum Machines under a license.\n\nThis week, several startups secured funding rounds that were notably large for their respective stages, and there are new funds ready to be deployed at the growth stage.\n\nRecord round: Israeli startup Quantum Machines secured one of the biggest funding rounds a quantum computing company raised to date with its $170 million Series C led by PSG Equity with participation from Intel Capital, Red Dot Capital Partners, and existing investors.\n\nFull circle: Shop Circle, which makes an app suite for e-commerce, raised a $60 million Series B round that also financed the acquisition of Aiden, an AI-powered \u201cguided-selling\u201d software maker.\n\nMagic arms: Polish startup Nomagic, which makes robotic arms for logistics operations, raised a $44 million Series B led by the VC arm of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). It plans to use some of the funding to reach customers in North America.\n\nMagic touch: Taktile, a New York-based startup that helps fintechs build automated decision-making workflows, closed a $54 million Series B led by Balderton Capital with participation from Index Ventures, Tiger Global, YC, Prosus Ventures, and Visionaries Club.\n\nIdea relay: Relay raised a $35 million Series A round led by London-based VC Plural to bring the \u201casset-free\u201d last-mile parcel delivery model from Asia to Europe, in an approach that also reduces energy consumption and relies on e-bikes.\n\nLoved: Lovable, a fast-growing app-building AI platform coming out of Sweden, secured $15 million in a pre-Series A round led by Creandum. It also said it reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue after scaling to 30,000 paying customers with only $2 million spent.\n\nEuropean growth: Private equity firm Thoma Bravo closed an inaugural $1.9 billion European fund to deepen its presence in the region and take fresh equity stakes in midsized software companies across the continent.\n\nCambridge growth: Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC), a British fund that invests exclusively in the ecosystem around the University of Cambridge, launched a $126 million opportunity fund.\n\nLast but not least\n\nImage Credits:Anna Fedorenko / Getty Images\n\nThis week marked the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

                "text": "Snowflake plans to expand its startup accelerator with $200 million in additional commitments, the tech giant that specializes in cloud-based data storage said Thursday.\n\nThe new injection of capital follows a string of activity by Snowflake over the past several months that illustrates that company\u2019s growth ambitions.\n\nThe Snowflake Startup Accelerator, formerly known as the Powered by Snowflake Funding Program, invests in a broad range of early-stage startups. Notably, the accelerator invests in startups building AI-based industry-specific products on Snowflake. Startups in the accelerator receive technical support from Snowflake and access to co-marketing opportunities, as well as credits for Amazon\u2019s public cloud, AWS.\n\nGraduates from previous cohorts include Coalesce, Andrew Ng\u2019s LandingAI, and Twelve Labs.\n\nA portion of the fresh $200 million will come from Snowflake\u2019s new and existing VC partners, including Bain Capital Ventures, Blackstone Innovations Investments, Bessemer Venture Partners, Capital One Ventures, General Catalyst, Greylock Partners, Hetz Ventures, Mayfield, NewBuild Venture Capital, NTTVC, and Virtue.\n\nThere\u2019s some fine print to be aware of. Snowflake noted in a blog post that while participating VC firms may invest in Snowflake Startup Accelerator companies, there\u2019s \u201cno guarantee\u201d that any particular company will receive funding or that the full target amount will be invested.\n\nSnowflake, which also announced plans for a new 30,000-square-foot \u201cAI hub\u201d at its Menlo Park campus and a $20 million AI upskilling program, continues to invest aggressively in AI. Earlier this week, the company announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to offer access to AI models from OpenAI. Late last year, Snowflake inked a multi-year partnership with Anthropic and acquired Datavolo, an AI data pipeline firm.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s strategy appears to be paying off. The company beat Wall Street analyst estimates for its most recent fiscal quarter (Q4 2024), notching $987 million in revenue.",

                "text": "AI has brought attention to all kinds of futuristic technologies, from humanoid robots to autonomous warships. But there\u2019s a quieter boom happening in a highly traditional industry: accounting. VCs are excited by the prospect of automating costly human labor with AI, funding companies like Numeric and Kick last year, to name a few.\n\nThe latest startup to ride this wave is Quanta, which sells an AI-powered accounting platform to software companies and has raised a $4.7 million seed round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch. Other investors include basecase, Comma Capital, and San Francisco angel investor Elad Gil.\n\nQuanta traces its origins to founder Helen Hastings\u2019 time as a software engineer at buy now, pay later company Affirm, where she saw firsthand how outdated accounting software was. Getting good financial data was highly manual and resulted in reports that only came out once a month.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to build something from scratch that could help financial teams and business leaders be more efficient,\u201d Hastings told TechCrunch.\n\nSo Quanta\u2019s platform hoovers up data from a company\u2019s existing fintech tools like Brex, Mercury, or Stripe to automatically produce books and real-time reports.\n\nThat\u2019s a vision that has tripped up other startups like Bench, which tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to automate some of its expensive human bookkeepers (600 strong at its peak) with AI. But Hastings says Quanta will avoid this conundrum by building an AI-first product before hiring lots of bookkeepers. So naturally, it also only initially accepted customers for which its automated system could perform all of the accounting.\n\nThe fundraise is also a personal milestone for Hastings as a female founder in a space that\u2019s dominated by men. The percentage of funding that goes to female-only founded companies like Quanta stood at only 2% in 2024, according to PitchBook data. Hastings says that a college instructor once told her that he didn\u2019t picture her becoming a founder. But moments like that one only invigorate her more.\n\nWith this fundraise, Hastings says Quanta plans to move beyond its current niche of early-stage software companies to larger businesses, including ones with multiple corporate entities. Hastings says she\u2019s excited for larger organizations to \u201cexpect more\u201d from their accounting tools \u201cbeyond what incumbents have been able to handle.\u201d",

                "text": "AI has the power to transform how people work, but getting tangible value out of AI isn\u2019t as easy as throwing any AI application at any workflow. It can be hard for enterprises to figure out which AI applications help their business and which are just hype. Workhelix wants to solve that problem.\n\nWorkhelix is a tech-enabled service startup that works with enterprises to better understand and monitor AI automation at their companies. Workhelix breaks down a company\u2019s employee positions into specific job functions and tasks and scores each task for its suitability for AI adoption. This helps companies build roadmaps for how and where to adopt AI and gives enterprises a way to monitor if the AI they adopted is working.\n\nCo-founder and CEO James Milin told TechCrunch that many companies are getting AI adoption wrong because they are looking to apply AI to whole divisions of their business, which is too broad to find value.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a systematic, rigorous way to adopt generative AI and is part of the reason people are frequently so disappointed,\u201d Milin said. \u201cBut if you look at all the jobs in an organization and break them down into bundles of tasks, and then score each task for its suitability to be accelerated by generative AI, now you can come up with a really quantitative rigorous way to adopt it.\u201d\n\nWorkhelix\u2019s methodology of breaking down roles into tasks is based on years of research into the relationship between technology and productivity by Erik Brynjolfsson (pictured above), the director of Stanford\u2019s Digital Economy Lab and one of Workhelix\u2019s co-founders.\n\n\u201cIn the case of a lot of our work, there\u2019s this long tale of tasks that the machines actually don\u2019t help that much with,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cYou need humans to be involved. And then there\u2019s other tasks where the machines are very helpful. And almost every project that we look at, there\u2019s some of each of those.\u201d\n\nBrynjolfsson told TechCrunch that he\u2019s been researching this divide between technology and productivity for well over a decade. Prior to Workhelix, Brynjolfsson was sharing this research and methodology through published papers or through speaker gigs in board rooms, but he realized that if they added a software element, they could reach more companies.\n\nBrynjolfsson, also the co-chairman of Workhelix, paired up with Andrew McAfee, the co-director of the MIT initiative on the digital economy, and one of Brynjolfsson\u2019s co-authors; Daniel Rock, a Wharton professor; and Milin to launch Workhelix in 2022.\n\nThe company launched its product in April 2024 and has seen strong demand from enterprise customers, including Accenture, Wayfair, and Coursera, among others. Workhelix\u2019s first dozen enterprise customers came through the door with zero paid advertising, Milin said.\n\n\u201cThis is something that they\u2019re really hungry for,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. There are consultants out there, but they don\u2019t have these kinds of tools. We\u2019re filling a huge gap. I think the biggest gap there is in the market.\u201d\n\nThe company recently raised a $15 million Series A round led by AIX Ventures with participation from Andrew Ng\u2019s AI Fund, Accenture Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta, among other VCs. It also received funding from a number of angel investors, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, OpenAI co-founder Mira Murati, and Jeff Dean, the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, among others.\n\nShaun Johnson, a founding partner at AIX Ventures, told TechCrunch that he was introduced to the company through Brynjolfsson\u2019s work at Stanford; one of AIX Ventures\u2019 investing partners, Christopher Manning, is the director of Stanford\u2019s artificial intelligence laboratory. Johnson said he understood the pain point Workhelix was trying to solve right away.\n\n\u201cErik, Andy, and Daniel have amazing access to the Fortune 500 C-suite and access to customers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s extreme founder-market fit and their approach is extreme founder-product fit. That caused us to want to dive in.\u201d\n\nWorkhelix plans to put its recently raised capital toward expanding the number of tasks and KPIs its software tracks. It will also keep building up the internal tools for the data scientists that directly help enterprise customers alongside Workhelix\u2019s product.\n\nIn today\u2019s market that\u2019s obsessed with moving fast and automation, it\u2019s interesting that Workhelix\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just software but also includes a human element, too. The company stands by this approach, although this does make it harder for it to scale. That\u2019s because the company wouldn\u2019t be as effective if it were just another software platform, Milin said.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a trillion-dollar opportunity here to create value,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cNot that we\u2019re going to capture all, or even most of that, but we want to unlock that. As James said earlier, this is the biggest technological revolution that\u2019s ever happened and very few people are thinking about unlocking the business side of it.\u201d",

                "text": "Deepnight co-founders Lucas Young and Thomas Li have been friends since childhood. Both were working as software engineers at Google when Young decided he wanted to crack the code, so to speak, on a problem that had plagued the U.S. military for decades: digital night vision tech.\n\nMost night vision technology is still analog. Goggles use optical lenses and a chemical process to convert the scant light at night into images, Young told TechCrunch. And they cost $13,000 to $30,000 apiece from military contractors like L3Harris and Elbit America.\n\nFor years, the U.S. Army has been trying to digitize the tech, mostly focused on the hardware. A case in point: the $22 billion budget for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) project that Anduril just took over from Microsoft and its HoloLens tech.\n\nYoung, who has a degree in computational photography from Cal Poly, spent five years working on smartphone camera software. He wrote code that offset the limitations of the tiny aperture, cheap $50 digital cameras used in smartphones. And Li\u2019s background is in AI tech, particularly computer vision.\n\nOne day, Young read a scientific paper from 2018 called Learning to See in the Dark, co-authored by well-known scientist Vladlen Koltun, who is currently at Apple. It discussed using AI for low-light imaging, but at the time, on-device AI chips weren\u2019t fast enough to support the 90 frames per second (fps) necessary for real-time viewing.\n\nIn 2024, Young realized that AI accelerators running on system on chips (SoCs) had advanced enough to support 90 fps. He talked his friend Li into quitting their jobs and founding a startup called Deepnight. And they promptly got into the Y Combinator winter cohort.\n\nDeepnight founders photo taken at night with a normal camera on the left versus what the company\u2019s AI model produces on the right. Image Credits:Deepnight\n\nTheir smartphone app wows the military\n\nThe military was their first obvious customer, but they couldn\u2019t just roll up to the Pentagon and book a meeting. So, Young found an industry event where people from the U.S. Army\u2019s night vision laboratory were in attendance.\n\nHe wrote a white paper that outlined his idea: night vision as a software problem. He handed out copies at the event, including to an army colonel who agreed to read the paper. \u201cIt was just a hallway conversation. I wasn\u2019t even in business attire. Just a T-shirt,\u201d Young recalls.\n\nThe colonel liked what he read enough to put the founders in touch with people at the lab, formally known as the US Army C5ISR Center.\n\nDesperate to show those folks that their concept would work, the founders built a night vision smartphone app. They put the smartphone into a smartphone-holding VR set.\n\nIt was a rudimentary prototype that was impressive enough to lead to their first sale.\n\n\u201cThe army awarded us a $100,000 contract in February 2024, one month into Y Combinator, based on the proof of concept in a smartphone demo and our whitepapers and presentation,\u201d Young said.\n\nYoung and Li then had to present their progress in a more formal demo. The pair flew to Washington, D.C., to show a room packed with 10 people how their software worked as well as state-of-the-art goggles, Young said. (Here\u2019s a YouTube video where they demo their tech.)\n\nThe meeting led to more contracts. A year after launching, the startup has booked about $4.6 million in contracts from the federal government, including the U.S. Army and Air Force, as well as with companies like Sionyx and SRI International.\n\n\n\nDeepnight also promptly attracted investors. By the end of YC, it raised a $5.5 million round led by Initialized Capital, with angels like Kulveer Taggar, former In-Q-Tel partner Brian Shin, and Matthew Bellamy, lead singer of the band Muse. Y Combinator also chipped in their standard deal.\n\nPerhaps best of all, Koltun, the scientist who wrote the paper that inspired the company, also became an angel investor.\n\nDeepnight offers software and partners with hardware makers like goggle manufacturers or military helmets or other products.\n\n\u201cNow we can make everything in the world see in the dark, because it\u2019s just a software program. So that\u2019s automotive, security, drones, maritime like boats, electronics, nav cameras,\u201d Young describes. And because it all relies on an off-the-shelf $50 smartphone camera, their tech doesn\u2019t need expensive bespoke hardware.",

                "text": "Fintech has fragmented into increasingly specialized, cucumber-sliced micro-services, ranging from embedded buy-now-pay-later loans to specialized neo banks to yet more payment processing systems. What opportunities remain for innovators in such a fragmented landscape? One U.K. startup, Just Move In, zoomed out and realised that the home had been overlooked by everyone in the industry. And it has now raised an $8 million Series A funding round led by Eos Ventures (a global insurtech VC) for its home setup services.\n\nThe strategic backing of Eos Ventures means it will expand into embedded financial services, simplifying processes such as securing credit and insurance products. The company says it\u2019s now projected to process over 400,000 home moves in 2025.\n\nThe \u2018trick\u2019 \u2014 if there is one \u2014 is that while comparison sites provide options for people switching utilities and insurance providers, they often create a fragmented and time-consuming for users. By contrast, Just Move In creates a single point of entry to managing multiple services.\n\nAlso participating in the round were Wayra (the innovation arm of Telef\u00f3nica), and Second Century Ventures. It also has continued support from The FSE Group and angels including Simon Rogerson and Chris Hulatt, founders of Octopus Group. Its last funding round was in 2022, when it raised a \u00a34 million seed round (around $5 million at current exchange rates).\n\nIn turns, Just Move In embeds services from Openrent (the biggest letting agency in the UK) and real estate agent Hamptons, as well as Alto (a residential property software, data, and insight company) and Anyvan.\n\n\u201cWhen you move in, there are dozens of services that need to be connected such as council tax, water, sewage, gas, energy, broadband, home insurance. The list goes on,\u201d co-founder Ross Nichols told TechCrunch over a call. \u201cWe have built a platform that helps to streamline that process.\u201d\n\nJust Move In takes the information about the property from the estate agent\u2019s CRM and analyses the services available. \u201cSo you come into our journey, and rather than having to end up on a dozen plus different websites to complete all those transactions and repeat your payment details, you do it once, and it\u2019s set up for you,\u201d said Nichols.\n\n\u201cThe main benefit for the customer is they\u2019re saving a huge amount of time and it\u2019s free service. We get paid in the same way that a price comparison site works. So we are competing indirectly now with the big price comparison sites, but we\u2019re embedded into the flow of the move,\u201d he added.\n\nJust move In is now managing over 300,000 moves in the UK, close to 10% of the UK market.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to take this to Europe,\u201d Nichols told TehCrunch.\n\nIn a statement, James Tootell, Partner at Eos Ventures, said: \u201cJust Move In\u2019s innovative approach to combining home services with financial products represents the future of consumer-focused FinTech.\u201d",

                "text": "The automated logic behind many financial decisions \u2014 for example, decisions that determine whether a client is approved for a credit line \u2014 is hard-coded. Often, it\u2019s not easily changed. If a head of credit at a bank wanted to adjust the bank\u2019s lending criteria, for example, they\u2019d likely have to raise a ticket with IT.\n\nEntrepreneurs Maximilian Eber and Maik Taro Wehmeyer, who met while studying at Harvard, ran up against the limitations of financial decisioning logic while at QuantCo, a company building AI-powered apps for enterprise customers. In 2020, the pair decided to found a startup, Taktile, to make modifying automated decisioning logic a more self-service process.\n\n\u201cWe realized that we were building the same things over and over again, and decided to leverage our learnings to build a platform around it,\u201d Wehmeyer, Taktile\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nTaktile\u2019s platform \u2014 which we\u2019ve written about before \u2014 lets risk and engineering teams at fintech firms create and manage workflows for automated decision-making. Users can experiment with data integrations and monitor the performance of predictive models in their decision flows, and perform A/B tests to evaluate each flow.\n\nFor example, a bank could use Taktile to anticipate how moving the minimum age to apply for an account from 25 to 21 might affect customer churn. Or a loan provider could build a workflow that automatically extracts information from documents, summarizes cases, and recommends next steps for manual review.\n\nTaktile\u2019s backend dashboard. Image Credits:Taktile\n\n\u201c[W]e have invested [significantly] in our data layer,\u201d Wehmeyer said, \u201cwhich lets users build a complete picture of their end customers across all relevant decision moments, from initial onboarding to fraud checks, and operational decisions like collections.\u201d\n\nThere is competition in the space. Noble, for example, offers a rules-based engine to edit and launch credit models, and vendors like PowerCurve sell comparable tools focused on unblocking risk teams.\n\nTaktile appears to be growing at a healthy clip, however. Annual recurring revenue climbed 3.5x year-over-year in 2024, and the company\u2019s client base recently expanded to include fintech companies such as Zilch and Mercury.\n\n\u201c[Legacy] software is just hopelessly outdated,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve won many pitches because even if we were weaker than a specialized vendor in one case, customers want an end-to-end solution.\u201d\n\nThis week, New York-based Taktile announced that it closed a $54 million Series B funding round led by Balderton Capital with participation from Index Ventures, Tiger Global, Y Combinator, Prosus Ventures, Visionaries Club, and OpenAI board member Larry Summers. This brings the 110-person company\u2019s total raised to $79 million; the new capital will be put toward product development and building out Taktile\u2019s enterprise sales organization.\n\n\u201cThere was no need to raise from a money perspective \u2014 we still had more than two years of runway \u2014 but we saw huge investor demand because of strong growth in 2024,\u201d Wehmeyer said. \u201cFintech and financial services tends to be a low-margin business, so people do care about the unit economics a lot. Vendor consolidation is something that people are looking at this year.\u201d",

She faced pregnancy complications and, since she grew up with a family full of doctors, was able to identify some symptoms that were missed by medical staff. The experience led her to build a maternity clinic \u2014 the one she would have wanted while she was giving birth.\n\nThe result is Millie, which launched in 2022. It offers maternity and gynecology care, as well as postpartum coaching, mental health care, and nutrition counseling. It works with all major insurance companies and there is in-person and virtual support, with a tech platform that provides patient monitoring tools. Others in this space include Diana Health and Oula.\n\n\u201cWhat makes Millie unique is our hybrid model which combines in-person care at our clinics with virtual visits, remote monitoring, and a proprietary app,\u201d Sharma told TechCrunch. \u201cWe do this with a capital efficient model, increasingly powered by AI-enabled workflows, in collaboration with payors and health system partners.\u201d\n\nMillie\u2019s cap table consists of all female-led firms.

                "text": "Inception, a new Palo Alto-based company started by Stanford computer science professor Stefano Ermon, claims to have developed a novel AI model based on \u201cdiffusion\u201d technology. Inception calls it a diffusion-based large language model, or a \u201cDLM\u201d for short.\n\nThe generative AI models receiving the most attention now can be broadly divided into two types: large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. LLMs are used for text generation. Meanwhile, diffusion models, which power AI systems like Midjourney and OpenAI\u2019s Sora, are mainly used to create images, video, and audio.\n\nInception\u2019s model offers the capabilities of traditional LLMs, including code generation and question-answering, but with significantly faster performance and reduced computing costs, according to the company.\n\nErmon told TechCrunch that he has been studying how to apply diffusion models to text for a long time in his Stanford lab. His research was based on the idea that traditional LLMs are relatively slow compared to diffusion technology.\n\nWith LLMs, \u201cyou cannot generate the second word until you\u2019ve generated the first one, and you cannot generate the third one until you generate the first two,\u201d Ermon said.\n\nErmon was looking for a way to apply a diffusion approach to text because, unlike with LLMs, which work sequentially, diffusion models start with a rough estimate of data they\u2019re generating (e.g. ,a picture), and then bring the data into focus all at once.\n\nErmon hypothesized generating and modifying large blocks of text in parallel was possible with diffusion models. After years of trying, Ermon and a student of his achieved a major breakthrough, which they detailed in a research paper published last year.\n\nRecognizing the advancement\u2019s potential, Ermon founded Inception last summer, tapping two former students, UCLA professor Aditya Grover and Cornell professor Volodymyr Kuleshov, to co-lead the company.\n\nWhile Ermon declined to discuss Inception\u2019s funding, TechCrunch understands that the Mayfield Fund has invested.\n\nInception has already secured several customers, including unnamed Fortune 100 companies, by addressing their critical need for reduced AI latency and increased speed, Emron said.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that our models can leverage the GPUs much more efficiently,\u201d Ermon said, referring to the computer chips commonly used to run models in production. \u201cI think this is a big deal. This is going to change the way people build language models.\u201d\n\nInception offers an API as well as on-premises and edge device deployment options, support for model fine-tuning, and a suite of out-of-the-box DLMs for various use cases. The company claims its DLMs can run up to 10x faster than traditional LLMs while costing 10x less.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018small\u2019 coding model is as good as [OpenAI\u2019s] GPT-4o mini while more than 10 times as fast,\u201d a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cOur \u2018mini\u2019 model outperforms small open-source models like [Meta\u2019s] Llama 3.1 8B and achieves more than 1,000 tokens per second.\u201d\n\n\u201cTokens\u201d is industry parlance for bits of raw data. One thousand tokens per second is an impressive speed indeed, assuming Inception\u2019s claims hold up.",

                "text": "A new startup wants to help developers create customized, contextual coding assistants that can connect with any model and integrate seamlessly with their development environments.\n\nFounded in June 2023 by CEO Ty Dunn and CTO Nate Sesti (pictured above), Y Combinator alum Continue has already garnered some 23,000 stars on GitHub and 11,000 Discord community members over the past couple of years. To build on this momentum, Continue is announcing version 1.0 of its product, supported by a fresh $3 million in seed funding.\n\nCoding assistant explosion\n\nContinue\u2019s launch comes amid an explosion in AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Google\u2019s Gemini Code Assist, not to mention younger upstarts such as Codeium and Cursor, which have raised bucketloads of cash from investors.\n\nContinue, for its part, pitches itself as \u201cthe leading open-source AI code assistant\u201d that can connect with any model and lets teams add their own context by pulling in data from platforms like Jira or Confluence.\n\nWith their models and context connected, developers can create custom autocomplete and chat experiences directly inside their coding environment. Autocomplete, for instance, provides in-line code suggestions as they type, while chat allows users to ask questions about a specific piece of code. The edit function also enables users to modify code by describing what changes they want to make.\n\nContinue\u2019s AI coding assistant in action Image Credits:Continue\n\nThe product facet of today\u2019s announcement includes the first \u201cmajor\u201d release of Continue\u2019s open source extensions for VS Code and JetBrains.\n\n\u201cThis signals to enterprises that this is a stable project you can bet on and build on,\u201d Dunn told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\nSeparately, Continue is also launching a new hub, which can be likened to something like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Hugging Face \u2014 a place for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants, replete with a registry for defining and managing the various building blocks they\u2019re made from.\n\nAt launch, the hub includes pre-built AI coding assistants, as well as \u201cblocks\u201d from verified partners Mistral and its Codestral model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet from Anthropic, and DeepSeek-R1 from Ollama. However, any individual vendor or developer can contribute blocks and assistants to the hub.\n\nA block here could mean models, which let you specify which AI model to use and where; rules for customizing the AI assistant; context to define the external context provider (e.g. Jira or Confluence); prompts to pack prewritten model prompts for invoking complex instructions; docs to define documentation sites (e.g. Angular or React); data, which allow developers to send development data to a predefined destination for analytical purposes; or MCP servers, which define a standard way of building and sharing tools for language models.\n\nContinue Hub Image Credits:Continue\n\n\u201cCulture of contribution\u201d\n\nThe idea behind this new hub is that the majority of users won\u2019t require deep customizations \u2014 they\u2019ll only need to make minor tweaks to coding assistants or blocks that already exist in the hub.\n\nThis raises the question: What is the incentive for creating customizations and sharing them with the world? As it turns out, it\u2019s exactly what drives open source communities elsewhere. Many of the launch partners are the very companies that create the underlying tools or models (e.g. Mistral and Anthropic), making Continue\u2019s new hub an ideal place to curry favor with developers.\n\nMoreover, the \u201copen source ethos\u201d is at the heart of what Continue is striving for. So if someone has created any customizations for use at work, then why not just share it with the wider community? Ultimately, Continue is positioning itself as the antithesis of proprietary \u201cblack box\u201d AI assistant providers.\n\n\u201cThis is a hub for the entire ecosystem to come together and work together,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cInstead of everybody building their own closed-source AI code Assistant, what if we had an open architecture where all of us can work together to create the building blocks people need to build tailored experiences for themselves?\u201d\n\nThis is what Dunn refers to as establishing a \u201cculture of contribution,\u201d whereby developers are encouraged to experiment and create their own customizations while generating value for everyone.\n\n\u201cWith Continue 1.0, we are enabling this culture of contribution for developers to create and share custom AI code assistants,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cThis registry will be a place of discovery within and across organizations, which will grow in lock-step with the evolution of blocks and open, AI-enhanced developer tools.\u201d\n\nThen there is the data control aspect. In a more generic \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d platform, the vendor can extract significant value from observing how developers operate at scale, and feed this decision-making data back into the platform to improve things for everyone. This type of activity has created controversy for the likes of GitHub Copilot, which has been accused of hijacking the hard work of millions of open source software developers for its own gains.\n\nWith Continue, the idea is that companies have more control over what happens with their data \u2014 they can share as much or as little as they like.\n\n\u201cWhen you use Continue, you get to keep your data,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAs an organization, you can pool all of your data for all of your developers in one place. That is not possible in the one-size-fits-all, black box code assistant, where their SaaS offerings and strategy is to take your data and use it to improve it for everyone.\u201d\n\nA model business\n\nIt\u2019s still relatively early days for Continue, but the startup says it has worked with a handful of well-known businesses through the development phase \u2014 Ionos, (also an early Continue customer), as well as Siemens and Morningstar.\n\nWhile large businesses are very much in its focus, Dunn says that Continue is targeting developers of all shapes and sizes, from freelancers and small teams through the gamut of enterprises. This points to how Continue will make money \u2014 its new hub ships with a free solo tier, but organizations that need greater control over their data can pay to access additional administration, governance, and security tooling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest from larger organizations, but we\u2019ve also seen everything down to the individual developer who just wants some kind of customization for themselves. In those cases, I think the solo tier will be more than sufficient,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cBut as that freelancer or small team starts to grow, and they need some amount of governance, then they can become customers.\u201d\n\nThe free solo tier ships with three \u201cvisibility\u201d levels. A developer\u2019s contributions can be kept private, shared internally as part of a team, or made entirely public. Indeed, the solo tier can technically be used in a team setup; it just lacks some of the features that a team would typically require. A separate \u201cteams\u201d tier adds additional \u201cmulti-player\u201d smarts to the mix, with admin controls for governing all the blocks and assistants \u2014 who has access to what.\n\nThe enterprise tier, meanwhile, ramps the data, security, and governance options up a notch with more granular controls over what blocks, models, versions, and vendors are used.\n\n\u201cThe admin can also manage the security around credentials, where the data goes, and receive an audit log for the who, what, when and where of developer usage,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nContinue had previously raised $2.1 million after graduating from Y Combinator in late 2023, and it has now raised a further $3 million in SAFEs (funding with delayed equity allocation) led by developer-focused VC firm, Heavybit.\n\nDunn says the bulk of the fresh cash will go toward software engineering salaries, and it plans to \u201cat least double\u201d its current headcount of five.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using open source as a distribution approach, and so as a result, we keep our costs very low \u2014 we don\u2019t need to capitalize nearly as much as other competitors,\u201d Dunn said.",

                "text": "Capim, a startup offering Brazilians the option to buy now, pay later (BNPL) for dental services, has raised $26.7 million in Series A funding, it tells TechCrunch exclusively.\n\nFounded in July 2021 by Marcelo Lutz and Roberto Biselli, who serve as co-CEOs, S\u00e3o Paulo-based Capim describes itself as a vertical SaaS company specializing in the dental sector. It claims that its operating system helps dentists digitize and manage their clinics, and increase revenue.\n\nOne of the things Capim\u2019s software does, for example, is help patients book appointments digitally at connected clinics. On the BNPL front, the company says this offering is less expensive than an alternative like a credit card.\n\n\u201cUnlike the common practice in Brazil of paying in installments with credit cards \u2014 which requires both a credit card limit and the ability to pay within a limited number of installments \u2014 typically up to six or 12 \u2014 our solution offers greater flexibility, allowing payments of up to 36 installments,\u201d Biselli told TechCrunch. He claims that the interest rates that Capim charges are 50% lower than those charged by traditional banks.\n\nNow with its latest capital infusion, Capim plans to expand its financial offerings with a POS (point-of-sale) terminal that will offer clinics significantly lower merchant discount rates (MDR) while also integrating with its SaaS financial management module. A merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee charged to a business by the company that processes its debit and credit card transactions. The terminal will allow clinics to accept credit cards, debit cards, and PIX (Brazil\u2019s real-time payment system).\n\nThe capital will also go toward the development of what the company describes as new AI-powered tools designed to make clinical operations more efficient. The startup also plans to accelerate its go-to-market strategy to expand its network of clinics and patients.\n\nCapim\u2019s Series A round was raised in two tranches. Valor Capital and QED Investors co-led the financing, which included participation from existing investors ONEVC, Canary, and NXTP, as well as new investors Endeavor, Saison, and Actyus, a fund led by Creditas CEO Sergio Furio. The startup declined to disclose its valuation. In total it has raised about $29 million, including a $2.5 million seed round when it first launched in July of 2021.\n\nLutz and Biselli met while working on their MBAs at INSEAD, where they won the INSEAD Venture Competition in December 2020. After running a successful pilot in early 2021, they officially launched Capim upon completing their degrees.\n\nExpanding access\n\nTo date, the startup says it has helped more than 60,000 Brazilians gain access to dental procedures.\n\nWhile the company declined to disclose hard revenue figures, Lutz said it tripled its revenue in 2024, while adding more than 4,000 clinics to its client base. It currently serves 6,000 dental clinics and expects to reach over 10,000 by year\u2019s end. Capim is not yet profitable but it did \u201cbreak even\u201d at the end of last year, the co-founders say.\n\nCapim makes money in two ways: via SaaS subscriptions, which provide clinics with digital tools to manage their operations, as well as the financial products, which it says helps clinics increase patient accessibility and thus, drive more revenue.\n\nPresently, Capim has 130 employees, up from 115 a year ago.\n\nValor Capital\u2019s Carlos Costa said his firm was drawn to invest in Capim because the startup \u201caddresses clear challenges faced by professionals in managing their clinics and in financing and paying for treatments.\u201d\n\nQED Investors\u2019 Mike Packer said his firm has been following Capim since its early days.\n\n\u201cAfter watching how quickly the company scaled up with strong unit economics, we were quite convinced of early product market fit and saw that early traction as only the beginning,\u201d he told TechCrunch.",

                "text": "As scam compounds in Southeast Asia continue to drive massive campaigns targeting victims around the world, WIRED took a deeper look at how Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service provider Starlink is keeping many of those compounds in Myanmar online. Meanwhile, FTC complaints obtained by WIRED allege that an \u201cOpenAI\u201d job scam used Telegram to recruit workers in Bangladesh for months before the fraudsters suddenly disappeared.\n\nWIRED published the inside story of Russian tech executive Vladislav Klyushin, who\u2014at Vladimir Putin\u2019s behest\u2014was part of a notable US-Russia prisoner swap last summer after he was convicted and incarcerated in the US for insider trading that netted him $93 million. Earlier this week, TVs at the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, DC, showed an apparently AI-generated video on loop of Donald Trump kissing Elon Musk\u2019s feet. The words \u201cLONG LIVE THE REAL KING\u201d were superimposed over the video.\n\nWIRED conducted an investigation into Telegram groups devoted to doxing and harassing women who joined \u201cAre We Dating the Same Guy?\u201d groups on Facebook. And, as female entrepreneurs in tech face ever steeper odds of gaining support for a business, a team of female founders got seed funding and completed a series A round in a matter of months for the cloud container security firm Edera.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nAfter years of Russian cyber aggression against the United States and its longtime allies\u2014including repeated election meddling, hack and leak operations, disinformation campaigns, elaborate espionage, and brazen, disruptive cyberattacks\u2014multiple recent actions from the Trump administration have recast the US stance on the cybersecurity threats posed by the Kremlin, downplaying the risks of Russian hackers as US adversaries. The about-face comes as Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin have increasingly strengthened their ties. Consistent US intelligence community assessments of Russia's activity in cyberspace and the threat it poses to the US would indicate, though, that such a change in approach could put the US at risk.\n\nThat deprioritization of the Russia threat has come in several different forms. US State Department deputy assistant secretary for international cybersecurity Liesyl Franz said during a speech in a United Nations working group last week that the US is concerned about digital attacks from China and Iran, but did not mention Russia. A recent memo distributed at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency laid out priorities for the agency, focusing on China and defense of US systems but omitted any reference to Russia. And on Friday, the cybersecurity news outlet The Record reported that, last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered US Cyber Command to stop all cyber operational planning against Russia, including offensive digital campaigns.\n\nEight days have passed since the cryptocurrency exchange ByBit revealed that hackers stole $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum-based assets from the company, a heist that is by some measures the biggest theft of crypto in history. Now the race is on to track the stolen funds across blockchains, prevent its liquidation, or even recover it\u2014and that race is being propelled by $140 million in bounties offered by ByBit itself. ByBit earlier this week launched a website where it\u2019s inviting crypto sleuths to submit tips about the destination of its stolen Ethereum funds and offering as a reward 5 percent of the value of any funds that those tracers can identify and help to freeze or seize. ByBit has offered another 5 percent of the value as a separate reward for any crypto exchange or other platform that obtains the funds.\n\nAs of Friday, the website counted a dozen bounty hunters currently registered as part of that crypto-tracing effort and put the tally of paid-out rewards at around $4.3 million. The site also includes a leaderboard of tracers who have successfully identified tranches of the funds by following them across blockchains or frozen funds\u2014as well as a list of crypto exchanges who have, by contrast, liquidated the stolen funds on behalf of the thieves. So far only one exchange, known as eXch, has been flagged as liquidating $94 million of the stolen assets. ByBit notes that eXch has refused to respond to its messages, and the exchange didn\u2019t respond to a BBC request for comment.\n\nEarlier this week, the FBI took the unusual step of publicly identifying the hackers behind that massive ByBit hack: TraderTraitor, a group of state-sponsored cybercriminals working on behalf of the North Korean government. The FBI asked the crypto industry not to launder the funds of those hackers, a part of the larger umbrella group widely known as Lazarus that has long plagued the cryptocurrency world and has stolen billions in both crypto and non-crypto assets. In its alert, the bureau also released a list of Ethereum addresses associated with the stolen funds in an effort to help the crypto industry identify and seize any part of the $1.4 billion before it can be cashed out. Crypto tracing firm TRM Labs wrote in a post Thursday that around $400 million of the funds have already been moved and may have been successfully liquidated.\n\nIn July, an entity calling itself \u201cNullBulge\u201d published a 1.1-TB trove of data stolen from Disney's internal Slack archive, tipping off a frenzied cleanup effort as Disney rushed to get a handle on leaked revenue numbers, employee information like passport numbers, and sensitive customer information. The breach occurred after a Disney employee, Matthew Van Andel, inadvertently downloaded malware onto his personal computer that collected his login credentials for a number of services, including, crucially, the password to his 1Password credential vault. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to convey the sense of violation,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal. Van Andel also had his credit card numbers and other personal data stolen, and then lost his job as well when a Disney audit of his work computer alleged that he had accessed porn from the device. Van Andel denies the accusation. The episode is just one in a series of breaches where malware that infects a worker\u2019s personal computer can have major ramifications for the institution that employs them.\n\nMattia Ferrari, an Italian priest who works with a migrant-rescue group and has a close relationship with the Pope, revealed this week that he received a warning from Meta that his phone had been hacked with sophisticated spyware from Israeli-based Paragon. The news follows revelations that Luca Casarini, the founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, where Ferrari served as a chaplain, also had his phone compromised by spyware, as did Italian investigative reporter Francesco Cancellato. The string of spyware infections targeting Italian activists and a journalist raises the question of who might be carrying out the hacking operations, with opposition leaders calling on the administration of Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni to address the issue. Meloni\u2019s government has denied being behind the hacking incidents. Pope Francis, who is currently in critical condition with pneumonia, has mentioned speaking to Ferrari on the phone during a TV interview in January, raising the question of whether the spies who hacked Ferrari\u2019s phone eavesdropped on a conversation with the pope himself.",

                "text": "The plea for help arrived last summer. \u201cI am in Myanmar and work for a fraud company,\u201d a Chinese human-trafficking victim wrote in a short email sent from within the Tai Chang scam compound. Like thousands of others in the region, they were promised legitimate work only to find themselves tricked into modern slavery and forced to scam people online for hours every day. Tai Chang, which backs on to the Myanmar-Thailand border, has been linked to incidents of torture. \u201cI\u2019m not safe, I\u2019m chatting with you secretly,\u201d they said. Despite the risk, their first request wasn\u2019t to be rescued.\n\nTai Chang\u2019s internet connection had recently been cut off from Thailand, the person wrote in the messages to anti-scam group GASO in June 2024. Instead of scamming within the compound grinding to a halt, the organized criminals behind the operation found another way to stay online, they claimed. \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink is installed above all the buildings in the campus where we are now,\u201d the individual wrote. \u201cNow the fraud work is running normally. If the fraud network here is down, we can regain our freedom.\u201d\n\nThose messages soon landed on the desk of Erin West, then deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County, California. West, a longtime advocate for victims of so-called pig butchering and other types of cryptocurrency scams, wrote to a lawyer at SpaceX, the company behind Musk\u2019s high-speed Starlink satellite internet system. Starlink connections appeared to be helping criminals at Tai Chang to \u201cscam Americans\u201d and \u201cfuel their internet needs,\u201d West alleged at the end of July 2024. She offered to share more information to help the company in \u201cdisrupting the work of bad actors.\u201d\n\nSpaceX and Starlink never replied, West claims.\n\nReports of the use of Starlink at Tai Chang are not a one-off\u2014criminals running multibillion-dollar empires across Southeast Asia appear to be widely using the satellite internet network. At least eight scam compounds based around the Myanmar-Thailand border region are using Starlink devices, according to mobile phone connection data reviewed by WIRED. Between November 2024 and the start of February, hundreds of mobile phones logged their locations and use of Starlink at known scam compounds more than 40,000 times, according to the mobile phone data, which was collected by an online advertising industry tool.\n\nThe eight compounds, spread around the Myawaddy region of war-torn Myanmar, likely have installed multiple Starlink devices. Photos of Tai Chang reviewed by WIRED appear to show dozens of white Starlink satellite dishes on a single rooftop, while human rights watchdogs and other experts say that Starlink use at the scam compounds has increased in the past year.\n\n\u201cI believe that SpaceX must have the capacity to stop this problem,\u201d says Rangsiman Rome, an opposition member of the House of Representatives in Thailand who chairs a parliamentary committee on national security and border issues. At the start of February, Rome tagged Musk in a post on X, saying criminals are \u201cexploiting Starlink for massive fraud\u201d at scam compounds in the region. He did not get a reply, he says.",

                "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/67bde7d3ee6254fbc47f5203/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/cloud-security-1834994607.jpg",
                "text": "While working on internet-of-things security in the mid-2010s, Alex Zenla realized something troubling.\n\nUnlike PCs and servers that touted the latest, greatest processors, the puny chips in IoT devices couldn't support the cloud protections other computers were using to keep them siloed and protected. As a result, most embedded devices were attached directly to the local network, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to attack. At the time, Zenla was a prodigious teen, working on IoT platforms and open source, and building community in Minecraft IRC channels. After puzzling over the problem for a few years, she started working on a technology to make it possible for nearly any device to run in its own isolated cloud space, known as a \u201ccontainer.\u201d Now, a decade later, she's one of three female cofounders of a security company that's trying to change how cloud infrastructure shares resources.\n\nKnown as Edera, the company makes cloud workload isolation tech that may sound like a niche tool, but it aims to address a universal security problem when many applications or even multiple customers are using shared cloud infrastructure. Ever-growing AI workloads, for example, rely on GPUs for raw processing power instead of standard CPUs, but these chips have been designed for maximum efficiency and capacity rather than with guardrails to separate and protect different processes. As a result, an attacker that can compromise one region of a system is much more likely to be able to pivot from there and gain more access.\n\n\u201cThese problems are very hard, both on the GPU and the container isolation, but I think people were too wiling to accept trade-offs that were not actually acceptable,\u201d Zenla says.\n\nAfter a $5 million seed round in October, Edera today announced a $15 million series A led by Microsoft's venture fund, M12. The latest in granular funding news is nothing remarkable in itself, but Edera's momentum is notable given the current, muted VC landscape and, particularly, the company's all-female roster of founders, which includes two trans women.\n\nIn the United States and around the world, venture funding for tech startups has always been a boys club with the vast majority of VC dollars going to male founders. Female founders who do get initial backing have a more difficult time raising subsequent rounds than men and face much steeper odds founding another company after one fails. And those headwinds are only getting stronger as the Trump administration in the US and Big Tech mount an assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives meant to raise awareness about these types of realities and foster inclusivity.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the fact that we are a small minority in our industry, and that a lot of the changes that are happening around us are not lifting us up,\u201d says Edera CEO and cofounder Emily Long. \u201cWe take great pride and responsibility in continuing to be in the front on this. Since our founding, I can't tell you how many incredibly technical, talented women have proactively asked us to hire them from large institutions. So you start to see that just by existing and being different, you are showing what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nFor Zenla, Long, and cofounder Ariadne Conill, who has an extensive background in open source software and security, the goal of developing Edera's container isolation technology is to make it easy (at least relatively speaking) for network engineers and IT managers to implement robust guardrails and separation across their systems so an exploited vulnerability in one piece of network equipment or a rogue insider situation won't\u2014and can't\u2014spiral into a disastrous mega-breach.\n\n\u201cPeople have legacy applications in their infrastructure and use end-of-life software; there\u2019s no way to do security and believe that you can always patch every existing vulnerability,\u201d Long says. \u201cBut it inherently creates a pretty large risk profile. And then on top of that, containers were never originally designed to be isolated from each other, so you had to choose between innovation and performance and security, and we don\u2019t want people to have that trade-off anymore.\u201d",

                "text": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers\u2019 arguments and his friends\u2019 appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\n\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn\u2019t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat\u2014quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin \u201chad a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,\u201d one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\n\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America\u2019s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow\u2014one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\n\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It\u2019s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States\u2014and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn\u2019t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\n\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there\u2019s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don\u2019t have to squint too hard to see his scheme\u2014which ultimately netted $93 million\u2014as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It\u2019s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it\u2019s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin\u2019s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged\u2014to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn\u2019t at the very top of Moscow\u2019s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\n\nIllustration: Vartika Sharma\n\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she\u2019s gorgeous in her backless gown; he\u2019s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. \u201cI do not know a more decent person than my husband,\u201d Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\n\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin\u2019s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company\u2019s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the \u201cintroduction of unverified or knowingly false information,\u201d according to one local news report.\n\nKlyushin\u2019s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (\u201cThe company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,\u201d a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow\u2019s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia\u2019s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an \u201ceco-activist\u201d (for planting \u201cseveral spruces in the yard\u201d) and a \u201cpet-lover\u201d (his \u201cfavourite pet is a dog\u201d). \u201cBroad-minded, well-read, educated,\u201d gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin \u201cis like getting a lesson from a guru.\u201d",

                "text": "As the so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to rampage through the United States government by making sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, numerous ongoing lawsuits allege that the group\u2019s access to sensitive data violates the Watergate-inspired Privacy Act of 1974 and that it needs to halt its activity. Meanwhile, DOGE cut staff this week at the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and gained access to CISA\u2019s digital systems after the agency had already frozen its eight-year-old election security initiatives late last week.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology was also bracing this week for roughly 500 staffers to be fired, which could have serious impacts on NIST\u2019s cybersecurity standards and software vulnerability tracking work. And cuts last week at the US Digital Service included the cybersecurity lead for the central Veterans Affairs portal, VA.gov, potentially leaving VA systems and data more vulnerable without someone in his role.\n\nMultiple US government departments are now considering bans on China-made TP-Link routers following recent aggressive Chinese digital espionage campaigns. (The company denies any connection to cyberattacks.) A WIRED investigation found that users of Google\u2019s ad tech can target categories that shouldn\u2019t be available under the company\u2019s policies, including people with chronic diseases or those in debt. Advertisers could also target national security \u201cdecision makers\u201d and people involved in the development of classified defense technology.\n\nGoogle researchers warned this week that hackers tied to Russia have been tricking Ukrainian soldiers with fake QR codes for Signal group invites that exploited a flaw to allow the attackers to spy on target messages. Signal has rolled out updates to stop exploitation. And a WIRED deep dive examines how difficult it can be for even the most connected web users to have nonconsensual intimate images and videos of themselves removed from the web.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nRunning a cryptocurrency exchange is a risky business, as hacking victims like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, FTX, and plenty of others can attest. But never before has a platform for buying and selling crypto lost a 10-figure dollar sum in a single heist. That new record belongs to ByBit, which on Friday revealed that thieves hacked its Ethereum-based holdings. The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic\u2014the largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.\n\nByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a \u201cmusked transaction\u201d\u2014likely a misspelling of \u201cmasked transaction\u201d\u2014to trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. \u201cPlease rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,\u201d Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. \u201cAll withdraws are NORMAL.\u201d Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.\n\nThe theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit\u2019s $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.\n\nThe British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users\u2019 end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it\u2014not even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK\u2019s pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" the company said. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move\u2014and the UK\u2019s push for it\u2014will weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.\n\nThe only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps\u2014malware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim\u2019s movements and communications\u2014is when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims\u2019 information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware\u2019s registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.",

They outlined concerns that Chinese state-sponsored hackers may be able to compromise TP-Link\u2019s routers more easily than other brands and thereby infiltrate US systems, and that TP-Link is subject to Chinese law, meaning it can be forced to hand over sensitive US information by Chinese intelligence officials.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nTP-Link was founded in China in 1996 by two brothers, and TP-Link USA was established in 2008. It wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the Chinese and US wings began to split. The process of moving the 170 subsidiaries and all the related ownership out of Hong Kong and into the United States was delayed by the pandemic, says Barney, but it was divested and restructured by 2024.\n\nTP-Link now has headquarters in California, a branch in Singapore, and manufactures in Vietnam. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures everything except chipsets in-house, according to Barney. \u201cOur entities in China are governed directly by us, our employees badged by us, secured by us, in our own facilities.\u201d He also says TP-Link has shared documentation with investigators and that its factory in Vietnam was audited by US retail partners like Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a Nexus in China,\u201d Barney says. He claims that American rival Netgear uses Chinese ODMs (original device manufacturers) to build its products and that even Apple relies on manufacturing in China. Netgear says its routers are manufactured in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand, not China.\n\nCompetition Concerns\n\nThe WSJ report suggests that TP-Link has a leading 64.9 percent share of the US router market, but TP-Link disputes this. The company claims its share hovered around 20 percent for the last few years, but jumped to a 36.5 percent unit share and a 30.7 percent dollar share in 2024, according to Circana data. But even TP-Link\u2019s lower estimate shows a company in the ascendancy. This dominance has been driven by aggressively low prices and a relatively early roll-out of Wi-Fi 7 routers, perceived by some as a concerted effort to flood the US market.\n\n\u201cTechnology should not be exorbitant,\u201d Barney says. \u201cWe're trying to democratize these products.\u201d\n\nHowever, the wide product range raises questions, with many wondering how TP-Link can profit from routers sold at such low prices compared to the competition. Former CNET reviewer Dong Ngo explores this point on the in-depth router review website, Dong Knows.",

                "text": "In late January, a warning spread through the London-based Facebook group Are We Dating the Same Guy?\u2014but this post wasn\u2019t about a bad date or a cheating ex. A connected network of male-dominated Telegram groups had surfaced, sharing and circulating nonconsensual intimate images of women. Their justification? Retaliation.\n\nOn January 23, users in the AWDTSG Facebook group began warning about hidden Telegram groups. Screenshots and TikTok videos surfaced, revealing public Telegram channels where users were sharing nonconsensual intimate images. Further investigation by WIRED identified additional channels linked to the network. By scraping thousands of messages from these groups, it became possible to analyze their content and the patterns of abuse.\n\nAWDTSG, a sprawling web of over 150 regional forums across Facebook alone, with roughly 3 million members worldwide, was designed by Paola Sanchez in 2022 in New York as a space for women to share warnings about predatory men. But its rapid growth made it a target. Critics argue that the format allows unverified accusations to spiral. Some men have responded with at least three defamation lawsuits filed in recent years against members, administrators, and even Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company. Others took a different route: organized digital harassment.\n\nPrimarily using Telegram group data made available through Telemetr.io, a Telegram analytics tool, WIRED analyzed more than 3,500 messages from a Telegram group linked to a larger misogynistic revenge network. Over 24 hours, WIRED observed users systematically tracking, doxing, and degrading women from AWDTSG, circulating nonconsensual images, phone numbers, usernames, and location data.\n\nFrom January 26 to 27, the chats became a breeding ground for misogynistic, racist, sexual digital abuse of women, with women of color bearing the brunt of the targeted harassment and abuse. Thousands of users encouraged each other to share nonconsensual intimate images, often referred to as \u201crevenge porn,\u201d and requested and circulated women\u2019s phone numbers, usernames, locations, and other personal identifiers.\n\nAs women from AWDTSG began infiltrating the Telegram group, at least one user grew suspicious: \u201cThese lot just tryna get back at us for exposing them.\u201d\n\nWhen women on Facebook tried to alert others of the risk of doxing and leaks of their intimate content, AWDTSG moderators removed their posts. (The group\u2019s moderators did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Meanwhile, men who had previously coordinated through their own Facebook groups like \u201cAre We Dating the Same Girl\u201d shifted their operations in late January to Telegram's more permissive environment. Their message was clear: If they can do it, so can we.\n\n\"In the eyes of some of these men, this is a necessary act of defense against a kind of hostile feminism that they believe is out to ruin their lives,\" says Carl Miller, cofounder of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media and host of the podcast Kill List.\n\nThe dozen Telegram groups that WIRED has identified are part of a broader digital ecosystem often referred to as the manosphere, an online network of forums, influencers, and communities that perpetuate misogynistic ideologies.",

Experts say that when combined with other data, this information could be used to identify and target specific individuals.\n\nDisplay & Video 360 (DV360), one of the dominant marketing platforms offered by the search giant, is offering companies globally the option of targeting devices in the United States based on lists of internet users believed to suffer from chronic illnesses and financial distress, among other categories of personal data that are ostensibly banned under Google\u2019s public policies.\n\nOther lists of American users accessible for a price across the platform raise serious national security concerns, experts say, as they reveal data brokers striving to isolate millions of mobile devices carried by government workers\u2014from US judges and military service members to executive agency staff and employees on Capitol Hill.\n\nFirst reviewed by WIRED, an internal spreadsheet obtained from a US-based data broker shows the DV360 platform currently hosting hundreds if not thousands of restricted or otherwise sensitive \u201caudience segments,\u201d each containing a large tranche of data that points to countless mobile devices and online profiles of people in the US. The segments are generated not by Google, but by DV360 customers who upload them to the system, where others can use them to target ads at specific audiences.\n\nThe data\u2014first obtained by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Ireland's oldest independent human rights body\u2014reveals segments targeting hundreds of millions of device users based exclusively on health conditions, from chronic pain and menopause to, among others, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, arthritis, high cholesterol, and hypertension.\n\n\u201cAs with other demand-side platforms, advertisers are able to upload audience lists to Display & Video 360, based either on their own first-party data or from segment providers,\u201d says Erica Walsh, a Google spokesperson. \u201cOur policies do not permit audience segments to be used based on sensitive information like employment, health conditions, financial status, etc.\u201d\n\nDespite this, numerous segments contained in the data are clearly targeted at households and businesses based purely on data suggesting they\u2019re experiencing financial hardship\u2014aiming, for instance, to help advertisers identify people who are in the process of bankruptcy or burdened by long-term debt.\n\nAllison Bodack, another Google spokesperson, tells WIRED that when the company detects \u201cnon-compliant audience segments, we will take action.\u201d Asked to explain why Google had not detected segments with descriptions such as \u201cIndividuals likely to have a Cardiovascular condition,\u201d or \u201cParents of children likely to have a respiratory disease, like Asthma,\u201d Bodack did not respond.\n\nSegments accessible through DV360 that target Americans with asthma contain at least hundreds of millions of mobile IDs\u2014among them, a list simply titled, \u201cPeople who have asthma.\u201d Hundreds of millions more were found on lists for no other reason than the fact that their users are believed to have diabetes. A vast number of devices and user profiles are spread out across lists that target users determined likely to need specific medications, including some controlled substances, such as Ambien. One list links more than 140 million mobile IDs to opioid usage, suggesting the users need relief from a common \"opioid-induced\" side effect.",

                "text": "For more than a decade now, Russian cyberwarfare has used Ukraine as a test lab for its latest hacking techniques, methods that often target Ukrainians first before they're deployed more broadly. Now Google is warning of a Russian espionage trick that's been used to obtain Ukrainians' messages on the encrypted platform Signal\u2014and one that both Ukrainians and other Signal users worldwide should protect themselves against with a new update to the app.\n\nGoogle's threat intelligence team on Wednesday released a report revealing how multiple hacker groups that serve Russian state interests are targeting Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging tool that has become widely accepted as a standard for private communications and is now often used by Ukrainians, including in the Ukrainian military's battlefield communications. Those Russia-linked groups, which Google has given the working names UNC5792 and UNC4221, are taking advantage of a Signal feature that allows users to join a Signal group by scanning a QR code from their phone. By sending phishing messages to victims, often over Signal itself, both hacker groups have spoofed those group invites in the form of QR codes that instead hide javascript commands that link the victim's phone to a new device\u2014in this case, one in the hands of an eavesdropper who can then read every message the target sends or receives.\n\n\u201cIt looks exactly like a group invite, and everything would function exactly like that, except when you scan it, it links the device out,\u201d says Dan Black, a Google cyberespionage researcher and former NATO analyst. \u201cIt instantly pairs your device with theirs. And all your messages are now, in real time, being delivered over to the threat actor while you're receiving them.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, Google began warning the Signal Foundation that maintains the private communications platform about Russia's use of the QR code phishing technique, and Signal last week finished rolling out an update for iOS and Android designed to counter the trick. The new safeguard warns users when they link a new device and checks with them again at a randomized interval a few hours after that device is added to confirm that they still want to share all messages with it. Signal now also requires a form of authentication such as entering a passcode or using FaceID or TouchID on iOS to add a new linked device.\n\nIn fact, Signal had already been working to update those forms of phishing protections aimed specifically at exploitation of its linked device feature prior to Google's warning, says Signal's senior technologist, Josh Lund. But Google's report about Russia's spying in Ukraine provided an \u201cacute\u201d example of the problem that pushed them to move quickly to protect users, he says.\n\n\u201cWe're really grateful to the Google team for their help in making Signal more resilient to this type of social engineering,\u201d says Lund, using the cybersecurity term for tricks that deceive victims into giving hackers sensitive information or access to their systems.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampages through the US government, its access to sensitive data is alarming federal agencies and Americans who interact with them. In the month since the Trump administration began its purge of federal workers, opponents fighting DOGE in court have been pinning their hopes of stopping the world\u2019s richest man on a 50-year-old law.\n\nIn just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management, government payment data at the Department of the Treasury, data on student loan recipients at the Department of Education, information on disaster victims at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and vast amounts of employment- and workplace-related data at the Department of Labor. White House staffers are even pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to grant DOGE access to US taxpayer records. The acting head of the Social Security Administration recently resigned rather than give DOGE access to her agency\u2019s reams of sensitive personal data.\n\nMore than half a dozen lawsuits are seeking to block DOGE employees from rifling through these vast troves of data. One thing they all have in common: They allege that DOGE\u2019s actions violate the Privacy Act of 1974.\n\nHere\u2019s how a law passed after Watergate could rein in another president whose self-professed zeal for retribution is unnerving constitutional experts.\n\nWhat Is the Privacy Act?\n\nThe Privacy Act is a law that limits how the federal government can collect, use, and share information about US citizens and other people in the United States.\n\nThe law\u2019s core features include letting people access government records about them; letting people correct those records if they contain mistakes; requiring agencies to limit information collection, publish lists of records databases, and protect data from hackers; and restricting how agency employees and third parties can access records.\n\nThose restrictions on accessing data are at the heart of the ongoing DOGE saga.\n\nThe Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing someone\u2019s records\u2014even within the agency\u2014unless that person approves in writing or the agency meets one of the law\u2019s 12 exceptions. Most of the exceptions deal with fairly specific circumstances, such as congressional oversight, law enforcement investigations, court orders, census work, statistical research, and National Archives preservation. But there are also two broad, vague exceptions: Agencies can share records with their own employees who \u201chave a need for the record in the performance of their duties\u201d or with third parties for \u201ca routine use\u201d (defined as one that is \u201ccompatible with the purpose for which [the data] was collected\u201d).\n\nWhy Did Congress Pass the Privacy Act?\n\nPresident Richard Nixon illegally used the powers of the government to investigate, intimidate, and punish his political enemies. He tried to use the IRS to target liberal political groups with audits and scrutiny of their tax exemptions, and he deployed the FBI to spy on and harass his political opponents. After Nixon\u2019s resignation over the Watergate scandal, lawmakers sought to prevent future presidents from weaponizing government power.\n\n\u201cCongress must act before sophisticated new systems of information gathering and retention are developed, and before they produce widespread abuses,\u201d North Carolina Democratic senator Sam Ervin said as he introduced one of the bills that inspired the Privacy Act. \u201cThe peculiarity of new complex technologies is that once they go into operation, it is too late to correct our mistakes or supply our oversight.\u201d",

                "text": "After an opaque and uncertain saga, TikTok went dark on millions of phones across the United States on Saturday evening around 10:30 pm EST. Google Play and Apple\u2019s App Store both pulled the app late Saturday as well. If it was already installed prior to Saturday evening, the app is still there on your phone, but launching it only reveals a pop-up warning about the ban. As the deadline loomed, TikTok users had been bracing for the change and flooding other platforms, including the Chinese social app Xiaohongshu or \u201cRedNote.\u201d But if you\u2019re not quite ready to give up the latest skin-care hacks, budgeting tips, and pet tortoise influencers, there are some options for circumventing the ban and continuing to use the platform.\n\n\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d the app alert reads. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d Other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut and Lemon8, also disappeared from US app stores.\n\nSuch a ban has never existed in the US before, so the technical methods being employed to implement it are still evolving, and circumvention techniques may need to change as well. The law driving the situation, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), doesn\u2019t make it illegal to have TikTok on your phone. And, notably, it also doesn\u2019t say that TikTok itself has to stop the app from working in the US.\n\nNonetheless, the company said in the days before the law took effect that it planned to make the app inaccessible to US users\u2014a level of cooperation and accommodation that the outgoing Biden White House called a \u201cstunt\u201d on Saturday afternoon. Even if TikTok itself had obligations under the law, the Biden White House had signaled that it did not plan to enforce the ban before Trump took office on Monday.\n\nRather than putting the pressure on TikTok, PAFACA requires app stores and cloud hosting services to stop doing anything to \u201cdistribute, maintain or update\u201d TikTok. That puts the pressure on Apple and Google to stop new users from downloading TikTok, as well as infrastructure providers like Oracle to keep new content or software updates from reaching the app\u2019s users. Over time, TikTok would likely degrade and become unusable.\n\nOfficials in India banned TikTok in 2020, and the company also proactively blacked out the app in that case. When Indian users who already had the app installed tried to launch it, a pop-up appeared telling them that they couldn\u2019t access the service.\n\nDevashish Gosain, a network analysis researcher and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, says that in India, TikTok users must remove their Indian SIM card from their phone or use an international SIM card and then run a VPN in order to load content in the app.",

                "text": "In my testing, speeds with TunnelBear were competitive with the other options listed here. One of my favorite parts of TunnelBear is the free trial option, which makes it easy to test-drive it and see what your speeds are like without committing. TunnelBear has fewer geographic server locations than some of our other options, but unless you're traveling abroad or need to get around a specific geo-restriction, that shouldn't matter for most users.\n\nTunnelBear costs $3.33 per month if you buy one year upfront.\n\nThe Fastest VPN\n\nNordVPN has been in our guide for years, though after some bad customer-service incidents we pulled it out to retest. After testing NordVPN over the past six months, and repeatedly asking customer service to solve problems, which they did, I am adding it back to our list of recommendations.\n\nIn 2020 Nord Security merged with Surfshark VPN (recommended above). Both VPNs continue to operate independently, but there is considerable overlap in the services offered. Nord's parent company is based in Panama, which is outside the 14-Eyes Alliance, meaning there's nothing forcing NordVPN to gather user data.\n\nNordVPN has much to recommend about it, perhaps the highlight being speed, especially when it comes to upload speeds, which makes it a popular choice for sharing torrents. I like the built-in ad and tracking blocker in the mobile app, and NordVPN is great for unblocking entertainment sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Max. The NordVPN apps offer a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and it supports multi-hop VPN connections. NordVPN supports a good variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and what the company calls NordLynx, which is based on WireGuard.\n\nNordVPN's track record for privacy is pretty good too. In October 2024, in connection with a criminal investigation, NordVPN received a binding warrant from the Panamanian government to provide user data. The company says \u201cthe only information we were able to provide was payment-related data and confirmation about the existence of the account tied to the email address provided to us by the authorities.\u201d\n\nBest for High-Risk Use Cases\n\nIf you're in a situation where personal security is of the utmost importance, do not rely on a VPN. Use Tor (ideally through Tails) instead. Using the Tor network accomplishes some of the same things as a VPN, but it's different. Tor provides anonymity, meaning no one can figure out who you are, but not necessarily privacy. People still might be able to see what you're doing, they won't know it's you doing it. (VPNs provide privacy because no one can see what you're doing while you're going out of a VPN tunnel, but you don't have anonymity because the VPN provider knows who you are.)\n\nTor is simple to set up. All you need to do is download the Tor browser and it will connect you to the web. Once connected to the Tor network, you can browse the web normally. Except everything will be slower. When using Tor, your request for a website hops around the Tor network, bouncing between servers, before emerging and connecting to the site you want to visit. This makes Tor slow, sometimes incredibly slow, but that's necessary to protect your anonymity. And yes, you can combine a VPN with Tor, though that's somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.\n\nOther VPNs We\u2019ve Tried\n\nExpressVPN: We also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it.\n\nWe also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it. Google One VPN: Google One VPN was part of Google One but is slated to be shut down. We never recommended it\u2014let us not forget that Google has repeatedly been caught collecting data that it said it wasn't collecting, which is not what you want to hear from a VPN provider. Nor do we recommend the VPN that comes with Google Fi or the one available in Pixel phones. If you aren't paying for your VPN, two things will happen: It will either shut down, or you will be the thing being sold. Most of the VPNs we recommend are about $5 per month; real privacy is worth $5 a month.\n\nThere are a lot of VPNs out there, but most are not worth your money. If all you want to do is circumvent some Netflix geographic restrictions, then just about any of them will work (we still suggest sticking with our recommended options, but if you can't be stopped, then carry on). For anything more serious, like actually protecting your privacy and data, learn to use Tor. Yes, it's a little technical, but trust me, it's worth learning how to do if your life, family, and job are at stake.\n\nThe Best Free VPN\n\nAs noted above, ProtonVPN has a free version. It's limited to a single device and there are only three servers to connect to which means it can be slow. There are no logs, no ads, and no other limits. In my testing, it was slower than the paid account, but it does work. Several other VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, here's the details on NordVPN's refund policy.\n\nOther than that, it's worth keeping in mind the adage, \u201cIf you're not paying for it, you are the product.\u201d Do not trust a VPN that isn't taking your money (and don't trust many that are either). The good news is that all the picks above offer free trials, which allow you to evaluate how well each VPN will work in your unique situation and for your needs.",

                "text": "If you're worried about possible expansions of government surveillance and access to your information, or simply want to do some digital purging so you're not saddled with old data, there are a bunch of concrete steps you can take to protect your digital privacy. Just as archeologists study carefully preserved tombs and ancient trash heaps to gain insight into historic communities, your long-forgotten digital footprint could be more revealing and sensitive than you realize. And while you can't control everything\u2014particularly information stolen in breaches or gathered by data brokers\u2014you probably have a digital attic full of old data that you can delete or download and save offline. First stop? Old message histories.\n\nChats are a good place to start your digital decluttering. Their real-time nature makes it easy to forget that if you don't have auto-delete turned on for a chat (or if a platform doesn't offer it), all of those \u201cbe there in 10 minutes,\u201d \u201cwait, what color is this dress???\u201d and \u201cwelp, I have covid\u201d messages are still knocking around years later. If you sent them on an end-to-end encrypted platform like Signal or WhatsApp, they only exist on your device and the devices of the other person or people you were chatting with. That means that for governments or bad actors to read them, they would need direct control of your device\u2014a good level of protection, though not foolproof.\n\nCrucially, though, messages that you sent on regular web apps like Slack, Facebook Messenger for most of its history, and Google Chat/Hangouts/Gchat are sitting on a cloud server somewhere. And while they're probably stored in an encrypted form to protect against theft, the platform itself has the keys to decrypt your data and would be able to comply with government requests for it, no matter how old the information is. Sure, all of those \u201cu up?\"s may not seem significant now, but years and years of chat histories can paint a very detailed picture of your life, associations, political beliefs, and past movements and activity.\n\n\u201cDoing a good digital cleaning from time to time is a great habit, especially with social media and old chat messages,\u201d says Kenn White, security principal at the database developer MongoDB and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. \u201cWho you were five or 10 years ago is probably very different than who you are today, so it's worth asking yourself, \u2018Do I really need those seven-year-old inside jokes and sarcastic posts? Do I need to keep old group chat messages and carry them forward to every new phone I get?\u2019\u201d\n\nSome programs like Apple's Messages make it easy to auto-delete your chat histories after a set period of time. On iOS, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and then scroll and tap Keep Messages. Then choose whether to keep messages forever, for one year, or for 30 days before auto-deleting.\n\nOn the free version of Slack, data older than a year is automatically deleted. The company keeps data forever on paid plans, unless the administrator sets up rolling deletion. This is useful if you have an active Slack with your friends, but most people who use Slack at work don't make decisions about administrative policies and can't control deletion. Keep this in mind for any communication you do on an employer's platforms. You may be able to go through and delete messages or files one by one, but you likely won't have the access to make policy decisions about automatic or batch deletion.",

If you own a more recent smartphone from Apple, you might be able to use precision location data to find the hidden device.\n\nMonths after the release of the AirTag, Apple launched the Tracker Detect app for Android phones, where users had to initiate the scan. Google and Apple since have continued working together to make it easier for Android phones to detect unwanted AirTag trackers and for Apple phones to spot Android trackers. Recently, Google rolled out automatic smartphone alerts for unknown Bluetooth trackers, similar to what iPhone owners receive for AirTags.\n\nPhotograph: Google\n\nWhile some guides to finding AirTags recommend using Bluetooth scanners, Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation does not consider this method to be reliable for tracker searching. \u201cI have tried using various Bluetooth scanners in order to detect AirTags, and they do not work all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nMillions of Americans still do not own a smartphone. Without a device on hand, you must rely on visual and audible clues to find any hidden AirTags. The circular white disc is slightly larger than a quarter. As reported by The New York Times, Ashley Estrada discovered an AirTag lodged under her license plate, and her video documenting the incident was viewed more than 22 million times on TikTok.\n\nWhen the AirTag was first released, the tracker would emit a beeping noise if away from the owner for longer than three days. Apple has since shortened the time to 24 hours or less. Despite the update, you might not want to rely only on sound to detect AirTags. Numerous videos on YouTube offer DIY instructions to disable the speaker, and noiseless versions of the trackers were even listed for a short time on Etsy.\n\nWhat if I Find One?\n\nThe best way to disable an AirTag is to remove the battery. To do this, flip the AirTag so the metallic side with an Apple logo is facing you. Press down on the logo and turn counterclockwise. Now you will be able to remove the cover and pop out that battery.\n\nApple\u2019s support page for the AirTag suggests reaching out to the police if you believe you are in a dangerous situation. \u201cIf you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement, who can work with Apple to request information related to the item,\u201d the support page reads. \u201cYou might need to provide the AirTag, set of AirPods, Find My network accessory, and the device's serial number.\u201d One way to figure out the serial number is to hold the top of an iPhone or other near-field-communication-enabled smartphone to the white side of an AirTag. A website with the serial number will pop up.",

                "text": "A Bangladeshi worker was eager to get started at their new OpenAI job\u2014completing basic online tasks in exchange for consistent income, while getting into cryptocurrency investing at the same time. After connecting with the startup on Telegram and creating an account through a ChatGPT-branded app, they invested crypto into the platform and began a months-long job working for \u201cAiden\u201d from \u201cOpenAI.\u201d\n\nThe work was performed through the website \u201cOpenAi-etc,\u201d and internal conversations were held on Telegram. It was simple: Invest some crypto, complete a few tasks, and earn daily profits based on what was invested.\n\nOver the course of this worker\u2019s time with the company, mentors continuously encouraged them to invest more money into the fund and recruit more Bangladeshi people to the team. When the worker convinced over 150 to join and the mentors split the growing team of \u201cbrokers\u201d into a hierarchy based on seniority, it all felt very real. The total crypto-investment fund for their team was around $50,000. After a devastating cyclone hit Bangladesh in May, company leaders supposedly helped those in need, further earning the trust of employees.\n\nAll seemed well until the morning of August 29, 2024, when everyone woke up to find that the website, all of their money, Aiden, and the other fake OpenAI employees had vanished overnight. The job, of course, was never with OpenAI at all, former workers say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen similar scams where, at the beginning, you think you are making profit, and then basically you invest more and more,\u201d says Shirin Nilizadeh, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Arlington who focuses on security and privacy. \u201cThen, suddenly, you lose everything.\u201d.\n\nThe story of the scammed \u201cOpenAI\u201d worker is from just one of 11 complaints about OpenAi-etc submitted to the US Federal Trade Commission by workers from Bangladesh last year, seven of which mention \u201cAiden.\u201d Analysis of the complaints, obtained by WIRED through a public records request, reveal a potentially widespread job scam that used OpenAI\u2019s name recognition to allegedly trick low-wage workers out of their savings. While some people describe getting started with OpenAi-etc in June or July, others believed they were working for the company for around six months.\n\nThe first FTC complaint obtained by WIRED, lodged over two months before the August 29 rug pull, says the complainant was invited by OpenAi-etc to invest around $170 in crypto. The person mentions an American registration number for the business, confirming it was in good standing with Colorado regulators and listing a physical office in Denver. The complaint also highlights a legitimate-looking money service business registered with the US Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which lists the company\u2019s location as an office inside the Empire State Building in New York City.\n\nA WIRED review of domain name system records for the now-defunct OpenAi-etc website shows that it appears to have been hosted by a China-based web hosting company.\n\nJay Mayfield, a senior public affairs specialist at the FTC, declined WIRED\u2019s request to confirm whether the group is looking into OpenAi-etc, saying that investigations are nonpublic. Mayfield did not answer additional questions about what steps the FTC is taking to prevent similar scams or provide better assistance for international victims.",

So when DOGE terminated Jonathan Kamens in its agency purge, it may not have fully grasped that it was firing the security lead for the Department of Veterans Affairs website\u2014the digital hub that connects veterans with their benefits and hosts sensitive personal data, including medical records.\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former VA sources, along with veterans who now work in private-sector cybersecurity, indicate that Kamens\u2019 firing could have disastrous privacy consequences for millions of US veterans.\n\n\u201cI believe that his abrupt firing puts the security of veterans services at risk,\u201d one source with knowledge of VA systems, who was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, told WIRED about Kamens. \u201cEliminating the person responsible for the security of veteran information on VA.gov erodes the quality of the service for the veteran. It\u2019s reckless.\u201d\n\nVA.gov is what Kamens calls \u201cthe front door\u201d for all VA benefits. The site served more than 20 million registered users in the past 12 months, resulting in more than 53 million transactions. Veterans go there to access, among other things, financial, educational, health care, and death benefits. In other words, VA digital services are not only central to the lives of many veterans and their families but also a repository of deeply private information about their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that the cybersecurity practice within VA.gov is going to suffer and that they are going to fall behind on what they are required to do in order to keep cybersecurity on VA.gov where it needs to be,\u201d Kamens says. \u201cAnd the result of that is it\u2019s going to get worse, and eventually it will get bad enough that there will be an incident.\u201d\n\nKamens was not the only person working on VA digital security and was far from the only person there who cares about safeguarding veterans' personal data. But he served a vital role in a large and important government apparatus that is notoriously strapped for resources. In particular, Kamens says, he was the only staffer working full-time on VA.gov cybersecurity and, therefore, the point person for overseeing protective upgrades and services from third-party security vendors.\n\n\u201cThis is sensitive data that in the wrong hands can do harm to people,\u201d Kamens says. \u201cThere was always too much work to do and not enough people to do it, and now all of a sudden I\u2019m gone. DOGE is all about efficiency, and that is not going to make VA more efficient.\u201d\n\nThe VA did not comment in response to WIRED's questions about changes in the cybersecurity staffing for VA.gov. In addition to cuts at USDS, more than 1,000 workers were fired from the VA itself last week. \u201cPresident Trump's looking for efficiencies so that we can do our job better,\" said secretary of veterans affairs Doug Collins in a video statement on Thursday. \u201cWhen you're doing things, you're making moves, you're making good moves, motion causes friction.\u201d",

The fears were heightened last week when some NIST workers witnessed a handful of people they believed to be associated with DOGE inside Building 225, which houses the NIST Information Technology Laboratory at the agency\u2019s Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, according to multiple people briefed on the sightings. The DOGE staff were seeking access to NIST\u2019s IT systems, one of the people said.\n\nSoon after the purported visit, NIST leadership told employees that DOGE staffers were not currently on campus, but that office space and technology were being provisioned for them, according to the same people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Axios and Bloomberg reported that NIST had begun informing some employees that they could soon be laid off. About 500 recent hires who are still in probationary status and can be let go more easily were among those expected to be affected, according to the reports. Three sources tell WIRED that the cuts likely impact lauded technical experts in leadership positions, including three lab directors who were promoted within the last year. One person familiar with the agency tells WIRED that the official layoff notices may come Friday.\n\nThe White House and a spokesperson for NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce, did not yet return requests for comment.\n\nOne NIST team that has been fearing cuts because of its number of probationary employees is the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created after former President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI issued in October 2023. Trump rescinded the order shortly after taking office last month, describing it as a \u201cbarrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe AI Safety Institute and its roughly two dozen staffers have been working closely with AI companies, including rivals to Musk\u2019s startup xAI like OpenAI and Anthropic, to understand and test the capabilities of their most powerful models. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI and is currently suing the startup over its decision to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.\n\nAISI\u2019s inaugural director, Elizabeth Kelly, announced she was leaving her role earlier this month. Several other high-profile NIST leaders working on AI have also departed in recent weeks, including Reva Schwartz, who led NIST\u2019s Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI program, and Elham Tabassi, NIST\u2019s chief AI adviser. Kelly and Schwartz declined to comment. Tabassi did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at wak.01, peard33.24, and leahfeiger.86.\n\nUS vice president JD Vance recently signaled the new administration\u2019s intent to deprioritize AI safety at the AI Action Summit, a major international meeting held in Paris last week that AISI and other government staffers were not invited to attend, according to three familiar with the matter. \u201cI'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,\u201d Vance said in his first major speech as VP. \u201cI'm here to talk about AI opportunity.\u201d",

That brings the total number of US telecommunications networks breached by Salt Typhoon to at least 11.\n\nRussia\u2019s notorious Sandworm hacking unit may be best known for its attacks on Ukraine, including multiple blackouts caused by its cyberattacks and its release of the destructive NotPetya malware. However, a hacking group within Sandworm is now taking aim at targets in Western nations, including Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, according to research released this week by Microsoft. The group, which Microsoft calls BadPilot, is known as an \u201cinitial access operation,\u201d breaching targets for the purpose of handing over access to those systems to other Sandworm hackers.\n\nMeanwhile, we dug into the slimy world of romance scammers who are making ill-gotten fortunes by capitalizing on the loneliness epidemic, and we dipped into the opaqueness of online advertising data that could pose a threat to US national security. Finally, we found that US funding cuts under the new Trump administration are hurting the organizations protecting children from exploitation, abuse, and human trafficking.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE finally started publishing some information about its activities on its threadbare website this week. But it wasn\u2019t the only entity publishing on the site.\n\nTwo web developers, working independently, found that it is possible to push updates to the DOGE.gov domain, which claims to be an official US government website. The website uses a database that can be edited by anyone online, the experts told 404Media. To demonstrate the insecurity, they left a couple of messages on the DOGE site: \u201cThis is a joke of a .gov site,\u201d one read, while the other says: \u201cTHESE \u2018EXPERTS\u2019 LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.\u201d\n\nThe messages stayed on the website for at least 12 hours and remained visible for some time on Friday. The DOGE website was launched in January and until this week was a single landing page containing very little information. The web experts who discovered the vulnerabilities told 404Media that the website appeared to have been \u201cslapped together.\u201d\n\nThe website only started being populated this week\u2014with some figures purporting to show the size of the US government\u2014after Musk promised his organization would be \u201cmaximally transparent.\u201d That transparency may have gone a step too far, however, with HuffPost reporting on Friday that the site included classified material.",

                "text": "Breeze Liu\u2019s online nightmare started with a phone call. In April 2020, a college classmate rang Liu, then 24 years old, to tell her an explicit video of her was on PornHub under the title \u201cKorean teen.\u201d Liu alleges it had been filmed without her permission when she was 17 and uploaded without her consent.\n\nOver time, the video mushroomed and multiplied: it was saved, posted on other porn websites and, Liu claims, used to create intimate deepfake videos that spread across the web. The impact on Liu was profound. \u201cI honestly had to struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I almost killed myself,\u201d she says.\n\nWiping around 400 nonconsensual images and videos from the web would require a multiyear, intercontinental effort. During this time, Liu went from working as a venture capitalist to starting her own company to help fight digital abuse. But when dealing with her own content, the entrepreneur faced a wall of silence and continual delays from one of the internet\u2019s biggest gatekeepers: Microsoft.\n\nAs images and videos are published on websites like PornHub, they\u2019re often hosted on cloud infrastructure. A series of emails related to Liu\u2019s case reviewed by WIRED, plus interviews with a French victims\u2019 aid organization and other advocates working with her, show how Microsoft, despite repeated pleas, did not remove about 150 explicit images of Liu stored on its Azure cloud services. While other companies took down hundreds of images, Liu and a colleague say Microsoft only took action after the two confronted a senior member of the tech giant\u2019s safety team at a content moderation conference.\n\nThe drawn-out process, which prolonged the emotional toll on Liu, provides a detailed illustration of the difficulties victims and survivors of intimate image abuse experience in trying to erase the content from the web. Liu\u2019s ordeal also highlights the void some victims fall into when their age in the imagery is disputed or hard to discern, an overlooked problem that may become more pressing as nudify apps spread in high schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for ordinary people to navigate the complex system and do damage control,\u201d Liu says. While she has shared parts of her struggle before, many of the details in this story and the resolution of Microsoft\u2019s prolonged failure to remove the intimate images have not been previously reported. \u201cWe\u2019re facing an extremely broken system, and this is a global issue,\u201d Liu says. \u201cThis is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nCourtney Gregoire, Microsoft\u2019s chief digital safety officer, says the company has learned from miscommunications in Liu\u2019s case and doesn\u2019t want anyone to go through the agonizing experience she did. \u201cThis content is a priority area where we endeavor to be actioning within 12 hours,\u201d Gregoire says. For Liu, the grueling process took eight months.\n\nAfter being alerted to the first nonconsensual video of her online in April 2020, Liu says, it took her a whole day to calm down. On May 14 of that year, she contacted the Berkeley Police Department, where she lived in California at the time.",

He is joined by another member of the DOGE team, 38-year-old software engineer Kyle Schutt, who is now also on the CISA staff, according to a government source.\n\nCISA referred WIRED to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), of which it\u2019s a component agency, when reached for comment. DHS did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nCoristine\u2014briefly an intern for Musk\u2019s brain-computer interface company Neuralink, as WIRED has reported\u2014has been working his way through numerous federal agencies and departments as a DOGE operative since January. He has been tracked at the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management, the State Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. At State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Technology, he potentially had access to systems containing sensitive information about diplomats and many sources around the world who provide the US government with intelligence and expertise.\n\nAs the journalist Marisa Kabas was first to report, he has now moved to CISA, a division of DHS. He is listed in the staff directory as a senior adviser.\n\nA second DOGE worker, Schutt, has also joined Coristine at CISA. Schutt has reportedly also been at the GSA. Prior to his work with DOGE, he worked on the launch of WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republicans that helped the party raise $1.8 billion during the 2024 election campaigns.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what level of access Coristine might have to data and networks at CISA, but the agency, which is responsible for the defense of civilian federal government networks and works closely with critical infrastructure owners around the country, stores a lot of sensitive and critical security information on its networks. This includes information about software vulnerabilities, breaches, and network risk assessments conducted for local and state election offices. Since 2018, CISA has helped state and local election offices around the country assess vulnerabilities in their networks and help secure them. CISA also works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency to notify victims of breaches and process information about software vulnerabilities before the information becomes public.\n\nGot a Tip?

Coristine has not been associated with the Snowflake breaches, but as WIRED has reported, an account that has been associated with him did appear to suggest the owner of the account was seeking help to conduct a distributed denial-of-service attack\u2014a criminal technique that involves launching extensive traffic at a domain to disable it and prevent legitimate traffic from reaching it. Krebs also reported that Path had fired Coristine for allegedly leaking internal company documents to a competitor.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Coristine had been assigned to the DHS as a senior adviser but didn\u2019t indicate what part of the sprawling agency he had joined.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of fighting cybercrime if we\u2019re just going to give access for government networks to people with cybercriminal gang affiliations?\u201d says a cybersecurity researcher who tracks cybercriminal groups.",

                "text": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has frozen all of its election security work and is reviewing everything it has done to help state and local officials secure their elections for the past eight years, WIRED has learned. The move represents the first major example of the country\u2019s cyberdefense agency accommodating President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud and online censorship.\n\nIn a memo sent Friday to all CISA employees and obtained by WIRED, CISA\u2019s acting director, Bridget Bean, said she was ordering \u201ca review and assessment\u201d of every position at the agency related to election security and countering mis- and disinformation, \u201cas well as every election security and [mis-, dis-, and malinformation] product, activity, service, and program that has been carried out\u201d since the federal government designated election systems as critical infrastructure in 2017.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at ericgeller.01.\n\n\u201cCISA will pause all elections security activities until the completion of this review,\u201d Bean added. The agency is also cutting off funding for these activities at the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center, a group funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that has served as a coordinating body for the elections community.\n\nIn her memo, Bean confirmed that CISA had, as first reported by Politico, placed employees \u201cinitially identified to be associated with the elections security activities and the MDM program\u201d on administrative leave on February 7.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\u201d she told employees in the memo.\n\nWhile Bean is temporarily leading CISA, she is officially the agency\u2019s executive director, its top career position. CISA\u2019s first director created the executive-director role to provide continuity during political transitions. Previously, Bean was a Trump appointee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during his first term.\n\nIn justifying CISA\u2019s internal review, which will conclude on March 6, Bean pointed to Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order on \u201cending federal censorship.\u201d Conservatives have argued that CISA censored their speech by coordinating with tech companies to identify online misinformation in 2020, during the final year of Trump\u2019s first term. CISA has denied conducting any censorship, and the US Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit over the government\u2019s work. But in the wake of the backlash, CISA halted most conversations with tech platforms about online mis- and disinformation.\n\nCISA and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince 2017, state and local election officials have relied on CISA\u2019s expertise and resources\u2014as well as its partnerships with other agencies\u2014to improve their physical and digital security. Through on-site consultations and online guidance, CISA has helped election administrators secure voting infrastructure against hackers, harden polling places against active shooters, and create polling-place backup plans to deal with ballot shortages or power outages.\n\nElection supervisors have always struggled to overcome serious funding challenges, but in recent years, their jobs have become even more stressful as intense voter scrutiny has given way to harassment and even death threats. Election officials of both parties have repeatedly praised CISA for its apolitical support of their work, saying the agency\u2019s recommendations and free security services have been critical in boosting their own efforts.",

                "text": "Loneliness has never been more urgent. On top of the significant mental health concerns, the idea that people are now lonelier and having fewer social interactions is fueling very real threats to security. Foremost among these is one of today\u2019s most pernicious digital frauds: romance scams, which exploit targets\u2019 feelings of isolation and net fraudsters hundreds of millions of dollars per year. As scammers increasingly organize their workflows and incorporate new AI technologies, it\u2019s becoming possible for them to deploy these scams at an even more vast scale.\n\nRomance scams, also known as confidence scams, are extremely communication-intensive. They require attackers to build relationships with their targets via dating apps and social media. So while generative AI chatbots are already being used to write scripts and converse in multiple languages for other types of fraud, they can\u2019t quite pull off these romance scams on their own. But with the vulnerable population growing, researchers believe there is real potential for automation to provide a boon to scammers.\n\n\u201cThese frauds are growing into a more organized form,\u201d says Fangzhou Wang, an assistant professor researching cybercrime at the University of Texas at Arlington. \u201cThey are hiring individuals from all over the world, meaning that they can target all different kinds of victims. Everybody is using dating apps and social media. There are all these opportunities that give fraudsters fertile ground.\u201d\n\nRomance fraud is already big business for scammers. People in the US have reported losses of nearly $4.5 billion to romance and confidence fraud over the past decade, according to an analysis of the last 10 years of data from the FBI\u2019s annual internet crime reports. (The most recent data available encompasses up to the end of 2023.) According to the FBI\u2019s figures, romance and confidence scams have led to losses of around $600 million for each of the past five years\u2014except for 2021, when losses peaked at almost $1 billion. Some estimates are even higher. And while there has been some decrease in the amount of money lost to romance scammers in recent years, there has been a rise in so-called pig butchering fraud, which often contains elements of confidence scams.\n\nWIRED went looking for love and found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible.\n\nRomance scams begin all over the internet, from criminals blasting out messages on Facebook to hundreds of victims at a time, to others matching with every profile they see on dating apps. A variety of criminals run romance scams, from \u201cYahoo Boys\u201d in West Africa to giant scam compounds in Southeast Asia. However, once a criminal has made contact with a potential victim, they all follow an eerily similar playbook to build emotional attachment with those they are attempting to defraud.\n\n\u201cRomance fraud is the most devastating fraud to be a victim of, bar none,\u201d says Elisabeth Carter, an associate professor of criminology at Kingston University London, who has extensively studied these scams and their impacts on people.\n\nOnline dating has taken years to integrate into mainstream conceptions of relationships and love, but it is now the norm. As generative AI chatbots have found their way onto scores of smartphones, they have quickly become yet another digital avenue for romance and connection. While it would be difficult with current technology to farm out a romance scam to a chatbot entirely, the potential is clearly there for attackers to use generative AI for creating scam scripts and helping fill in content for more and more chats that are all running simultaneously, even in multiple languages.",

                "text": "When the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon was revealed last fall to have deeply penetrated major US telecommunications companies\u2014ultimately breaching no fewer than nine of the phone carriers and accessing Americans' texts and calls in real time\u2014that hacking campaign was treated as a four-alarm fire by the US government. Yet even after those hackers' high-profile exposure, they've continued their spree of breaking into telecom networks worldwide, including more in the US.\n\nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future on Wednesday night revealed in a report that they've seen Salt Typhoon breach five telecoms and internet service providers around the world, as well as more than a dozen universities from Utah to Vietnam, all between December and January. The telecoms include one US internet service provider and telecom firm and another US-based subsidiary of a UK telecom, according to the company's analysts, though they declined to name those victims to WIRED.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super active, and they continue to be super active,\u201d says Levi Gundert, who leads Recorded Future's research team known as Insikt Group. \u201cI think there's just a general under-appreciation for how aggressive they are being in turning telecommunications networks into Swiss cheese.\u201d\n\nTo carry out this latest campaign of intrusions, Salt Typhoon\u2014which Recorded Future tracks under its own name, RedMike, rather than the Typhoon handle created by Microsoft\u2014has targeted the internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco's IOS software, which runs on the networking giant's routers and switches. The hackers exploited two different vulnerabilities in those devices' code, one of which grants initial access, and another that provides root privileges, giving the hackers full control of an often powerful piece of equipment with access to a victim's network.\n\n\u201cAny time you're embedded in communication networks on infrastructure like routers, you have the keys to the kingdom in what you're able to access and observe and exfiltrate,\u201d Gundert says.\n\nRecorded Future found more than 12,000 Cisco devices whose web interfaces were exposed online, and says that the hackers targeted more than a thousand of those devices installed in networks worldwide. Of those, they appear to have focused on a smaller subset of telecoms and university networks whose Cisco devices they successfully exploited. For those selected targets, Salt Typhoon configured the hacked Cisco devices to connect to the hackers' own command-and-control servers via generic routing encapsulation, or GRE tunnels\u2014a protocol used to set up private communications channels\u2014then used those connections to maintain their access and steal data.\n\nWhen WIRED reached out to Cisco for comment, the company pointed to a security advisory it published about vulnerabilities in the web interface of its IOS software in 2023. \u201cWe continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in a statement.\n\nHacking network appliances as entry points to target victims\u2014often by exploiting known vulnerabilities that device owners have failed to patch\u2014has become standard operating procedure for Salt Typhoon and other Chinese hacking groups. That's in part because those network devices lack many of the security controls and monitoring software that's been extended to more traditional computing devices like servers and PCs. Recorded Future notes in its report that sophisticated Chinese espionage teams have targeted those vulnerable network appliances as a primary intrusion technique for at least five years.",

                "text": "Over the last decade, the Kremlin's most aggressive cyberwar unit, known as Sandworm, has focused its hacking campaigns on tormenting Ukraine, even more so since Russian president Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbor. Now Microsoft is warning that a team within that notorious hacking group has shifted its targeting, indiscriminately working to breach networks worldwide\u2014and, in the last year, has seemed to show a particular interest in networks in English-speaking Western countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's threat intelligence team published new research into a group within Sandworm that the company\u2019s analysts are calling BadPilot. Microsoft describes the team as an \u201cinitial access operation\u201d focused on breaching and gaining a foothold in victim networks before handing off that access to other hackers within Sandworm\u2019s larger organization, which security researchers have for years identified as a unit of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. After BadPilot's initial breaches, other Sandworm hackers have used its intrusions to move within victim networks and carry out effects such as stealing information or launching cyberattacks, Microsoft says.\n\nMicrosoft describes BadPilot as initiating a high volume of intrusion attempts, casting a wide net and then sorting through the results to focus on particular victims. Over the last three years, the company says, the geography of the group's targeting has evolved: In 2022, it set its sights almost entirely on Ukraine, then broadened its hacking in 2023 to networks worldwide, and then shifted again in 2024 to home in on victims in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.\n\n\u201cWe see them spraying out their attempts at initial access, seeing what comes back, and then focusing on the targets they like,\u201d says Sherrod DeGrippo, Microsoft\u2019s director of threat intelligence strategy. \u201cThey\u2019re picking and choosing what makes sense to focus on. And they are focusing on those Western countries.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft didn't name any specific victims of BadPilot's intrusions, but broadly stated that the hacker group's targets have included \u201cenergy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing,\u201d and \u201cinternational governments.\u201d On at least three occasions, Microsoft says, its operations have led to data-destroying cyberattacks carried out by Sandworm against Ukrainian targets.\n\nAs for the more recent focus on Western networks, Microsoft's DeGrippo hints that the group's interests have likely been more related to politics. \u201cGlobal elections are probably a reason for that,\u201d DeGrippo says. \u201cThat changing political landscape, I think, is a motivator to change tactics and to change targets.\u201d\n\nOver the more than three years that Microsoft has tracked BadPilot, the group has sought to gain access to victim networks using known but unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-facing software, exploiting hackable flaws in Microsoft Exchange and Outlook, as well as applications from OpenFire, JetBrains, and Zimbra. In its targeting of Western networks over the last year in particular, Microsoft warns that BadPilot has specifically exploited a vulnerability in the remote access tool Connectwise ScreenConnect and Fortinet FortiClient EMS, another application for centrally managing Fortinet's security software on PCs.\n\nAfter exploiting those vulnerabilities, Microsoft found that BadPilot typically installs software that gives it persistent access to a victim machine, often with legitimate remote access tools like Atera Agent or Splashtop Remote Services. In some cases, in a more unique twist, it also sets up a victim's computer to run as so-called onion service on the Tor anonymity network, essentially turning it into a server that communicates via Tor's collection of proxy machines to hide its communications.",

                "text": "Last year, a media investigation revealed that a Florida-based data broker, Datastream Group, was selling highly sensitive location data that tracked United States military and intelligence personnel overseas. At the time, the origin of that data was unknown.\n\nNow, a letter sent to US senator Ron Wyden\u2019s office that was obtained by an international collective of media outlets\u2014including WIRED and 404 Media\u2014claims that the ultimate source of that data was Eskimi, a little-known Lithuanian ad-tech company. Eskimi, meanwhile, denies it had any involvement.\n\nEskimi\u2019s alleged role\u2014and its denials\u2014highlight the opaque nature of the location data industry: A data broker in Florida claims a Lithuanian company provided data on US military personnel in Germany. That data could theoretically be sold to essentially anyone. But the exact ways in which the data is collected, compiled, and shared remains unclear.\n\nThis article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a global insider threat risk, from some unknown advertising companies, and those companies are essentially breaking all these systems by abusing their access and selling this extremely sensitive data to brokers who further sell it to government and private interests,\u201d says Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push, referring to the ad-tech ecosystem broadly.\n\nIn December, the joint investigation by WIRED, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), and Netzpolitik.org analyzed a free sample of location data provided by Datastream. The investigation revealed that Datastream was offering access to precise location data from devices likely belonging to American military and intelligence personnel overseas\u2014including at German airbases believed to store US nuclear weapons. Datastream is a data broker in the location data history, sourcing data from other providers and then selling it to customers. Its website previously said it offered \u201cinternet advertising data coupled with hashed emails, cookies, and mobile location data.\u201d\n\nThat dataset contained 3.6 billion location coordinates, some logged at millisecond intervals, from up to 11 million mobile advertising IDs in Germany over a one-month period. The data was likely collected through SDKs (software development kits) embedded in mobile apps by developers who knowingly integrate tracking tools in exchange for revenue-sharing agreements with data brokers.\n\nFollowing this reporting, Wyden\u2019s office demanded answers from Datastream Group about its role in trafficking the location data of US military personnel. In response, Datastream identified Eskimi as its alleged source, claiming it obtained the data \u201clegitimately from a respected third-party provider, Eskimi.com.\u201d\n\nVytautas Paukstys, CEO of Eskimi, says that \u201cEskimi does not have or have ever had any commercial relationship with Datasys/Datastream Group,\u201d referring to another name that Datastream has used, and that Eskimi \u201cis not a data broker.\u201d A subsequent email from a company spokesperson says, \u201cEskimi does not have any commercial relationship with Datastream Group. Without a doubt, Eskimi did not share or sell location data of military personnel or any other data in Germany or Europe with Datastream group.\u201d\n\nIn an email responding to detailed questions from the reporting collective, M. Seth Lubin, an attorney representing Datastream Group, described the data as lawfully sourced from a third party. While Lubin acknowledged to Wyden that the data was intended for use in digital advertising, he stressed to the reporting collective that it was never intended for resale. Lubin declined to disclose the source of the data, citing a nondisclosure agreement, and dismissed the reporting collective\u2019s analysis as reckless and misleading.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) declined to answer specific questions related to our investigation. However, in December, DOD spokesperson Javan Rasnake said that the Pentagon is aware that geolocation services could put personnel at risk and urged service members to remember their training and adhere strictly to operational security protocols.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ravaged its way though the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), cutting its workforce from 10,000 to just 300, hundreds of organizations providing vital safety services have been upended. Multiple children\u2019s safety groups\u2014including those fighting online child sexual abuse and exploitation\u2014say their efforts have been severely hamstrung.\n\nGroups identifying victims and providing care for those who have been subject to online exploitation or human trafficking are struggling to support the vulnerable children, multiple organizations tell WIRED. Such child safety projects often take place in poorer countries, which can have fewer resources to support victims or investigate crimes. Sources say that funding for safe houses has been paused, potentially exposing victims to more harm, and efforts that identify criminals behind child exploitation have been put on hold.\n\n\u201cIt will be very hard for us to identify the victims,\u201d says Chantal Yelu Mulop, from the Coordination for Youth and the Fight Against Sexual Violence and Trafficking in Persons (CJVFFT), in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the war-torn country faces new fighting and humanitarian crises, children have long been trafficked to work in cobalt mines linked to the production of smartphone and EV batteries.\n\nAs USAID funding was withdrawn over the past week, Mulop says her organization had just started helping around 25 newly identified victims of human trafficking\u2014all of them aged under 17. The group was taken to a support shelter run by another organization. \u201cWhen we bring them there, USAID was ready to help. A few hours later they cancel,\u201d Mulop says. \u201cThere\u2019s no food, no nothing that we can provide to them,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile the USAID cuts have been immediate, global child protection projects have also faced a funding pause from the State Department. This foreign aid \u201cpause,\u201d issued by the Trump administration, is set to last for at least 90 days. USAID did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. The State Department had not provided a comment by time of publication.\n\nBoth government bodies have provided funding to help countries and people around the world. This includes USAID\u2019s vast swath of health care and education programs\u2014their withdrawal is putting millions of lives at risk and limits tackling the climate crisis. In Southeast Asia, several patients at a migrant camp reportedly died after medical support was removed.\n\nCounter-human-trafficking funding often includes money for projects that help to crack down on online child exploitation and sexual abuse. Funding can be provided to international organizations that coordinate efforts and work with partners, like Mulop\u2019s CJVFFT, on the ground. The funding can directly support victims, as well as providing expertise to officials in countries, and stop more children becoming targets.\n\n\u201cMany of these victims engage with their traffickers through electronic means,\u201d says Jessica Ryckman, the executive director of the nonprofit Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB), which works on trafficking and child exploitation programs and has been impacted by the funding changes. \u201cIt is exploitation that is advanced through digital technology.\u201d",

The exercise was so disastrous that the Pentagon went on to impose arbitrary constraints on the Red team that all but ensured a Blue team victory, prompting Van Riper to quit as team leader in protest.\n\nAs part of its complicated legacy, Millennium Challenge 2002 had undermined the very advanced technologies it sought to validate, proving that a handful of small watercraft could, when deployed in coordinated swarms amid a larger attack, successfully outmaneuver larger surface warships with potentially deadly consequences. It\u2019s a lesson the Pentagon all but ignored by stacking the deck in favor of the Blue team following the Red team\u2019s initial victory. Now, more than two decades later, its lessons are playing out in battlefields around the world.\n\nView of an explosion on a ship that Houthis say is an attack by them on Greek-owned MV Tutor in the Red Sea, dated June 12, 2024, in this screen grab obtained from a video. Photograph: HOUTHI MEDIA CENTRE/Reuters\n\nUnmanned surface vessels (USVs) loaded with explosives and other lethal payloads are proving a fearsome weapon for ostensibly outgunned fighting forces. Amid Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion, the Ukrainian military has successfully driven Moscow\u2019s Black Sea Fleet from its safe harbor in Sevastopol in the annexed Crimean peninsula using a growing fleet of weaponized drone boats that aren\u2019t just successfully targeting other surface vessels, but engaging shore targets with their own organic kamikaze first-person-view drones and knocking Russian aircraft out of the sky with machine guns and surface-to-air missiles. In the Red Sea, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have employed explosive-laden watercraft to lesser effect in response to Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, successfully sinking the Liberia-flagged bulk carrier MV Tutor in June 2024 and consistently disrupting international maritime traffic in the region.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampage through United States federal institutions, WIRED reported extensively this week on DOGE\u2019s members, activity, and digital access to some of the US government's most delicate and critical software systems. One DOGE technologist, 19-year-old high school graduate Edward Coristine, established at least five different companies in the past four years\u2014including Tesla.Sexy LLC\u2014and briefly worked at a network monitoring company that has hired convicted hackers. Experts question whether Coristine, who has gone by the name \u201cBig Balls\u201d online, would pass the background check typically required for access to sensitive US government systems.\n\nMeanwhile, DOGE\u2019s apparent dismantling of USAID coupled with the US State Department's funding freeze have dramatically disrupted efforts to help people escape forced labor camps in Southeast Asia run by criminal scammers.\n\nOutside of US government news, WIRED conducted an investigation into more than 300 cyberattacks in the past five years against US K\u201312 schools and found that victim schools sometimes withhold critical information about the scale and scope of the breaches from impacted students and parents. In slightly better news, data from the cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis shows that ransomware payments fell precipitously in the second half of 2024. Experts fear, though, that the brief reprieve could be short-lived and may not be easy for defenders to sustain.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that Apple has received a secret order from the UK office of the Home Secretary mandating the company to provide a way to access any user data protected by the company\u2019s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. The feature, which debuted at the end of 2022, is designed with end-to-end encryption so only users themselves, not Apple, have access to their data. As a result, complying with the UK demand would require Apple to break the feature by building a backdoor into it. Sources told the Post that rather than install a backdoor, Apple is likely to withdraw support for Advanced Data Protection for iCloud in the UK. \u201cYet that concession would not fulfill the UK demand for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States,\u201d the Post noted.\n\nThe order was issued under the UK\u2019s broad 2016 Investigatory Powers Act. UK law enforcement agencies, not to mention cops in the US and other countries, have championed encryption backdoors for years, and lawmakers have tried at various times to mandate backdoors. The Home Office told the Post in a statement, \u201cWe do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\u201d An Apple spokesperson declined to comment to the Post.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave President Donald Trump a golden pager when the two met in Washington on Tuesday. The gift references a September attack in Lebanon against the militant group Hezbollah in which booby-trapped pagers (and walkie-talkies) detonated in coordinated explosions around the country. The operation killed at least 42 people, including some civilians, and injured at least 4,000 civilians, according to Lebanese officials. The attack has been widely attributed to Israel, but the country has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. At the meeting Trump apparently gave Netanyahu a signed photograph of the two of them, which he signed, \u201cTo Bibi, a great leader!\u201d\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has been notifying dozens of users that their personal information was stolen during a 2023 breach. The company is attributing the attack to Russian state-backed hackers. The stolen data included Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license information, and credit card numbers. The incident began as a system intrusion in May 2023 into HPE\u2019s email mailboxes and Microsoft SharePoint systems. HPE publicly disclosed the incident in January 2024.\n\nThe edtech giant PowerSchool says that at least 16,000 students in the United Kingdom had their data stolen as part of a massive December data breach that may have affected 62 million students and 9.5 million teachers, most of them in the US and Canada. Attackers used compromised credentials to infiltrate the company\u2019s customer support portal and then access user data.\n\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement that students at four UK schools were affected totaling \u201capproximately 16,000 students.\u201d It is not clear if this is the total number of UK victims. The compromised data includes students\u2019 dates of birth, contact information, some medical data, and \u201cother related information.\u201d",

In some cases, any deviations in the manner in which the data is being used may be not only illegal, the ACLU says, but unconstitutional.\n\nDOGE operatives have infiltrated or assumed control of a number of federal agencies that are responsible for managing personnel files on nearly 2 million federal employees, as well as offices that supply the government with a broad range of software and information technology services.\n\nUnauthorized use of sensitive or personally identifiable data as part of an effort to purge the government of ideologically unaligned staff may constitute a violation of federal law. The Privacy Act and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act strictly prohibit, for instance, unauthorized access and use of government personnel data.\n\nIn a letter to members of several congressional oversight committees, ACLU attorneys highlighted DOGE\u2019s access to Treasury systems that handle a \u201cmajority\u201d of federal payments, which includes details on Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and salaries. Citing WIRED reporting from Tuesday, the attorneys note that, in addition to choking off funding to specific agencies or individuals, this grants DOGE access to \u201ctroves of personal information,\u201d including \u201cmillions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances, and personal finances.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys write: \u201cAccess to\u2014and abuse of\u2014that information could harm millions of people. Young engineers, with no experience in human resources, governmental benefits, or legal requirements around privacy have gained unprecedented surveillance over payments to federal employees, Social Security recipients, and small businesses\u2014and with it, control over those payments.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU attorneys stress that, under normal circumstances, these systems would fall under the control of career civil servants with years of training and experience in managing sensitive data, all of whom survived a comprehensive vetting process.\n\nThe group has also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the communications records of identified DOGE personnel, as well as for details of any requests the task force may have made for access to sensitive and personal data at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nOther files the ACLU seeks pertain to DOGE\u2019s plans to deploy artificial intelligence tools across the government, as well as any plans or discussions about how the task force plans to conform to the litany of federal laws safeguarding sensitive financial and medical information, such as the the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nWIRED first reported Thursday that DOGE operatives at the General Services Administration, which manages the US government\u2019s IT infrastructure, had begun pushing to rapidly deploy a homebrew AI chatbot called \u201cGSAi.\u201d A source with knowledge of GSA's prior dealings with AI tells WIRED that the agency launched a pilot program last fall aimed at testing the use of Gemini, a chatbot adapted for Google Workplace.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIt was English FA Cup weekend and a packed schedule of European league football across the continent, so let's dig in.\n\nEngland's cup competition debuted semiautomated offside technology (SAOT), LaLiga's title race took a couple of more significant turns as Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid created further distance from Real Madrid, and the Bundesliga table continued to look make good reading for Bayern Munich fans.\n\nThere were also talking points from Serie A's title chase and the English Championship as Luis Miguel Echegaray, Sam Marsden and Constantin Eckner look across Europe for the big takeaways and highlights from the weekend.\n\nEnglish FA Cup\n\nTop takeaway: Semiautomated technology and egregious challenge take center stage\n\nThis weekend, the FA Cup fifth round became a proverbial guinea pig for SAOT, a system that is already used in the Champions League as well as at FIFA's 2022 World Cup and UEFA's 2024 European Championship. Given that it was the system's English football debut, there was little chance it would pass with no issues, but just how did it go?\n\nFor the most part, it worked well: it was rightly used for the first goal of the weekend in Aston Villa's opener in their 2-0 victory over Cardiff City on Friday night, and also on Sunday after correctly denying a supposed stoppage-time winner from Newcastle United's Fabian Sch\u00e4r against Brighton, which sent the game to extra time. Brighton ended up winning the game, but not before a correct call from SAOT.\n\nThere was also major frustration, specifically from Saturday's match between Bournemouth and Wolves when one particular decision took almost eight minutes, which was eventually confirmed as offside. Per the Football Association, SAOT would never be used in that scenario due to the number of bodies in a tight space around the goalmouth, so it meant that VAR had to revert to the original formula of drawing the lines themselves. This, alongside two handball decisions in the incident, emphasized the obvious delay.\n\nSAOT is important and necessary, but as always, patience is needed when it comes to technology, something that is in short supply.\n\nAnother notable point from the weekend was the horrific challenge on Crystal Palace's Jean-Philippe Mateta, who suffered one of the worst fouls in recent memory when Millwall's goalkeeper Liam Roberts kicked the French striker in the face. Once again, there was confusion from a refereeing standpoint as Michael Oliver, who was only a few feet away from the incident, initially gave Roberts a yellow card. But this is where VAR rightly acted and asked him to take a look at it on the screen, which is when the yellow was changed to a straight red.\n\nMateta was discharged from hospital Saturday evening after being treated for 25 stitches to \"a severe laceration to his left ear,\" as quoted by the club's statement. Sunday, he posted on Instagram: \"I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon and stronger than ever. Well done guys for the great job today.\"\n\nBest match: Bournemouth 1-1 Wolves (Bournemouth win 5-4 on penalties)\n\nThis was an extremely entertaining fixture at Vitality stadium for the right and wrong reasons as Bournemouth earned a place in the quarterfinals of the competition for only the third time in club history.\n\nEvanilson's 30th-minute opener preceded an aforementioned eight-minute VAR decision to determine that their second goal was offside. We also had Matheus Cunha playing the role of hero and villain, with his stunning goal in the 60th minute leveling the match for the visitors before he head-butted Milos Kerkez and was sent off just before the penalty shootout.\n\nThe shootout ended in sudden death -- watch for Dango Ouattara's audacious no-run-up attempt -- and Andoni Iraoala's side celebrated a wild victory. It was a game filled with lots of action ... and a lot of waiting around for a piece of technology that's meant to speed the game up, not slow it down.\n\nBest goal: Robbie Brady vs. Burnley\n\nPreston North End won 3-0 against Burnley in this Lancashire derby FA Cup matchup between Championship teams, earning a place in the last eight of the competition for the first time since 1966. They are now also the only non-Premier League representative. The win was very impressive because the visitors arrived at Deepdale stadium at the back of 12 consecutive clean sheets in the league.\n\nBrady, who used to play for Burnley, ended all of that with a magnificent free kick to open the scoring in the 31st minute. The 33-year-old Republic of Ireland international curled in a beautiful, left-footed attempt from 25 yards, which went over the wall and into the top right corner. It was a magical goal, one Lionel Messi would have been proud of.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Marco Asensio, Aston Villa\n\nNever fall in love with a loanee, they say. Well, it's too late for Aston Villa fans because the former Real Madrid star, presently on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, has started his tenure for Unai Emery's side ever so brightly.\n\nOn Friday night under the lights at Villa Park, Asensio scored a double against Cardiff City, making it four goals in all competitions since arriving in January. His understanding with Villa's other big loanee Marcus Rashford has been evident as the English attacker, on loan from Manchester United, assisted in the Spain international's opening goal, making it a combined seven goal contributions since their respective arrivals.\n\nI don't see Asensio's loan turning into a permanent one this summer (there is no buy option), but I think these next few months can turn into a fruitful relationship between club and player. -- Echegaray\n\nLaLiga\n\nTop takeaway: Real Madrid's miserable form continues\n\nReal Madrid's dodgy league form continued with a 2-1 defeat at Real Betis to leave coach Carlo Ancelotti concerned they could be turned over by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League this midweek. Brahim D\u00edaz gave Madrid an early lead at Betis, but the home side levelled through United States midfielder Johnny Cardoso and won the game thanks to an Isco penalty.\n\nThe defeat means Madrid have now won only once in their last five games.\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that Madrid seemed in control. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's hat trick against Real Valladolid at the end of January moved them four points clear of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the top of the table and 10 ahead of Bar\u00e7a, who had a game in hand. Just five matches later, they now find themselves three adrift of leaders Bar\u00e7a, who prevented 10-man Real Sociedad from registering a single shot as they marched to a 4-0 victory on Sunday. Atl\u00e9tico, after beating Athletic Club, are now two points ahead of Real, who slumped to third.\n\nplay 1:50 Garcia slams Real Madrid for showing 'no conviction' in defeat Luis Garcia criticises Real Madrid's lack of desire in their 2-1 defeat to Real Betis in LaLiga.\n\nAncelotti dubbed the defeat in Seville \"costly,\" conceding his team had played a \"bad game.\" He had no complaints about the result and looking ahead, said he feared a repeat performance will see them lose Tuesday's huge Champions League clash against Atl\u00e9tico.\n\n\"I hope this will wake us up,\" he said. \"It seemed like lately we had been more organised and more compact. But today we weren't able to do that.\"\n\nUmar Sadiq scored an incredible back-heeled 87th-minute equaliser as Valencia snatched a 3-3 draw against Osasuna in an unexpected classic at El Sadar. Osasuna had twice come from behind, with Aimar Oroz netting a brace, to lead 3-2 heading into the final straight. But Sadiq had other ideas, his sublime piece of skill earning him his second goal of the night and Valencia a much-needed point. Los Che remain in the bottom three but recent performances under new coach Carlos Corber\u00e1n have given them hope of survival.\n\nTake your pick from the goals in Rayo Vallecano's 1-1 draw with Sevilla. Right-back Ra\u0163iu, who's drawing interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs, opened the scoring from a full 30 yards with an effort that curled perfectly into the top corner. Dodi Lukebakio's equaliser was decent, too, whipped into the inside netting from wide in the penalty box.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Isco, Real Betis\n\nThere was no muted celebration against his former club as Isco slid on his knees in front of the home supporters after netting the winner for Betis against Madrid. The ex-Madrid midfielder was the star of the show in the win, setting up the opener and then netting the game's decisive goals from the penalty spot. The 32-year-old has been reborn since joining Betis in 2023. -- Marsden\n\nBundesliga\n\nTop takeaway: Leipzig seem baffled in Bundesliga after yet another setback\n\nWhen RB Leipzig lost to Wolfsburg 5-1 in November, sporting director Marcel Sch\u00e4fer was quick to ensure that manager Marco Rose's job was not in danger and that the team would pull through that crisis together. Following Leipzig's 2-1 home loss to Mainz on Saturday, Sch\u00e4fer remained tellingly quiet.\n\nThis season has become a disappointment to the Roten Bullen after a promising start in early months. Not only have Leipzig exited the UEFA Champions League unceremoniously with only one win in eight games, but they have also suffered repeated setbacks in the league, with the defeat at the hands of Mainz being the latest one.\n\nNow, granted, Mainz have become the surprise of the season, as the Jonny Burkardt-led team have upset many opponents and are currently fourth in the Bundesliga standings. It must be bittersweet for Rose to witness Mainz's rise, given that he spent eight years as a player at Mainz, most of these years under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. But Mainz are also a great example of how a strong youth academy can be translated into steady success in the Bundesliga.\n\nMeanwhile, Leipzig can rarely capitalise on their investments into the youth academy and usually buy players from elsewhere. But despite the prominent names in Leipzig's current squad, Rose has had a hard time to make his side play a dominant and reliable style based on ball possession. Instead, Leipzig are constantly vulnerable at the back because they cannot recycle possession as well as they should.\n\nLeipzig's slump could yet cost them a place in next season's Champions League and spell the end of manager Marco Rose's ill-fated tenure. Maja Hitij/Getty Images\n\nAs for the loss to Mainz in what was a duel for the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League spot, Rose argued that an \"energy drop\" was mainly responsible for conceding two goals in the second half. Leipzig beat Wolfsburg in the German Cup on Wednesday thanks to a controversial penalty call.\n\n\"Everyone individually and we as a team have to get a feel for what it means to have 1-0 lead in a straining week like this and to come out [of the dressing room] so that we do not allow anything and instantly adapt to what the opponents offer us,\" Rose said, arguing that too often, players bank on the teammate next to them, which does not work against a \"knife-sharp\" opponent like Mainz.\n\nRose is certainly aware of rumours linking Leipzig to Sebastian Hoene\u00df in the event of a coaching change. The current Stuttgart manager worked for Leipzig's youth academy from 2014 to 2017 and is one of the hottest names in the coaching market. Even though Rose is a Leipzig native and thus a great representative within the local community, he knows only wins will keep him in his seat.\n\nLeverkusen were under considerable pressure to keep the championship race alive after Bayern Munich had beaten Stuttgart on Friday. Even though they faced third-placed Frankfurt, Leverkusen's win on the road was never really in doubt. Frankfurt goalie Kevin Trapp acknowledged after the game that Leverkusen were \"one or two levels above us.\" It was a true masterclass by the Xabi Alonso-led side, who might come short against Bayern this year but at least keeps things somewhat interesting.\n\nBest goal: Michael Olise, Bayern Munich vs. Stuttgart\n\nStuttgart basically gifted Bayern three goals in their encounter Friday, but Bayern played their part in outworking them, as exemplified by their first goal. While Stuttgart played with a high back line, Leroy San\u00e9 was the first to a headed clearance by Kim Min-Jae, and the Germany international found Olise with a beautiful vertical pass. The former Crystal Palace winger escaped Stuttgart's defenders and held his nerves before dispatching past goalkeeper Alexander N\u00fcbel.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Robin Hack, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\n\nGladbach registered an important 3-0 win at Heidenheim, and Hack was the most impressive attacking player in how efficiently he played. While the left winger did not necessarily force one-on-ones constantly, he found pockets of space against Heidenheim's shaky defence and scored two goals. -- Eckner\n\nWhat else you missed this weekend\n\nCoventry City flying under Frank Lampard\n\nOn Saturday, Coventry's Tatsuhiro Sakamoto scored a great goal in the 71st minute to make it 3-2 against Oxford United, helping his side move to fifth place -- and a playoff spot -- in the Championship. It was the club's eighth win in the past nine games and since Lampard's arrival in November, only Leeds United and Sheffield United -- top two in the table -- have earned more points than the Sky Blues.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nLampard's managerial journey has not been an easy one given sackings by Chelsea and Everton, but he does have experience in the Championship, where his first gig as head coach was with Derby County. Lampard took them to a playoff final in 2019 before losing to Aston Villa. Now he's back in the league with another chance of redemption and an opportunity to help Coventry do the improbable, but not impossible, feat of earning promotion to the Premier League. -- Echegaray\n\nInter and Napoli draw ... and Atalanta miss chance to capitalise\n\nSubstitute Philip Billing's first goal for Napoli prevented Internazionale from opening up a four-point lead at the top of Serie A on Saturday. Billing netted in the 87th minute at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium, just eight minutes after coming off the bench, as Italy's top two were forced to share the spoils.\n\nJust a point separated the teams heading into the weekend, with Inter leading the way, and Federico Dimarco's first-half strike looked set to extend Simone Inzaghi's side's advantage in the standings. The goal from Billing, who joined on a loan deal from Bournemouth in January, ensured that was not the case, but Napoli still have work to do if they are to keep up with Inter: Antonio Conte's side is winless in Serie A in their last five games.\n\nJust behind them in the table, Atalanta missed the chance to pounce. A win over Venezia would have drawn them level with Napoli and a point back from Inter, but they were held to a disappointing goalless draw by a team mired in relegation problems. -- Marsden\n\nRangers continue to flounder after managerial change\n\nThe 55-time Scottish champions recently sacked Philippe Clement after what can only be described as an underwhelming campaign. Rangers have essentially no hope of catching Celtic in the Scottish Premiership, even though their eternal rivals aren't necessarily in dominant form this season. Four games before the playoffs start, Rangers find themselves in no-man's land, distraught at the state of their club.\n\nBarry Ferguson, a club legend whose last coaching job was third-division Alloa Athletic in 2022, was hired as a caretaker manager to bring fresh energy to the club and dressing room. But things don't look that bright at the moment, as Rangers lost at home to Motherwell on Saturday. The guests were leading the game 2-0 after 30 minutes and pushed all the air out of Ibrox Stadium. Rangers' goal in the second half was not enough to stage a comeback, with Motherwell defending passionately until the final whistle.\n\nWhile the Glasgow clubs sometimes fly under the radar unless they compete in European competitions, fans should keep an eye on what will happen at Rangers in the coming months. The only chance to redeem their season is to make a run in the UEFA Europa League where they face Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's Fenerbah\u00e7e, who themselves are way behind city rivals Galatasaray in the league. -- Eckner",

But, after City released a video of the 28-year-old running and kicking a ball outside, he hinted at an earlier comeback.\n\n\"The fans must know they are not the only ones who are excited,\" Guardiola said. \"It's been five months or six months. After the international break, could be. But one step at a time. We don't have to make stupid decisions to come from weeks earlier. It's good, but still he's not close to coming back I'd say.\n\n\"But he's touching the ball today in the locker room, making touches with the players. He feels confident, he feels more happy. I could not expect [that he could return] before the end of the season, not even the [Club] World Cup. In the Premier League, maybe it's going to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Guardiola is waiting for news on Nathan Ak\u00e9 after he was substituted at halftime of the 3-1 win over Plymouth Argyle on Saturday.\n\nCity have a free week ahead of their trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday, and Guardiola expects to be without the Dutchman.\n\n\"We'll do the test but he [Ake] struggles sometimes with the feet, probably, it's been like this the whole season, the central defenders,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully, the young ones [Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis], they don't have a lot of stuff in their life, can sustain it and help us.\"",

So I know that in this moment everybody knows everything. I know that and it's really easy -- I was a pundit when I finished my career. I know it's really easy.\n\n\"Our goal is to win the Premier League. Maybe it is not with me.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPep Guardiola has said the ball used in the FA Cup is \"not right\" after his Manchester City team struggled in front of goal during their 3-1 win over Plymouth Argyle on Saturday.\n\nCity had 29 shots against the Championship side, but needed two set-piece goals -- both scored by teenager Nico O'Reilly -- as they fought back from 1-0 down. Kevin De Bruyne sealed the victory with a close-range finish in stoppage time. Of City's 29 shots, only nine were on target with 10 blocked and another 10 going wide.\n\n\"It's difficult to control [the ball],\" Guardiola said. \"For many years, many players and managers say about that. When you lose it [sounds like] you're complaining but the ball is not right. In many years it's happened in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, I know it's a business and they come to agreements. You know how many shots went over the post? Look at other games.\"\n\nAn FA Spokesperson responded to any criticism of the ball used in cup games with the following statement: \"Mitre's Ultimax Pro ball - used in the Emirates FA Cup and all other FA Competitions - has been tested in accordance with FIFA testing. All footballs in the professional game are required to meet the FIFA Quality pro accreditation, and this ball delivers against all of the testing requirements.\n\n\"Alongside Mitre, we understand that preference is subjective, but we're confident that the ball performs well. With over 350 goals scored in the knockout competition so far, it provides an exciting element to such a competitive tournament.\"\n\nMikel Arteta was also critical of the ball used in the Carabao Cup after Arsenal fell to a 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle.\n\nHis team had 23 shots in their semifinal first leg at the Emirates in January but only hit the target with three, prompting the Spaniard to say \"the ball flies a lot.\"\n\nThe ball used in the Carabao Cup is manufactured by Puma and the FA Cup ball is made by Mitre. The Premier League ball is made by Nike and the ball used in the Champions League is made by adidas.\n\n\"I've said it for many years,\" Guardiola said. \"There are things out of our control, I've said my opinion. The ball in the Champions League is exceptional, the ball in the Premier League is exceptional, this one isn't.\"",

Fulham, though, had other ideas and after a 1-1 draw played out over a tense 120 minutes short of any real quality, it was Marco Silva's side that prevailed 4-3 on penalties. Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Joshua Zirkzee missed from the spot as United -- the holders -- crashed out.\n\nThe cup exit closed another door for Amorim and now the pressure on Thursday's trip to San Sebastian has heightened even further. The Europa League offers a trophy and a place in next season's Champions League. Winning it would turn this season into something resembling a success. On the evidence of their performance against Fulham -- which lacked any real cutting edge in key moments -- that's easier said than done.\n\n\"In the end, the penalties can go both ways and today wasn't our way,\" Amorim said. \"We know that we are losing games, but the goal is to win the Premier League again. I don't know how long it will take. We have a goal, and we continue forward no matter what.\n\n\"It's impossible to know, but you start understanding the players are better and we understand the league. We'll see in the future.\"\n\nSometimes he must feel as if he's banging his head against a brick wall. In his programme notes ahead of the game, he paid tribute to his coaching staff for \"improving in how we defend set-pieces in recent weeks.\"\n\nIt was typical of his \"one step forward, two steps back\" start to life at Old Trafford that at the end of one of United's better first halves under his management, Fulham scored from a set piece.\n\nMan United's run as FA Cup holders is over thanks to Sunday's limp defeat on penalties to visiting Fulham. Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images\n\nIt looked like a poor decision to award a corner, but that doesn't excuse the ease at which Rodrigo Muniz flicked it on for Calvin Bassey to nod it home at the back post. Manuel Ugarte, who lost Muniz's run, and Noussair Mazraoui, who was marking Bassey, won't want to see a replay.\n\nIt was the fifth time in a row United conceded the first goal. In Amorim's 24 games in charge, United have conceded the first goal 16 times. That's a damning stat on its own, but particularly when the team is struggling to score itself. Goalless again in the first 45 minutes, United have failed to score from open play in 19 consecutive first halves.\n\nAmorim's list of problems is a long one. Among other things, he was able to name only seven substitutes instead of the permitted nine. Of those on the bench, two were young goalkeepers.\n\nIt's lucky for Amorim that Bruno Fernandes is so durable. After a week that has seen more criticism come his way courtesy of former captain Roy Keane, the Portuguese midfielder showed again that he is United's most important player. He might not rank with Keane or Paul Scholes as one of the club's greatest ever midfield players; he is, though, the undisputed star of this team.\n\nIt was Fernandes who dragged United level in the second half, ghosting in to whip Diogo Dalot's cross into the bottom corner. The technique was exquisite, but he made it look simple.\n\nFernandes now has six game-changing goals this season -- three winners and three equalisers -- and has more goals (11) and assists (12) than anyone else. He stepped up first in the penalty shootout and rifled his shot into the net in front of the Stretford End, but he can't do it all on his own and in the absence of 11 Brunos, both Lindelof and Zirkzee saw their efforts saved by Bernd Leno. The Fulham keeper was outstanding, making key saves from Alejandro Garnacho and Chido Obi to keep the game level.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" Leno said after the win. \"I think we deserved to win after 90 minutes. Of course, penalties, it is sometimes a lottery and luckily, we won. The goalie coach told me a couple of informations, but my feeling is more important.\"\n\nFulham have a quarterfinal against Crystal Palace to look forward to. For Amorim, it's Europa League or bust.\n\nThe Portuguese coach has lost 10 of his 25 games since replacing Erik ten Hag in November. United are refusing to countenance that he could be under pressure so early into his tenure, but there was an acceptance before the defeat to Fulham that the cup competitions are important -- both in terms of extending interest in the season and providing a pathway into Europe.\n\nLanguishing 14th in the Premier League table and now out of the FA Cup, United are left with just the Europa League. A pivotal week in Amorim's short reign rests on Real Sociedad.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 season of the Indian Super League is in full swing, and with games coming thick and fast, this is a convenient place to catch up on every match. We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures | ISL Playoff Scenarios\n\nHere are the details for matchweek 23 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n\nEast Bengal FC 1-1 Bengaluru FC\n\n(Raphael Messi-Bouli 11', Dimitrios Diamantakos 45+2' RC - Sunil Chhetri 90+1' (P))\n\nEast Bengal's hopes of making the ISL playoffs for the first time came to a heartbreaking end, when a late Sunil Chhetri penalty earned Bengaluru FC a point. The hosts were in complete control in the first half and made a valiant effort playing the second half with 10 men after Dimitrios Diamantakos was sent off just before the break, but were denied with a 1-1 draw. BFC climbed to third in the table, while East Bengal can only finish with a maximum of 31 points this season, not enough to overcome NorthEast United's 32 points in sixth place.\n\nDiamantakos and PV Vishnu had chances for East Bengal in the opening ten minutes, but Oscar Bruzon did not have to wait long for East Bengal to score the opener. Hernan Crespo and Raphael Messi-Bouli exchanged passes down the right wing before the former went down after being tripped on the edge of the box, but kept play going with a toe-poked pass forward into space. Messi-Bouli pounced on the ball in the box, before lashing home a low drive past a static Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to give the hosts the lead in the 11th minute.\n\nThey ought to have been 2-0 up in the 27th minute when Vishnu skied a shot over after Chinglensana Singh's mis-control in the box looped up wonderfully for him, but the East Bengal player fluffed his lines. Naorem Mahesh Singh's strike from range that found the net was also ruled out for offside with Diamantakos deemed to be interfering with play. The hosts came to rue those moments in first-half injury time, when Diamantakos was sent off after appearing to lean in and headbutt Alberto Noguera.\n\nBengaluru FC weren't able to do much with their man advantage after the break, although Ryan Williams and Edgar Mendez remained enterprising. Souvik Chakrabarti and Mahesh went close with long-range strikes on the hour mark, but the game remined finely poised. BFC ought to have equalized with 20 minutes to go, but Mendez skied Roshan Singh's cross from close range, and five minutes later Sivasakthi Narayanan hit the post. East Bengal then nearly scored from the resulting counter when David Lalhlansanga was put through on goal by Mahesh, but Gurpreet came out to smother his shot and make the save.\n\nThe East Bengal goal led a charmed life, when with 10 minutes to go, Aleksander Jovanovic headed onto the post, Prabhsukhan Gill saved Williams shot from the rebound and Sana couldn't convert the resulting rebound from a narrow angle as well. The hosts' luck finally came to an end in the 90th minute, when Nishu Kumar's handball in the box resulted in a penalty, and Sunil Chhetri duly converted to make it 1-1, sending the keeper the wrong way and grabbing a draw for BFC.\n\nKerala FC 1 - 1 Jamshedpur FC\n\n(Korou Singh 35', Milos Drincic OG 86')\n\nJamshedpur FC came from behind to earn a point in a 1-1 draw against Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi, a result that ousted the home side out of playoffs contention. Korou Singh scored a brilliant goal to put the home side ahead in the first half before Milos Drincic's own goal brought Jamshedpur FC back into the game in the second half.\n\nWith this draw, Kerala Blasters can only reach a maximum of 31 points, which is a point less than the sixth-placed NorthEast United FC (32), with still two matches in hand.\n\nBoth the teams started the match slowly and became more assured in possession as the match progressed. Given that it was a must-win game for the Kerala Blasters FC, they showed more urgency than their counterparts, who had already qualified for the playoffs.\n\nKerala Blasters FC eventually broke the deadlock in the 35th minute when Korou Singh scored a brilliant solo goal. It all started with Albino Gomes' goal kick which reached the Kerala Blasters FC penalty area and was headed away by Dusan Lagator. The stray ball was picked up by Korou, who came up with a great header to leave Stephen Eze high and dry in midfield. The youngster turned back in a jiffy, controlled his header, and ran past three defenders before beating Albino from a tight angle with a vicious effort.\n\nIn the second half, with the visitors not creating enough chances to get back into the game, Khalid Jamil decided to introduce Rei Tachikawa in midfield in the 59th minute at the cost of Lazar Cirkovic. Things took a drastic turn in the 86th minute when Sreekuttan got hold of a stray ball on the right wing. The youngster delivered a decent cross into the box but it ricocheted off Milos Drincic into his own net, awarding the equaliser to Jamshedpur FC.\n\nMumbai City 2 - 2 Mohun Bagan\n\n(Toral 57', Rodrigues 89'; Maclaren 32', Petratos 41')\n\nMumbai City came from behind to gain a point against league shield winners Mohun Bagan in the early kickoff on Saturday. After playing well in the first half, Bagan went into the break 2-0 up thanks to goals from Jamie Maclaren and Dimi Petratos (who was handed a rare start as Molina shuffled things up after they sealed the title in their last game). Maclaren was played through by an errant back pass and he made no mistake with the one-on-one while Petratos swept in a rebound after good work from Liston Colaco on the left.\n\nCity came back via another rebounded effort from Jon Toral before Vikram Pratap Singh got a second yellow card and got sent off moments later. Staring at an uphill task against the meanest defence in the league, Nathan Rodrigues made the most of confusion in the Bagan box to score the leveller.\n\nThe point keeps Mumbai in prime position to qualify for the playoffs with two games to go for them.\n\nOdisha FC 0-0 Mohammedan SC\n\nIn what could be a terminal blow to Odisha FC's season, they drew 0-0 at home against Mohammedan SC, failing to make up ground on the top six. In truth, Odisha were lucky to not lose the game. It was Mohammedan who created all the best chances, and with better composure in the final third from either Franca or Alexis Gomez, they could have won the game too.\n\nAs it stands, with just one game to go in their season, Odisha are on 30 points, two behind both NorthEast United and Mumbai City FC, who have played one and two games less than Odisha respectively. Lobera's team now need a massive favour from Mumbai and NorthEast's remaining opponents, while also needing to take full points from their final game, away to Jamshedpur.\n\nPunjab FC 0 - 1 FC Goa\n\n(Carl McHugh 45')\n\nFC Goa beat Punjab FC 1-0, solidifying their grip over the second spot, which could guarantee them a straight semi-final berth, while Punjab were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs race.\n\nFC Goa stepped in with intent, displaying fluidity in their gameplay and produced a well-coordinated corner kick in the eighth minute as Borja Herrera's precise delivery met Odei Onaindia on the far post. Onaindia, however, was positioned laterally, and hence he didn't go for a direct attempt at goal, instead laying up a headed pass for Carl McHugh. Muheet Shabir Khan pre-empted this and stopped it with a timely save in the ninth minute.\n\nHowever, McHugh was successful in finding the back of the net at the end of the first half. Udanta Singh delivered a long throw-in for the Irish midfielder, who was looking to break into the Punjab FC box with a quick sprint. McHugh met the delivery properly, drilling the ball into the bottom left corner with his left foot to score the only goal of the match.\n\nPunjab FC kept pressing for the equaliser right until the end, but were not successful.\n\nWith this win, Goa moved to 45 points in 22 games which puts them ahead of the third and fourth placed Bengaluru FC and Jamshedpur FC respectively by eight points each, though the latter have three games in hand to cut that deficit. Punjab FC are in 11th place with 24 points from 22 matches, and thus eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nEast Bengal 2-0 Hyderabad FC\n\n(Manoj Mohammed (OG) 86', Raphael Messi Bouli 90+4')\n\nEast Bengal beat Hyderabad FC 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata to make it three wins in a row for the first time in their ISL history. Their two goals came right at the end, with a Manoj Mohammed own goal breaking the deadlock in the 86th minute, before Raphael Messi Bouli's goal in the fourth minute of second half stoppage time.\n\nEast Bengal are now in eighth spot with 27 points from 22 games.\n\nManoj's attempted headed clearance off a corner deflected into his own net, before Saul Crespo and Messi Bouli combined for the second goal on a counter-attack, where Crespo was quick to spot the pass through to Messi Bouli in the centre of the Hyderabad box. He slotted into the bottom left corner to double the lead and take three points for Oscar Bruzon's men, who next face Bengaluru FC at home on Sunday.\n\nBengaluru FC 1-0 Chennaiyin FC\n\n(Rahul Bheke 37')\n\nBengaluru FC are through to the playoffs. Chennaiyin FC won't make it. That, after a sweet Rahul Bheke volley gave Bengaluru a 1-0 win at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Tuesday, to make it a league double for Gerard Zaragoza's side against Chennaiyin this season.\n\nIt was a quick turnaround for Bengaluru after their win against NorthEast United in Shillong last week, but they showed no signs of real fatigue throughout the game, as they put pressure on Chennaiyin, and defended stubbornly when they had to, to ensure Owen Coyle's team have nothing but pride and league position left to play for in their final two games of the season - both at home in Chennai.\n\nThe decisive moment in the game came through a superb set-piece. Alberto Noguera floated the ball over to the back-post, where Bheke was unmarked. He still had a lot of work to do, though, but met the ball sweetly on the half volley to put it into the top corner, giving Mohammad Nawaz no chance in goal.\n\nChennaiyin had two massive opportunities to score, one in either half. Wilmar Jordan missed a free header from point-blank range, and then in the last few minutes of the game, Daniel Chima Chukwu should've scored after controlling the ball around the six yard box, but somehow skewed his shot wide.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 ISL season has reached its business end, with around a month of league stage fixtures left before the playoffs commence in mid-March.\n\nIt has been a competitive season, as this league always seems to produce. As it stands, the 13 teams have all played at least 19 of their allotted 24 league games, and only Mohammedan SC are out of contention for the playoffs. MSC have only managed 11 points from 19 games, in what has turned into a troubled debut ISL campaign.\n\nFor the other 12 teams, there is all to play for in the next month, although that could change for a couple of teams, who need more than just a miracle for them to make it to the playoffs. Here's how each team stands at the moment, and their potential route to the playoffs:\n\nCurrent Points: 53 in 23 games\n\nGoal Difference: +29\n\nA perfect, record-breaking campaign has seen Mohun Bagan become the first team to defend the League Shield title - after a last-gasp win over Odisha FC courtesy Dimi Petratos. Their last game is now nothing more than a formality.\n\nRemaining Matches: FC Goa (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 45 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: +16\n\nA month or so ago, FC Goa fans may have looked at that last league away to Bagan as a shield-decider, but Bagan have just been way too good. The shield is gone for Goa, but their remaining games are no less important. They have guaranteed second place in the league, so their final two games are little more than preparation for the semifinals.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mohammedan SC (H), Mohun Bagan (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 38 in 23 games\n\nGoal Difference: +11\n\nThat win against Jamshedpur at the Kanteerava came at the perfect time for Bengaluru. They'd gotten just a point from six games before that one, so it was a significant result against a team above them on the table. And then they went on to defeat NorthEast United 2-0 and Chennaiyin FC 1-0 which confirmed their place in the playoffs - while also elimination East Bengal with a 1-1 draw.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mumbai City FC (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 38 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: -2\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, there was a thought that Jamshedpur could be the ones to really push Bagan for the shield. Losses to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and NorthEast United have snuffed that thought out. However, they have taken a step closer to making it to the playoffs after beating Mohammedan SC 2-0. Bagan's win over Odisha also saw Jamshedpur qualify for the playoffs.\n\nRemaining Matches: Odisha FC (H), Chennaiyin FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 33 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: 0\n\nMumbai City have struggled to score goals all season. Only the bottom three have scored fewer than them. However, only Mohun Bagan have conceded less than they have. The goalless draw against Hyderabad looked to have put a secure top 6 spot into a precarious position, but Mumbai all but sealed their spot with a 2-2 draw against Bagan.\n\nRemaining Matches: Kerala Blasters (A), Bengaluru FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 32 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: +10\n\nHow far could they have dreamt if they somehow found some steel and solidity to complement the phenom that Alaaeddine Ajaraie has been this season? The Moroccan has had arguably the greatest individual season in ISL history - and that deserved to be fighting for bigger honours rather than clinging on to a playoff spot. The loss against Bengaluru made it tricky for NorthEast, but two points from their last two games will be enough.\n\nRemaining Matches: Chennaiyin FC (A), East Bengal (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 30 in 23 games\n\nGoal Difference: +6\n\nTheir season has been a peculiar one, but not particularly difficult to describe. The average age of their foreigners has caught up with them this season. This hasn't been the lively, attacking Sergio Lobera side we've seen for years in the ISL and that drop in pace and intensity has been seen in their results. They now have their playoff hopes completely out of their hands. They can go to only 33 points, at most. If NorthEast and Mumbai both get even one win in their remaining games, Odisha will be out.\n\nRemaining Matches: Jamshedpur FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 28 in 23 games\n\nGoal Difference: -2\n\nAt no point in this season has it felt like East Bengal have ever clearly threatened the top six positions. They nearly appeared to be pulling off a miracle against Bengaluru FC, but a late penalty ensured they were eliminated from contention.\n\nRemaining Matches: NorthEast United (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 25 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: -5\n\nThe chance they'd given themselves earlier seems to be slipping away as they dropped to ninth. A 1-1 draw at home to Jamshedpur FC ended their hopes of making the playoffs with two games to go.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mumbai City FC (H), Hyderabad FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: -5\n\nLast season's excellent playoff run and what looked like a good summer transfer window hasn't translated to on-pitch results for Owen Coyle and Chennaiyin. A late winless run and a loss to Bengaluru FC confirmed their elimination from playoff contention.\n\nRemaining Matches: NorthEast United (H), Jamshedpur FC (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: -6\n\nA season that began so promisingly for Punjab has gone a little pear-shaped. The 0-1 loss to Chennaiyin eliminated them from playoff contention, and with dead rubbers left - there's not much left to play for.\n\nRemaining Matches: Hyderabad FC (A), Mohammedan SC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 17 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: -23\n\nIt's been a tough season for Hyderabad, even if it has been better than last season. They've had their moments, like the win away in Kerala and at home against Jamshedpur. NorthEast's win over Jamshedpur and their loss to Odisha saw them drop out of contention for the playoff spots.\n\nRemaining Matches: Punjab FC (H), Kerala Blasters (H)",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMohun Bagan, champions, of course. An incredible way for one of the great ISL careers to end. The playoff spots beginning to take shape in totality. All that and more in this week's ISL musings:\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures | ISL Playoff Scenarios | ISL Matchweek 22\n\nTo Mohun Bagan is to win\n\nIt's just as simple as that. India's most storied football organization, in its latest avatar, is about just one thing - winning. By attractive means or attritional, Mohun Bagan just know how to get the job done. Of course, one can point to the money spent in assembling this squad of superstars, but that is exactly the kind of ambition that results in league titles won in a dominant fashion.\n\nLet's be real, no ISL team should have the luxury of bringing on Dimi Petratos as an impact sub. Mohun Bagan do. They've got that and more. That's why they've become the first ISL side to breach the 50-point barrier, albeit in the league's longest season yet. That's why the destination of the league shield has been a foregone conclusion for a couple of months now.\n\nDimi Petratos, a Mohun Bagan super giant \ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/c0poL4sHzu - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) February 23, 2025\n\nThe win to seal the shield, a 1-0 over Odisha FC, was as Mohun Bagan as they come. All season, they've somehow found a way to win. This time, it was a strike from distance by the man the faithful have christened DimiGod, that finally beat an Odisha rearguard that was threatening all night to put this Mariners party on hold for at least a week more.\n\nIt was a season that begin with a bit of turmoil, Jose Molina's attritional safety-first style wasn't turning heads at the maidan. The fans' frustration only turned into anger after they lost the Durand Cup final and then started slowly in the ISL, even losing 3-0 in Bengaluru. However, since then, Molina's machine has just purred along, blips have been few and far between. The first team to retain the ISL league shield are the most dominant table-toppers this league has perhaps ever seen.\n\nHow can your star player go AWOL?\n\nAsk Odisha FC. Ask the best midfielder to grace this league in its decade-long existence. The long and short of it is that Odisha don't know where Ahmed Jahouh is, they just know he's unilaterally decided to leave. No explanation, no reasons given.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd: Ahmed Jahouh has unilaterally left the club without providing any reason or information to the club. The club considers this as a serious breach of contract and is considering an appropriate action. Further details will be communicated once the due process is... pic.twitter.com/9Z6Z42dzr2 - Odisha FC (@OdishaFC) February 22, 2025\n\nIf that is the last we see of Jahouh in the ISL, then it is such an anticlimactic way for his time in India to end. He's been a joyous player to watch ever since Sergio Lobera brought him along to FC Goa in 2017. With his economy of movement and wand of a right foot, Jahouh made football look easy.\n\nIt's no wonder that Lobera took him wherever he went in Indian Football. From Goa to Mumbai to Odisha, the Spanish coach didn't change his general in the middle of the park. Of course, with age, the movement became even more economical, and he sometimes became a luxury in midfield with the legs not quite what they used to be. That didn't make him any less of a joy to watch.\n\nRaking cross-field passes which were pinpoint in their execution, the nonchalant flicks, the supreme understanding of the game unfolding in front of him, and even the occasional temper tantrum on the field, watching Jahouh was always a spectacle, so if he's indeed left these shores with this sort of whimper, it is a sad end to life in India for him.\n\nKratky's changed Mumbai City are not a good watch\n\nThey're tough to beat, they're tough to even score goals against, but one thing that Petr Kratky's Mumbai City FC also are, are tough to watch. It's a weird thing to be saying about this Mumbai City side, who only last season, produced thrilling attacking football on their way to winning the ISL Cup.\n\nVarun / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nSo what has changed this season? They've lost their ball progressor from midfield in Alberto Noguera, and their new overseas recruits haven't quite set the league on fire. Also, the speed of their wingers hasn't really come to the fore against teams who are now willing to take a step back and watch Mumbai move the ball around in front of them, with no penetration.\n\nLallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and Brandon Fernandes have threatened all season to burst out of the attacking malaise surround Mumbai City, only to be sucked right back into it once again.\n\nA defence of their cup will only happen if they improve in attack, but on the plus side, the other half of their game looks in pristine condition. They really do know how to keep clean sheets. Can they do that against the best teams in the league, though?\n\nDon't underestimate the scale of Jamshedpur's achievement\n\nJust as Mohun Bagan's title has looked destined for a couple of months, so has Jamshedpur FC's spot in the playoffs. Now, that is confirmed, Khalid Jamil's side will finish in the top six. It is an incredible achievement for a group of players and manager who weren't given much of a chance before the start of the season, particularly with their recruitment not being high-profile.\n\nJamshedpur FC are a stereotypical Khalid Jamil side, and will be awkward playoff opponents for anyone. Dipayan Bose / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nHowever, this is the stereotypical Jamil team. They are unspectacular to a fault. They run their socks off in every game. They are relatively organised in defence, and in the likes of Javi Hernandez and Javi Siverio, have enough know-how in attacking areas to be a threat at all times.\n\nThat was all perfectly summed up in the win that took them into the playoffs - a 2-0 success over Mohammedan SC away. Jamshedpur had lesser possession than a team bottom of the standings, attempted fewer passes and made more fouls than Mohammedan as well. Jamil has never been one for aesthetics, though. The mission he set out for at the start of the season is now accomplished. They're among the ISL's big boys for certain.\n\nThey're likely to finish in the top four, guaranteeing them a home tie in the knockout playoff round before the semifinal. One thing is for sure, no team wants to be traveling to Jamshedpur for that one, both in terms of the fatigue-inducing travel and the team that they will face.\n\nBig Gurpreet decision pays off for Zaragoza and BFC\n\nFor 14 games starting from mid-October, Bengaluru FC hadn't kept a single clean sheet until their home game against Jamshedpur last week. Now they've got two in a row. Poor Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's worst club season ever took another turn, for better or worse, as he was benched in favour of Lalthuammawia Ralte in goal.\n\nWhether this is a long-term change is immaterial. Gerard Zaragoza finally realised the need to take Gurpreet out of the firing line. Ralte has played his part well enough. His best days won't be as good as Gurpreet's best, of course, but right now, Bengaluru need solidity, a calm presence who doesn't make any mistakes. Ralte did one better in Shillong against NorthEast United, as he made a couple of excellent saves to keep Bengaluru's clean sheet intact, particularly one off an Alaaeddine Ajaraie header, as he threw himself up to his left and palmed the ball onto the crossbar.\n\nHe did pick up an injury late in that game, which makes his presence for the next couple of games a doubt, but at a moment in their season when Bengaluru needed calm, Ralte brought that for them and set the base for six points in two games, which almost certainly wraps up their spot in the playoffs too. Oh, and Alberto Noguera has played a bit of a role in that too. The Spaniard's three goals in the last two games have been such a vital contribution following that run of six winless games.\n\nToo little, too late for East Bengal, but what could have been?\n\nJust like Chennaiyin, East Bengal have now put together two wins in a row, but their playoff hopes are hanging by a thread, needing a number of other results to go their way to even entertain the prospect of playing in the post-season.\n\nDipayan Bose / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nThis week, they produced a polished attacking display against Punjab FC. Naorem Mahesh Singh was bright out wide, Dimitrios Diamantakos was an imposing presence in the middle. It was all that they'd dreamt of when they spent big money to bring the Greek striker to Kolkata in the summer. It hasn't quite worked out that way.\n\nOscar Bruzon will rue the results they had in January, particularly his usage of Mahesh in a central role, that he clearly seemed out of place in. He's a lovely technical player, is Mahesh, but he couldn't quite come to terms with the challenge of having to transfer those skills from the wide positions to the central areas.\n\nNow, back in his favourite wide area, he's once again having a critical impact on East Bengal's games. For Bruzon, there's a bigger play here too. The ISL playoffs may be out of reach now, but he needs his big players fit and firing for the AFC Challenge League quarterfinal tie against Turkmenistan's Arkadag next week.",

                "text": "Semi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the fifth round of the FA Cup this weekend. (1:30)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Premier League spent two years testing a number of artificial intelligence-based semiautomated offside technology (SAOT) providers, and now it's ready to be rolled out.\n\nUEFA was first to introduce SAOT in the Champions League from the start of the 2022-23 season group stage, quickly followed by FIFA for the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nSAOT will be make its debut in English football this weekend in the FA Cup fifth round, featuring in the seven ties being played at Premier League grounds (stream all eight FA Cup matches this weekend LIVE on ESPN+ in the U.S.).\n\nWhat is this new technology, how does it work, and is it really any better?\n\nWhy does VAR offside need to change?\n\nLong delays, perceived inaccuracies and a lack of confidence in the system among fans, players and coaches. And that's just for starters.\n\nScepticism also comes from the poor visualisation of decisions, with lines placed on the pitch that cannot replace a person's own perspective of an offside decision on a camera angle. A player may look onside, but the technology says they are offside. At other times, the lines are so close to each other it's hard to understand the outcome.\n\nSelecting the exact point the ball is touched by the passer cannot be determined accurately because of the frame rate of TV cameras (50 frames per second).\n\nThe VAR manually selects the farthest forward point on both defender and attacker (or the ball if applicable), which cannot be applied consistently or accurately. Then there's the time it can take to judge offside, in some cases up to five minutes for complex decisions, and that adds further frustration.\n\nSome grounds cause more trouble than others, too. Offside has proved particularly troublesome for the VAR at Selhurst Park, where it took over four minutes to confirm a Crystal Palace goal earlier this month.\n\nAll in all, supporters don't really trust the process as it works now -- not helped by a number of high-profile errors either.\n\nIn February 2023, the VAR failed to identify that a Brentford player was offside in the buildup to a goal at Arsenal. On the same day, the lines had been placed on the wrong Crystal Palace defender, leading to a Brighton & Hove Albion goal incorrectly being disallowed.\n\nAnd in October 2023, Liverpool had a goal ruled out for offside on the field at Tottenham Hotspur which the VAR mistakenly failed to correct. However, the error on the Luis D\u00edaz goal was primarily around communication rather than the technology -- an issue SAOT would not be able to fix by itself, but one that a less complicated process may help to prevent.\n\nSo what is semi-automated offside technology?\n\nDeveloped by technology company Genius Sports, the Premier League says it creates a \"more efficient placement of the virtual offside line\" by taking the mapping of the relevant players out of the hands of the VAR and into the control of technology.\n\nRather than a referee placing lines onto a 2D TV screen, SAOT will plot the players in 3D.\n\nIt will also bring an \"enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\"\n\nWhat is it going to look like?\n\nThis is as important as any other part of this project. It was incredibly difficult to visualise offside decisions, and now fans will effectively be moved almost in line with the assistant referee to show an offside.\n\nMuch like goal-line technology, a 3D animation is created that will be shown at the stadium and on TV. The animation will also be posted on the @PLMatchCentre X account.\n\nThe exact point on the attacker which is deemed offside is highlighted, and a simulation will create a \"wall\" indicating the offside line. If a player is offside, the relevant part of the body will break through that \"wall.\"\n\nUnlike with SAOT used in other leagues, the animation will not move directly in line with the two players as that can obscure the decision and be as confusing as the old tech.\n\nIt will be far easier to understand for supporters at the ground or watching on television, and like fewer delays should lead to less criticism.\n\nThis can take several minutes in the Champions League, as the visualisation is overlayed onto the TV coverage. In the Premier League and the FA Cup, it will be standalone so should be much quicker.\n\nThis is how the offside graphic will appear in English football. The FA\n\nHow does SAOT work?\n\nIncredibly, the Premier League's SAOT uses a FIFA-validated iPhone-based system known internally as \"Dragon,\" rather than lower frame rate broadcast cameras. There will be 30 iPhone, model 14 or newer, installed under the roof of the 20 Premier League grounds -- or for the purposes of this weekend the seven top-flight stadiums hosting FA Cup games.\n\nThese cameras provide optimal tracking for the ball and all 22 players, recording 10,000 surface \"mesh\" data points per player on all limbs and extremities that are relevant for an offside decision -- including the upper arm, toes, knees and head -- so the system knows the exact position of a player at any given moment. An offside player can be automatically \"flagged\" in the SAOT software.\n\nData will be captured at a rate of 100 frames per second -- double the 50 frames per second used in the current offside technology.\n\nAll player and ball data is processed in real time, which triggers an alert to the VAR. The VAR must then validate that the kick point and offside line are accurate, and the offside player is active, and then inform the referee who can confirm or change the on-field decision.\n\nThe referee will still have to go to the pitchside monitor if there is a subjective offside decision (for instance an attacker in the goalkeeper's line of sight) to be changed.\n\nWhy is SAOT better?\n\nAccusations of human error -- sometimes founded, others more conspiracy theory -- have always dogged VAR and offside. By taking the process out of the hands of the VAR and into the control of software, accusations of operator bias can be put to bed.\n\nSo, how is that achieved? SAOT automates the mapping process and produces a result much more quickly. It removes all subjectivity from this part of the process, and the average time taken for an offside VAR review will be cut by 30 seconds.\n\nThe Premier League also believes that SAOT will increase confidence in decision-making by reducing the reliance on manually checking all potential offsides -- therefore reducing the likelihood that a potential decision is missed by VAR.\n\nIt's semi-automated because the VAR still has to confirm the result, and the technology cannot tell whether an attacker is actively involved in play or confirm the ball was touched by a teammate of that player.\n\nThe VAR will also have to validate the kick point, because there is no chip in the ball in the Premier League version of the technology.\n\nStill, time taken definitely erodes confidence. So, if SAOT can make everything noticeably quicker we might at least lose one of VAR's areas of criticism.\n\nThere are 30 camera in stadium roofs to determine offside positions. The FA\n\nWhy isn't there a chip in the ball, and does it matter?\n\nThe beauty of the chip in the ball is it gives undeniable accuracy over the play of the ball. But Adidas, the provider for FIFA and UEFA, developed the original SAOT and it owns the patent for how the chip sits in the centre of the ball to ensure reliability.\n\nThat patent means any other ball manufacturer would need to find a new way of balancing a chip without infringing the Adidas patent. As no top European league has a contract with Adidas, they've had to develop their own software.\n\nWithout the chip, it has to work slightly differently. SAOT will suggest a kick point to the VAR and automatically create the offside line to that frame.\n\nTony Scholes, the Premier League's chief football officer, said earlier this month that he doesn't believe the lack of a chip will be a problem.\n\n\"We believe we're going to be adopting the best system and the most accurate system without the need for the chip in the ball,\" he insisted. \"We believe it to be the most accurate and the most futureproof system as well and that's why we went with that.\"\n\nBetween the frames, optical tracking is able to interpolate the player and ball movements with the system providing a continuous flow of data.\n\nRight now we only have the official line to go on, the proof will come when we see it in action -- the Premier League has certainly done plenty of testing.\n\nMore accurate? So more offside goals, and \"toenail\" decisions?\n\nThis is good news, because the Premier League is going to retain the existing \"tolerance level,\" sometimes referred to as \"thicker lines,\" which gives a \"benefit of the doubt\" to the attacker of around 5cm.\n\nIt was introduced in 2021-22 after complaints about those so-called \"toenail\" calls where you can barely tell that a player is offside.\n\nThis isn't in place in the Champions League, LaLiga, Serie A or FIFA competitions, as seen in the image below from the World Cup, which produced some extremely marginal SAOT offside decisions.\n\nIf the Premier League had removed the \"tolerance level\" we'd definitely have seen more goals disallowed, as there are many across a season which fall into this category.\n\nHowever, if English football is keeping it, that might suggest that the Premier League isn't yet totally happy with its accuracy. The whole point of the \"tolerance level\" in the old technology was to compensate for the inaccuracies and inconsistencies.\n\nSo, in English football, we won't be going back to the incredibly tight offside calls we saw when VAR was first introduced. However, there will always be the marginal point when onside becomes offside -- you cannot change that whatever system you have.\n\nOther competitions with SAOT have seen incredibly tight decisions. Fox\n\nWill there still be any long delays for VAR checks?\n\nLonger delays should be rarer, because SAOT means the VAR won't have to go through the manual process of mapping the players.\n\nHowever, there will be occasions when there are subjective elements to a decision. Is a player interfering with play? Has there been a \"deliberate play\" of the ball by the defender? Is an attacker in the line of vision of the goalkeeper? Those decisions, and others with multiple offside elements, will take longer.\n\nThere will also be situations where players block each other in the system's cameras, or there may be multiple checks in one phase.\n\nFor instance, there was an offside check in Everton vs. Manchester United earlier this month which took over three minutes, and SAOT would not have improved that as it wasn't just related to player positions.\n\nAdded to that, as this is new technology the Premier League wants decisions to be checked rather than taken on faith, only for a mistake to be found.\n\nEven in the Champions League with a chip in the ball, there can still be lengthy delays.\n\nWill SAOT be used for all offside decisions?\n\nNo, so it's still possible for a corner to result from a missed offside.\n\nThe VAR will only activate SAOT in one of the match-changing moments covered by VAR -- goals, penalties and red cards.\n\nWhat about the delayed offside flag?\n\nWhile it's true SAOT can work out player positions quickly, as its only for use on VAR reviews we haven't seen the end of the delayed offside flag.\n\nPlay will still continue in an attacking situation until the end of the phase, when the assistant will raise their flag.\n\nSo this is the FA Cup. When will we see SAOT in the Premier League?\n\nPremier League clubs unanimously voted to introduce semi-automated VAR offside technology for the 2024-25 season almost a year ago.\n\nIt was supposed to come in after one of the international breaks at the end of 2024, but problems with testing meant it was further delayed.\n\n\"We are still testing it, but we are making significant progress,\" Scholes added. \"We're in a different place to when I spoke to managers just over Christmas, we've made a lot of progress in this area.\n\n\"Now I'm hopeful that at some point this season we will be able to introduce semi-automated technology but I repeat the points I've made a number of times. We are not going to introduce it if we've got any doubts at all with regards to its operation.\"\n\nShortly afterward the FA, the Premier League and PGMOL announced a joint agreement to trial it in the FA Cup.\n\nIt could yet feature in the Premier League in the final weeks. Scholes also defended the prospect of switching from the legacy VAR offside technology to SAOT when the majority of the season will have been played.\n\n\"It's a very fair question and we've sort of questioned ourselves about this,\" Scholes admitted. \"But fundamentally, the operation of semi-automated offside technology does not change the integrity of the offside law and doesn't change the integrity of the decision making.\"\n\nHowever, you have to feel that testing the FA Cup for the rest of the season and launching in the Premier League next season makes more sense. After all, there's only 11 rounds of fixtures remaining.\n\nIs SAOT in any other leagues?\n\nSerie A was the first European domestic league to switch to SAOT, introducing it in January 2023 after a high-profile VAR error early in that campaign had seen a stoppage-time winning goal for Juventus incorrectly disallowed. Mexico's Liga BBVA MX also introduced it in January 2023, and it has been used in the CONMEBOL Libertadores, South America's equivalent of the Champions League.\n\nLaLiga brought in SAOT at the start of the 2024-25 season.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe international break is almost upon us, and for those vested in Indian football that means just one thing: the return to action of the national team.\n\nWith India scheduled to play against Maldives in a friendly on the 19th, and an Asian Cup qualification match against Bangladesh on the 25th, Manolo Marquez will shift focus slowly to his second job.\n\nBut what must he focus on? After a pretty average start to life as coach of India, we list out few ideas that Marquez ought to consider for the two matches.\n\nStart Brison Fernandes\n\nWe know Liston Colaco and Manvir Singh are nailed on as forwards (usually wide) in the squad, and they've had very solid individual seasons for the Mohun Bagan winning machine this Indian Super League season. But who else is in the frame?\n\nLallianzuala Chhangte is as out of form as we've ever seen him, Mahesh Singh seems a bit lost, Bipin Singh is a shadow of his usually confident self, and let's not even mention what has happened to the big hopes that are Kiyan Nassiri and Gurkirat Singh (the last two struggling for minutes in a team that's struggling for goals... Nassiri started one game and that was at wingback, Gurkirat has gotten 169 minutes across 11 matches).\n\nBesides, the top scoring Indian is... well, not available for selection. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (unless you want to bring India fans to tears) is the joint-second highest scorer in the league this season (11) and only one of two Indians in the top 10.\n\nThe other, then, ought to be an automatic contender to start for the team in the upcoming window. Brison Fernandes has impressed with his finishing (7 goals) in a season where Indians have been horribly goal shy. He's got all sorts of finishes in his locker too - long-range curlers, headers from inside the six-yard box - and it should help that Marquez, as Brison's coach at FC Goa, knows exactly what he is and isn't capable of. For a team that's scored two goals in four games under new management, the need for Brison's ability to sniff out a goal is rather self-explanatory.\n\nBrison Fernandes has been in stunning form for FC Goa. Adimazes/ISL\n\nA call-up, and a start, will also be a sign to others that consistent league form will be rewarded by the national team setup.\n\nMix in the old and the new\n\nFor instance, as an option, Udanta Singh. As good as the theoretical construct that Udanta Singh as a footballer has always been - fast, direct, runs all day (and both ways), has a decent shot on him - it's rarely translated to tangible action on the football field. Which is where Marquez has come in, again.\n\nDeployed as fullback and winger alternatingly, Udanta has been very consistent down the Goa right - creating chances, providing solidity and just doing the basics right. As an option off the bench, Marquez could do far worse.\n\nThere are others too who may be worth a punt. While inconsistent, Isak Vanlalruatfela's running from deep, Mohamed Sanan's brutal directness, Nikhil Prabhu's calmness at the back and MS Jithin's chance creation ability on the counter are all useful traits that Marquez could use off the bench. Besides, injecting new (even newish) blood into the matchday squad would urge the more established squad members to shrug off complacency.\n\nMake Vishal Kaith the #1\n\nThis has to be the least controversial, most non-debatable opinion in world football. Vishal Kaith should be India #1. Period.\n\nWhy Vishal Kaith should be India's no.1 goalkeeper\n\nVishal Kaith of Mohun Bagan is the sole exception to the general decline in Indian Super League goalkeeping standards. Abhijit Addya/Focus Sports/ FSDL\n\nStart Sande... well, Marquez knows this\n\nThis is third FC Goa player we are mentioning here, but this one is more of a coincidence than anything to do with Manolo Marquez. When Sandesh Jhingan's in, both India and Goa are better teams: his leadership is unparalleled, and his presence in the backline exudes a sense of security no one else in the national team provides as of now.\n\nMarquez knows this better than anyone: without Jhingan, Goa looked a leaky, sub-par outfit. With him, they look the only team capable of challenging Mohun Bagan at the top. The effect he's had on the team is remarkable, really, and there are no doubts he'll start for India now that he's properly fit again.\n\nMaximise the offensive threat of Subhasish Bose\n\nHWMNBN and Brison are in fact two of only three Indians in the top 25(!) of the ISL goalscoring charts. The other is... Subhasish Bose. And it's not in the way you'd expect a left back to be an offensive threat.\n\nFile photo of Subhasish Bose AIFF Media\n\nBose has, this season, been a consistent threat on set pieces, scoring six goals - including ones that came in tight, tight matches. It's not just him winning headers first-time but what he does on the second ball, pouncing on chances inside the six-yard box like a first-rate centre forward.\n\nSet pieces have been a traditional strength for India, and using Bose's ability to introduce chaos from them could be a key element of India's set piece planning.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nI'm all for accountability after poor performances, both from players and from coaches. On Wednesday night, after getting knocked out of the Coppa Italia by relegation-threatened Empoli, Juventus boss Thiago Motta took it to a new level and introduced a whole moral dimension that, frankly, isn't his business to do.\n\n\"I feel shame, and I hope the players do too,\" he said postmatch. \"We have hit rock-bottom: our performance was unacceptable. We need to apologise to the fans, to the history of this club.\"\n\nA bit over the top, but fair enough. A week earlier, Juventus had been eliminated from the Champions League by PSV Eindhoven following a second-half display that was about as inept as their first half against Empoli on Wednesday. Given that they're eight points back in the Serie A title picture, maybe the realization hit Motta that his last remaining chance for silverware -- other than the Arsene Wenger Fourth-Place Trophy -- had evaporated.\n\nThen, he doubled down.\n\n\"Our supporters were far too gentle with us, especially in the first half,\" he added. \"I know we're going to get criticised, I hope that criticism is harsh!\"\n\nIt's not often you hear a coach sound positively masochistic -- especially when said coach, just a week earlier, had waved off questions about the PSV Eindhoven defeat by saying: \"I regret nothing. If I had to do it over again, I would have made all the same choices.\" A week later, he's sounding like one of a re-education camp graduate engaging in self-criticism.\n\nOr is he? Because in those same postmatch talking points, Motta went on to trot out the same fuzzy, metaphysical culprits that coaches always love to bring up when things go wrong: effort and attitude.\n\n\"Attitude is non-negotiable ... it's the first thing I tried to teach them when I took this job,\" he said. \"This is true in football, but more importantly, in life. I will never accept what I saw against Empoli!\" Oh, and he didn't stop there.\n\n\"There are some who take without giving,\" Motta continued. \"It makes me physically ill and ashamed! I have never criticised any of my teams in the past because the attitude was always there! This time it's different! You have to give everything out there on the pitch and respect Juventus ...\"\n\nAnd then, sounding like a frustrated parent scolding a child who's been caught doing something they shouldn't, Motta added: \"It's my responsibility, I obviously wasn't able to teach them the importance of having the right attitude and respecting the Juventus uniform.\"\n\nThere are several reasons all of this is problematic.\n\nGAB & JULS PODCAST Gabriele Marcotti and Julien Laurens dive into the latest news and gossip, analyze matches with special guests, and give their perspective on the world of football. Stream now\n\nFirst off, it's playing to the gallery in the most crass way, telling the angry fans what they want to hear: the players don't care. They don't love the club like you do, they don't respect the club like you do, they just care about their influencer girlfriends, tricked-out Lambos and paychecks. It helps rile up the angry villagers with pitchforks and torches, fine. The problem: once you've thrown the players under the bus (and the transfer window is closed), you're stuck with them and they're stuck with you, a guy who questions their attitude in public. Not to mention the fact that saying \"some take without giving\" is only going to lead to speculation about who he means, or which offenders are worse offenders than others.\n\n(For what it's worth, and I was only watching on TV, a number of Juventus players -- from Federico Gatti to Kephren Thuram to Dusan Vlahovic -- seemed to be lacking quality or tactical instruction more than \"attitude.\")\n\nSecond, Motta lecturing about the importance of \"attitude\" in life is just out of place. Those aren't his children; they're grown men. They don't need his self-help lectures about how to be happy and successful adults in their private life. Do that on your own time, for your own benefit, and stick to your job.\n\nThird, it raises an uncomfortable question. If Juve were putrid against Empoli because they had the wrong \"attitude,\" what was the problem against PSV? It wasn't your tactical approach, because you told us you regretted nothing. Was their \"attitude\" wrong then too and you just hid it from us? Are they maybe not that good? Is their coach not that good?\n\nFourth, and perhaps most importantly, for the rest of this news cycle -- at least until their game against Verona on Monday night -- we end up talking about his \"shame\" and their \"attitude\" rather than other stuff that might be relevant, because there are myriad reasons why faith in Motta's Juventus team is at an ebb.\n\nThere's the fact that they recorded a whopping \u20ac87 million net spend -- a figure that, in real terms, is even higher if you consider the many loans, some with an obligation to buy, and the fact that they're spending more than \u20ac11m for the privilege of having Randal Kolo Muani, Renato Veiga and Lloyd Kelly hang around until the end of the season -- and the team is a slow and laboured model of inconsistency even when they win.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nThere's the fact that that the recruitment strategy seems to fit together as smoothly as Travis Scott performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir: the highest-paid player and top scorer (Vlahovic, who earns more than every single player in the Premier League bar one) regularly gets benched, the most expensive summer signing (midfielder Teun Koopmeiners) has been a bust thus far, and the second-most expensive summer signing (Douglas Luiz) has been on the bench for 14 of the 17 occasions he's been in the squad.\n\nThen there are all the issues Motta and sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli inherited or could do little about: a club that lost in excess of \u20ac325m over the past two seasons (a legacy of the disastrous end of the Andrea Agnelli regime), that is disentailing itself from a bunch of bad contracts, that endured season-ending injuries to their backup center-forward Arek Milik and half of the first-choice back four (Juan Cabal and Gleison Bremer), and that portion of the Juve fan base (and media) who are incurably nostalgic for the Max Allegri era and that brand of football.\n\nAll of these are complex issues that are tough to sort through. It's not clear at all if Motta's sudden \"shame\" and faux accountability are part of the problem or part of the solution.",

                "text": "Semi-automated offside technology will be introduced in the fifth round of the FA Cup this weekend. (1:30)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nPep Guardiola insists there's reason for optimism at Manchester City, despite a troubled campaign that has seen the defending champions reduced to battling for a place in the top four.\n\nFollowing Wednesday's 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur, a result that boosted their hopes of playing Champions League football next season, the City boss laid out what he believes should be a \"bright future\" at the Etihad Stadium. (The victory moved them into fourth place, a point above Chelsea, with 11 games remaining.) \"The young players and the new acquisitions maybe the club will do in the summertime -- in the next transfer window -- have to lead this club for the next few years,\" he said.\n\nThey echoed his comments after Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool. \"I saw a bright future,\" Guardiola told the BBC. \"Other than Kevin [De Bruyne] and Nathan [Ake], they are the future of this club in the next years, with others who will come in future windows.\n\nGuardiola and new director of football Hugo Viana -- who has replaced the outgoing Txiki Begiristain -- are facing a summer rebuild as they plot their way back to the top. There's a core of established stars to build around and some exciting young players with huge potential, but also decisions to be made on some of the old guard, including Kevin De Bruyne, who is out of contract in the summer.\n\nAhead of Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round tie vs. Plymouth Argyle (stream LIVE, Saturday, 12:15 p.m., ESPN+), we take a look at the state of City and whether the future is as bright as Guardiola believes.\n\nThe untouchables\n\nOne nice thing for City is that they're not starting their rebuild from scratch. Erling Haaland has signed a mammoth contract that runs through 2034, and Phil Foden, who has already racked up more than 300 club appearances before the age of 25, has shown no desire to ever leave the Etihad.\n\nBeyond those two, defender R\u00faben Dias has been a key part of City's success since arriving from Benfica in 2020 and is a vocal presence in the squad. He has struggled for form and fitness this season -- like many of his teammates -- but is still only 27 and a strong character in the dressing room. Dias could take on an even more prominent role if there is an exodus of experienced players in the summer.\n\nThere has been a long-held belief by some at City that Rodri would one day be keen to return to Spain, but that talk has died down and there's hope he will be fully recovered from his knee injury by the time preseason training begins in July and August.\n\nThe significant investment in Omar Marmoush in January means he will also be part of City's future. The Egyptian, signed for \u00a360 million from Eintracht Frankfurt, has made a positive start in a difficult situation after joining an underperforming team midseason.\n\nLegends coming to the end?\n\nThis is where Guardiola and Viana will have to make big decisions.\n\n\u00c9derson, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Kevin De Bruyne have been cornerstones of the team that won the treble in 2023 and completed four titles in a row in 2024. But nothing lasts forever, and there are now serious question marks about their futures.\n\n. Shaun Brooks - CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nEach situation is different and delicate. De Bruyne is out of contract in the summer, while G\u00fcndogan has a one-year option in his deal that would take him to 2026 if it's exercised. There's interest in De Bruyne from teams in Saudi Arabia and the United States, and Galatasaray believe they have got a good chance of landing G\u00fcndogan. \u00c9derson was close to moving to the Saudi Pro League last summer, and Silva has long wanted to return to continental Europe, whether Spain, France or Portugal.\n\nThe problem facing City is that \u00c9derson, De Bruyne and Bernardo would need to be replaced, and that won't be cheap. Florian Wirtz at Bayer Leverkusen is a target to replace De Bruyne, but there would be stiff competition from Bayern Munich and possibly Real Madrid.\n\nIf \u00c9derson leaves, City could either make Stefan Ortega first-choice and sign an understudy or make a move for another No. 1 such as FC Porto's Diogo Costa.\n\nAre they part of the future, or is it time to go?\n\nTop of the list is Jack Grealish. At 29 and with four years at City under his belt, he should be indispensable. But he's not. He has not been a regular in the team since the treble season, which means, naturally, his future is up in the air.\n\nWith two years left on his contract, City would demand a fee before letting him leave. There have been vague links with Tottenham Hotspur or a return to Aston Villa, but it's likely to take significant investment -- translation: wages plus transfer fee -- to get a deal over the line.\n\nplay 0:30 'Next!' - Guardiola refuses to respond to questions about Javier Tebas Pep Guardiola shuts down questions about LaLiga president Javier Tebas accusing Man City of manipulating their balance sheets\n\nIt's different with John Stones because the issue isn't his performances, but his durability. Into his ninth season at the Etihad and approaching his 31st birthday, he has only once been able to make more than 25 league appearances in a single campaign. His latest injury picked up against Real Madrid is set to rule him out for between eight and 10 weeks.\n\nGuardiola's biggest problem this season has been injuries, and it would be natural if he began to favor players he knows can stay fit.\n\nYoungsters looking to establish themselves\n\nThe success of City's next cycle will depend heavily on the young players the club have already invested in. If defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis; midfielders Nico Gonzalez, Claudio Echeverri and Rico Lewis; and forwards Savinho, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku, Oscar Bobb and James McAtee can realize their undoubted potential, then their next formidable team won't be far away.\n\nSavinho, Khusanov and Lewis -- all starters against Liverpool on Sunday -- are only 20, while Reis and Echeverri, two of the most exciting prospects to come out of South America in recent, are still teenagers. The main issue with young players is that there's always an element of risk.\n\nIt's impossible to tell at 19 or 20 who might be a world-beater by the time they're 25 or 26. City can only hope that the gambles pay off.\n\nThe next generation coming through\n\nCity have one of the best academy setups in the country and they currently sit top of Premier League 2 (for under-21s) and the under-18 Premier League north group. Midfielder Nico O'Reilly (19) and defender Jahmai Simpson-Pusey (19) have both made appearances this season, while striker Divin Mubama (20) scored against Salford City in the FA Cup in January.\n\nCity have been good at moving on young players for big fees, although they turned down a substantial bid from Chelsea for O'Reilly on deadline day in January. The decision might have been influenced by a growing feeling that City missed a trick by not asking for more when Cole Palmer moved to Stamford Bridge in 2023.\n\nAnd what about Pep in all of this?\n\nThe City boss quieted the noise around his own future by signing a contract extension in November. His deal runs until 2027, and he insisted after the Champions League defeat to Real Madrid that he intends to honor it. But it hasn't stopped nagging questions about whether Guardiola needs the stress that comes with another rebuild. He has achieved everything in England and the only challenge left in management is to lead a national team at a major tournament. After such a grueling campaign and so many problems to navigate, City fans will only feel confident he's definitely staying when they see him on the training pitch preparing for next season.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIs any team better-placed than Real Madrid for domination in the medium term? Let's crunch the numbers. Diego Souto/Getty Images\n\nIt's safe to say that Liverpool have been the best team in the world in 2024-25. Arne Slot's team is now the overwhelming favorite to win the Premier League -- Arsenal have 12 matches to make up 11 points -- and the betting favorite to win the Champions League, though there's plenty of work remaining there. With 30 goals and 21 assists in 38 matches (in all competitions), Mohamed Salah is enjoying just about the best contract year any athlete has ever had in any sport; everything has come up Reds in Slot's first year succeeding Jurgen Klopp.\n\nIn other words, Liverpool own the present tense, but thanks primarily to the Transfer Rumor Industrial Complex, our soccer discussions always involve at least a hint of the future, too.\n\nFor Liverpool, expiring contracts for Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold have remained talking points throughout this brilliant run. Of the 16 Liverpool players with at least 1,200 minutes in all competitions this season, only three are under 25 years old. The club has a lot of decisions to make moving forward, and as we've seen with Manchester City's difficulties this season, dominating now certainly doesn't guarantee dominance in the future.\n\nSo, as we watch Liverpool's and others' title pushes move forward across Europe's top five leagues, let's take a minute to look far into the future. Never mind contract talks and potential summer moves; let's talk about which clubs are best positioned to succeed, say, three years from now.\n\nHow we're going to do this\n\nPeering into a crystal ball can never, ever be an exact science, but let's at least bring some math to the conversation. To determine the future power rankings below, I broke things into four categories:\n\n1. Club consistency and quality. This accounts for about 37% of the rankings and factors in things such as teams' current Opta power rankings (to capture current quality), their four-year performance in league play (consistency) and their overall Transfermarkt roster value (upside and potential).\n\n2. Young talent. When Liverpool broke through under Klopp in 2018-19 (Champions League title) and 2019-20 (Premier League title), they did so with a core roster of players perfectly crafted to peak around the same time. Since the generally assumed peak age range for a player is around 24 to 28 (with exceptions), and we're looking about three years into the future, I looked at the combined Transfermarkt values for teams' players currently under 25 years old. This accounts for about 32% of the rankings.\n\n3. Money. Duh. Those with the cash run the sport, and while money has played an obvious role in both (1) and (2) above, I also incorporated the past three years of figures from the Deloitte Football Money League, plus teams' current estimated wages (from FBref.com and other sources). This is about 18% of the formula.\n\n4. Who's just really well run? This produced the oddest rankings of the bunch, but I wanted it to play a role. Call it the \"Manchester United don't deserve to be that high on the list!\" factor. Using a ratio of estimated wages to actual performance -- which props up the likes of Club Brugge and Lille a bit, while knocking down teams like Manchester United and West Ham -- I factored this in for about 13% of the formula. Most of the top teams rank right in the middle in this regard (which makes sense, since the best clubs are also the richest and don't have to be perfectly run), but there are some outliers.\n\nI ended up using a list of 122 teams -- basically, anyone in either the top 100 of Opta's power rankings or Transfermarkt's combined player values -- to come up with these rankings. Let's see who owns the future. (No. 1 won't surprise you at all.)\n\nConsistency: No. 2 | Young talent: No. 2 | Money: No. 1 | Well run: No. 72\n\nReal Madrid have the most money and arguably the best set of under-25 talent in the world. Attackers Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo are 24, utility man Eduardo Camavinga is 22, do-it-all midfielder Jude Bellingham is 21, and the club is still working on establishing roles for sparkling youngsters Arda G\u00fcler (20) and Endrick (18).\n\nplay 1:20 How good can Endrick be for Real Madrid? Alejandro Moreno breaks down Endrick's goal against Real Sociedad and looks ahead to how impactful he can be for Real Madrid.\n\nThe only reason they're No. 2 on the Young Talent list is that Chelsea has signed half of Europe's 19-year old pros in recent years, and looking specifically at under-25 talent undersells the club a bit considering Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is only 26. Eighteen players have logged at least 900 minutes in all competitions for Real Madrid this year, and only four of them are in their 30s. Luka Modric's endless presence skews the average age a bit, but the team's new generation has been well-established.\n\nThey'll need a new manager following Carlo Ancelotti's impending departure, and anytime they want to stop complaining about and seemingly trying to manipulate the officials, that'd be great. They don't need the help: they're the gold standard moving forward.\n\nConsistency: No. 1 | Young talent: No. 5 | Money: No. 3 | Well run: No. 74\n\nThe well-bankrolled French giants are well on their way to their 11th Ligue 1 title in 13 seasons, and unlike in many recent seasons, they're winning with relative youth in 2024-25. Of their top 14 minutes-earners this season, only three are older than 26, and even with 27-year-old Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 enjoying an incredible season (23 goals and five assists in all competitions) and 24-year old Khvicha Kvaratskhelia having just arrived, under-25s have accounted for 54% of the team's goals and 63% of their assists.\n\nBradley Barcola (20), Warren Za\u00efre-Emery (18) & Co. are setting PSG up to succeed for quite a while.\n\n3. Manchester City\n\nConsistency: No. 3 | Young talent: No. 3 | Money: No. 2 | Well run: No. 76\n\nIn the present tense, City are an absolute mess. They entered 2024-25 a bit on the creaky side and immediately lost their most important player, Rodri, to a season-ending injury. They then collapsed to a degree never seen from a Pep Guardiola side, and while it appears they've righted the ship to some degree, any goals they brought into the season are virtually toast. Oh yeah, and the 115 charges still loom as a black cloud overhead for at least a little bit longer.\n\nplay 1:44 Will Man City finish in the top four of the Premier League? Craig Burley and Nedum Onuoha break down Manchester City's chances of finishing in the top four of the Premier League after a 1-0 win over Tottenham.\n\nOh yeah, and they also still have Erling Haaland (24), Phil Foden (24), Josko Gvardiol (23), J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku (22), Savinho (20), the fruits of a recent January spending spree -- Omar Marmoush, Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis -- and the backing of one of the richest entities to own a soccer club. The present tense might be a bit spotty, but unless the club's fight against the Premier League results in a massive point deduction and relegation, City's future is still as bright as anyone's in England.\n\nConsistency: No. 5 | Young talent: No. 4 | Money: No. 5 | Well run: No. 71\n\nFirst, we must acknowledge the flaws in my methodology. There was no built-in punishment, in either the \"Money\" or \"Well run\" categories, for Barcelona's insistence on spending future money to fund shaky spending in the present, or for their constant issues with registering their players with their cap restraints. If I were ranking this club subjectively, I would not have them anywhere near the top in \"Money,\" and I'd consider ranking them far lower in \"Well run.\" That said, I'd also subjectively rank them No. 1 in the \"Young talent\" category.\n\nIn recent years, no club has better saved itself from itself by producing talent from within. For all their issues, they still have Pedri (22), Gavi (20), Pau Cubars\u00ed (18) and the otherworldly forward Lamine Yamal (17), plus players such as Marc Bernal (17), Marc Casad\u00f3 (21) and even Ansu Fati (22), who are very much young enough to still become major stars. We should just expect La Masia to produce further strong contributors as well.\n\nThere's no telling what desperate levers might be pulled in the coming years, but Barca has the strongest base of young talent to lean on, and that will take them a long way. (Hell, it might take them to a LaLiga crown and the Champions League final this very season.)\n\nConsistency: No. 8 | Young talent: No. 8 | Money: No. 6 | Well run: No. 77\n\nBayern have basically built two different squads over the past couple of years. One is veteran-heavy, dominated by stalwarts such as Joshua Kimmich and Manuel Neuer and newer veterans such as Harry Kane. The other Bayern is young and tantalizing. With Michael Olise (23) joining over the summer, Jamal Musiala (21) and Alphonso Davies (24) signing recent contract extensions and others such as Aleksandar Pavlovic (20) and Josip Stanisic (24) coming into their own, Bayern: The Next Generation looks awfully exciting.\n\nDespite injuries and up-and-down play of late, Bayern are well on their way to reestablishing themselves atop the Bundesliga hierarchy this season, and among teams in the bottom half of the Champions League bracket, they've got the second-best odds of reaching the final. Just imagine what might happen when Musiala & Co. approach their prime.\n\n6. Arsenal\n\nConsistency: No. 6 | Young talent: No. 6 | Money: No. 9 | Well run: No. 70\n\nDespite this sport's rampant impatience, Arsenal have slowly and methodically built a dynamite squad. The proof of this is their current frustration. Arsenal finished between fifth and eighth in the Premier League every season between 2016-17 and 2021-22, but they're now disgruntled at the thought of an injury-plagued (and third straight) second-place finish. They're finally going to finish ahead of Manchester City this season, but Liverpool butted their way to the front of the line.\n\nplay 1:24 Marcotti suggests Arsenal start teenage 'phenom' over Merino up-front Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss Arsenal's striker struggles and make suggestions for who could replace Mikel Merino.\n\nThat said, Arsenal's time could still be coming. With both Liverpool (age and expiring contracts) and City (existentialism) facing impending questions, Mikel Arteta continues to compile young depth. William Saliba (23), Gabriel Martinelli (23), Bukayo Saka (23), Riccardo Calafiori (22) and now Myles Lewis-Skelly (18) and Ethan Nwaneri (17) could form a dynamite roster core, and other key players such as Martin \u00d8degaard (26), Declan Rice (26) and Kai Havertz (25) aren't exactly old. Injuries remain a concern, and Gunner fans were frustrated by a lack of January transfer activity, but it feels like everything this club has done in recent years has been with a 2025-27 peak in mind.\n\n7. Liverpool\n\nConsistency: No. 4 | Young talent: No. 13 | Money: No. 7 | Well run: No. 66\n\nLet's be honest: So far, these future power rankings have looked a lot like the current power rankings. Not exactly a revelatory, controversial list. But this one's pretty interesting. Liverpool have the current best team in the world and plenty of money, but using the criteria at hand, they aren't positioned quite as well as others for future world domination.\n\nDespite a breakout season from midfielder Ryan Gravenberch (22) and sustained quality from Dominik Szoboszlai (24) and Curtis Jones (24), under-25 players have accounted for only 26% of Liverpool's minutes, 25% of their assists and 13% of their goals this season. Meanwhile, four players aged 30 or older have logged at least 2,100 minutes in all competitions, and two (Salah and Van Dijk) have recorded at least 3,200 minutes.\n\nThe club has serious choices to make when it comes to contract extensions for Van Dijk (likely) and Salah (mysterious), but regardless of those choices, it has quite a bit of work to do when it comes to building for the future.\n\n8. Chelsea\n\nConsistency: No. 18 | Young talent: No. 1 | Money: No. 8 | Well run: No. 86\n\nIn transitioning from Roman Abramovich's ownership to Todd Boehly's BlueCo, Chelsea flipped from being a rich club that acquires some of the world's best talents to being a rich club that acquires as much young talent as possible.\n\nThe approach has given them an abundance of fun youngsters: Thirty-six different under-25 players have seen the pitch for the club this season, including eight teenagers, and under-25s have accounted for 68% of Chelsea's minutes, 62% of their goals and 77% of their assists. Cole Palmer has quickly become one of the Premier League's best attackers (though he's battling a bit of a funk at the moment), and no club has a higher volume of intriguing youngsters.\n\nplay 0:54 Will Cole Palmer remain 'happy' if Chelsea don't reach the Champions League? Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens question why Enzo Maresca said Chelsea will ask Cole Palmer if he is still \"happy\" if they fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nOh yeah, and Chelsea are seventh in the Premier League right now, having won just three of their past 12 matches in all competitions. This could be their third straight season finishing sixth or worse in the league. None of this asset compilation has paid off yet from a results perspective, and even if it eventually does, you could easily wonder if simply paying lots of money for fewer, more proven players would have paid off more quickly.\n\nRegardless, Chelsea certainly have enough raw potential to be a strong team three years from now. Even if they need to prove themselves more than they have of late.\n\nConsistency: No. 9 | Young talent: No. 11 | Money: No. 36 | Well run: No. 23\n\nThe first club on the list that isn't a financial superpower is the reigning Bundesliga champion that employs both manager Xabi Alonso and elite attacker Florian Wirtz. Since neither of them will likely be employed by the club in three years, you can question Bayer Leverkusen's position on this list. But their consistency levels are high, and few have proved more well run when it comes to reinvesting transfer sales into exciting transfer acquisitions. If (or when) they lose Wirtz, they are likely to reinvest the money they receive in a quality fashion.\n\nWhile Wirtz is an otherworldly talent, Leverkusen's recent rise has come because of their depth of young talent: They also have Amine Adli (24), Jeremie Frimpong (24), Victor Boniface (24) and Piero Hincapi\u00e9 (23), not to mention a number of key contributors between ages 25 and 27. They won't consistently reach the heights they saw last season when they rolled unbeaten to the Bundesliga title, but this club increasingly looks built for the long haul.\n\nConsistency: No. 22 | Young talent: No. 7 | Money: No. 10 | Well run: No. 85\n\nLike Chelsea, Spurs haven't really turned potential into production of late. They're currently languishing in 12th place (despite being tied for the third-best goal differential in the league), and they are well on their way to missing the Champions League for the fifth time in six seasons. No club has pulled the \"Bring in a manager, sign players that suit his style, then fire the manager and replace him with his stylistic opposite (and then sign players that fit his style, and so on, and so forth)\" routine more than Spurs in recent years, and it has been to their detriment.\n\nThey have money, though, and concerns about stylistic incongruity aside, they've amassed quite a bit of exciting young talent at this point, from Dejan Kulusevski (24) to Micky van de Ven (23), from Brennan Johnson (23) to Pape Matar Sarr (22), and from Destiny Udogie (22) to Bayern loanee (for now, anyway) Mathys Tel (19).\n\nIt's obviously hard to say manager Ange Postecoglou is the definite long-term answer there, but when you've got money and young talent, you're going to grade out respectably on a list like this.\n\n11. Manchester United\n\nConsistency: No. 35 | Young talent: No. 9 | Money: No. 4 | Well run: No. 101\n\nplay 1:40 Dawson explains how INEOS have divided Man United fans Rob Dawson says the changes INEOS have made to Manchester United have caused a split among the club's fans.\n\nManchester United are basically a magnified Tottenham Hotspur at this point: They have even more money, and they've created even more problems for themselves in terms of a long-term vision. They've earned that triple-digit \"Well run\" ranking. But again: They have money, and they have Manuel Ugarte (23), Amad Diallo (22), Alejandro Garnacho (20), Kobbie Mainoo (19), Leny Yoro (19), Rasmus H\u00f8jlund (22), Joshua Zirkzee (23) et al. They're only a few good decisions away from fielding an intriguing team.\n\nCould you have said this at any point in the past 12 years? Of course! Did they make those good decisions at any point? Of course not! But it remains true.\n\nConsistency: No. 14 | Young talent: No. 20 | Money: No. 13 | Well run: No. 62\n\nThe first Italian team on this list is one that has mostly disappointed in the 2020s. Since their nearly decade-long run of Scudettos ended in 2020-21, the club has been forced to reckon with the number of shaky financial decisions it had made in attempting to keep that streak alive and finally break through with another Champions League title. That reckoning has actually turned out to be a pretty good thing.\n\nWhile Juve were basically dragged, kicking and screaming, into acquiring and playing younger players (often with \"loan with an obligation to buy\" deals), they've also created the most exciting young roster core in Serie A with wingers Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o (22) and Kenan Yildiz (19) enjoying intriguing seasons and early-prime players like Timothy Weah (26), Nico Gonzalez (26) and Teun Koopmeiners (26) all playing well.\n\nInconsistency caught up to them in their recent Champions League exit, but they've worked their way back into Italy's top four, and there's far more reason for optimism here than there was a couple of years ago.\n\nConsistency: No. 36 | Young talent: No. 10 | Money: No. 20 | Well run: No. 42\n\nBased on the pure number of decisions they had to nail to advance from the third division in 2010-11, then from the Championship in 2016-17, then from an average Premier League point total of 39.5 for four seasons to 53.7 over the past three (and a current pace for about 58.5 in 2024-25), it's safe to say they should probably rank higher than the 40s in the \"Well run\" category. It's incredible to think about where the Seagulls have come from and where they might still be able to go.\n\nGranted, ranking 13th on this list still makes you seventh in England, but with strong revenue and a strong-as-ever base of young talent -- Carlos Baleba (21), Joao Pedro (23), Yankuba Minteh (20), Georginio Rutter (22), Bart Verbruggen (22), Jan Paul van Hecke (24), Yasin Ayari (21), Jack Hinshelwood (19), Tariq Lamptey (somehow still only 24) -- it wouldn't be a surprise if Brighton eventually pushed into a Champions League spot (they're currently just four points away) even though they're destined to lose a few of these players to richer English squads.\n\nWe know the ceiling will forever be higher for the Manchester Uniteds of the world, but no club has raised its own ceiling more than Brighton over the past decade.\n\nConsistency: No. 15 | Young talent: No. 22 | Money: No. 22 | Well run: No. 31\n\nDominate your domestic league, then lose your best players for huge transfer fees before you officially have the pieces to make a major Champions League run. Rinse and repeat.\n\nBenfica have won six of the past 11 Primeira Liga crowns and reached the quarterfinals of either the Champions League or Europa League five times in nine seasons. (They'll have to beat Barcelona in March to make that seven of 12.) But they haven't made it past a quarterfinal since reaching the Europa League final in 2013 and 2014. Still, they're tied with Sporting atop the domestic table this season, and they lead Sporting (17th) by a nose on this list because of recent revenue.\n\nThey've got quite a few young players playing important roles this season, including Orkun K\u00f6k\u00e7\u00fc (24), Tom\u00e1s Ara\u00fajo (22), Ant\u00f3nio Silva (21), Anatoliy Trubin (23) and \u00c1lvaro Carreras (21), and while some of those players will inevitably land in the Premier League soon, the base of talent here is impressive. Benfica probably have the highest upside of Portugal's heavyweights at the moment.\n\nConsistency: No. 17 | Young talent: No. 18 | Money: No. 47 | Well run: No. 8\n\nLike Bayer Leverkusen, Atalanta's place on this list is perhaps tied more than is preferable to the qualities of a specific manager; if Gian Piero Gasperini, 67, ever loses his touch or decides to retire, then a spot in this top 15 might not seem as clear. But with Gasperini in place, Atalanta have punched above their weight class as well as almost any club in the world.\n\nThe defending Europa League champions have played in the Champions League in four of the past six seasons (and came achingly close to the semifinals in 2020), and they're currently third in Serie A and well-positioned to make it next year, too. (They're also only three points out of first place.) They lose stars, replace them with new stars and press forward. And while some key players in their 30s have logged major minutes this season -- midfielders Marten de Roon and Mario Pasalic, defender Berat Djimsiti -- Gasperini plays a ton of guys. Mateo Retegui (25) and Ademola Lookman (27) have combined for 41 goals and 11 assists in all competitions this season and aren't exactly old, and under-25s like Charles De Ketelaere and Lazar Samardzic have accounted for 35% of Atalanta's assists and 20% of their goals.\n\nThe pipeline of talent remains strong.\n\nThe full list of 122 teams is at the bottom, but before we unfurl the whole thing, let's look at categories and countries.\n\nTOP FIVE CLUBS: CONSISTENCY\n\n\u2022 1. PSG\n\n\u2022 2. Real Madrid\n\n\u2022 3. Manchester City\n\n\u2022 4. Liverpool\n\n\u2022 5. Barcelona\n\nPSG certainly could have benefited from stronger domestic competition of late, but there's no doubting that they've been steadily successful in Ligue 1.\n\nTOP FIVE CLUBS: YOUNG TALENT\n\n\u2022 1. Chelsea\n\n\u2022 2. Real Madrid\n\n\u2022 3. Manchester City\n\n\u2022 4. Barcelona\n\n\u2022 5. PSG\n\nAgain, Real Madrid probably have the biggest young names, but Chelsea have the most. They just have yet to parlay that into actual success.\n\nTOP FIVE CLUBS: MONEY\n\n\u2022 1. Real Madrid\n\n\u2022 2. Manchester City\n\n\u2022 3. PSG\n\n\u2022 4. Manchester United\n\n\u2022 5. Barcelona\n\nReal Madrid and Manchester City have traded the top spot in the Deloitte money rankings in recent years, but it goes without saying that they are both ridiculously powerful from the perspective of pure financial heft. So are Manchester United, no matter what dysfunction has stemmed from said heft.\n\nTOP FIVE CLUBS: WELL RUN\n\n\u2022 1. Club Brugge\n\n\u2022 2. Bologna\n\n\u2022 3. Columbus Crew\n\n\u2022 4. Lille\n\n\u2022 5. Union Saint-Gilloise\n\nHello, Columbus! The Opta power ratings loved the Crew last season -- they reached as high as the 50s for a moment -- though the baked-in parity measures of Major League Soccer will likely drag them down soon. Regardless, only a couple of teams can top them in terms of the wages-to-power-ratings ratio I used here.\n\nLet's quickly lay things out by country as well.\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: ENGLAND\n\nEngland featured seven of the top 13 teams above, but who else fills in an English top 10?\n\n\u2022 1. Manchester City (third overall)\n\n\u2022 2. Arsenal (sixth)\n\n\u2022 3. Liverpool (seventh)\n\n\u2022 4. Chelsea (eighth)\n\n\u2022 5. Tottenham Hotspur (10th)\n\n\u2022 6. Manchester United (11th)\n\n\u2022 7. Brighton (13th)\n\n\u2022 8. Newcastle (19th)\n\n\u2022 9. Aston Villa (29th)\n\n\u2022 10. Bournemouth (33rd)\n\nI was honestly surprised Newcastle and Aston Villa didn't both rank higher.\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: SPAIN\n\n\u2022 1. Real Madrid (first overall)\n\n\u2022 2. Barcelona (fourth)\n\n\u2022 3. Athletic Club (22nd)\n\n\u2022 4. Atletico Madrid (23rd)\n\n\u2022 5. Real Sociedad (31st)\n\n\u2022 6. Villarreal (37th)\n\n\u2022 7. Girona (65th)\n\n\u2022 8. Osasuna (70th)\n\n\u2022 9. Real Betis (71st)\n\n\u2022 10. Valencia (75th)\n\nAtletico Madrid's presence in the 20s is interesting. They too are driven by the power of a specific manager (Diego Simeone), and even by their veteran-loving standards, they've allowed themselves to age quite a bit: under-25s have logged only 12% of their minutes in all competitions this season, and only two (right midfielder Giuliano Simeone and central midfielder Pablo Barrios) have made any real contributions. Meanwhile, nine players aged 30 or older have recorded 1,200-plus minutes.\n\nThat's a bad ratio, even for them, and Atleti likely have a roster refresh ahead.\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: GERMANY\n\n\u2022 1. Bayern Munich (fifth overall)\n\n\u2022 2. Bayer Leverkusen (ninth)\n\n\u2022 3. Borussia Dortmund (18th)\n\n\u2022 4. RB Leipzig (20th)\n\n\u2022 5. Eintracht Frankfurt (26th)\n\n\u2022 6. VfB Stuttgart (35th)\n\n\u2022 7. Mainz (73rd)\n\n\u2022 8. Freiburg (78th)\n\n\u2022 9. Wolfsburg (83rd)\n\n\u2022 10. Borussia Monchengladbach (103rd)\n\nWhile Bayer Leverkusen graded out quite favorably, two other clubs known for thriving with younger talent -- Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig -- barely scraped out top-20 rankings. Neither is performing as well as expected this season, and neither ranks in the top 10 in young talent either. In a world in which the Real Madrids and Chelseas are content with simply acquiring teenage up-and-comers to begin with instead of acquiring them from BVB or RBL after a few years of development, these clubs' developmental identities are in flux. I'm fascinated by how each chooses to build from here.\n\n(Also: Wow, what a drop-off from the top six to the rest of the country. No German club ranks between 36th and 72nd on the list.)\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: ITALY\n\n\u2022 1. Juventus (12th overall)\n\n\u2022 2. Atalanta (15th)\n\n\u2022 3. Inter Milan (21st)\n\n\u2022 4. AC Milan (24th)\n\n\u2022 5. Napoli (32nd)\n\n\u2022 6. Fiorentina (40th)\n\n\u2022 7. Bologna (41st)\n\n\u2022 8. Lazio (42nd)\n\n\u2022 9. Roma (46th)\n\n\u2022 10. Torino (74th)\n\nIt's notoriously difficult for younger players to break through in Serie A, therefore it's obvious Italian clubs would struggle to stand out on a list like this. Juve got into the top 15 with a begrudging youth movement, and Atalanta did so via the power of Gasperini, but both Milan clubs rank in the 20s, and Napoli are in the 30s. Only one under-25 player has recorded more than 900 minutes for Inter (defender Yann Bisseck, 24), and only one under-24 player has recorded even 100 minutes (midfielder Kristjan Asllani).\n\nAC Milan, meanwhile, have involved a few more young players -- Yunus Musah (22), Malick Thiaw (23), Strahinja Pavlovic (23) -- but didn't grade out nearly as well as rivals Inter from a consistency perspective.\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: FRANCE\n\n\u2022 1. PSG (second overall)\n\n\u2022 2. Monaco (25th)\n\n\u2022 3. Lille (28th)\n\n\u2022 4. Marseille (43rd)\n\n\u2022 5. Lyon (48th)\n\nThere's no reason to expect PSG's run of Ligue 1 dominance to end anytime soon, but I was curious who might take the second spot. As it turns out, Monaco eked it out over Lille thanks to youth. Players like Maghnes Akliouche, Eliesse Ben Seghir and Wilfried Singo (and, when healthy, Folarin Balogun) could either front a very good Monaco team soon or earn it healthy transfer fees.\n\nFUTURE POWER RANKINGS: EVERYWHERE ELSE\n\n\u2022 1. Benfica, Portugal (14th)\n\n\u2022 2. PSV Eindhoven, Netherlands (16th)\n\n\u2022 3. Sporting CP, Portugal (17th)\n\n\u2022 4. Feyenoord, Netherlands (27th)\n\n\u2022 5.

Slavia Prague, Czechia (50th)\n\nPredictably, the top five names here (and six of the top seven) are from either Portugal or the Netherlands, aka the best European leagues outside of the Big Five. The most well-positioned clubs from either North or South America, by the way? Palmeiras (57th), Columbus Crew (68th), Botafogo (79th), Flamengo (89th) and River Plate (97th).\n\nAND FINALLY, THE FULL LIST\n\n\u2022 1. Real Madrid (Spain)\n\n\u2022 2. PSG (France)\n\n\u2022 3.

                "text": "We're nearly at the end of 2020, which means it's time for ESPN's annual ranking of the best men's players and coaches in world soccer! Welcome to the FC 100.\n\nThis year, our fifth edition of the countdown has a lot of surprises and new faces -- more on that later -- as well as two teams rising above the rest to dominate the list. As always, our list is broken down into 10 Top 10s for every position on the pitch as well as managers, making for the most meaningful and deep look at the talent across the men's game from goalkeeper to striker.\n\nJump to: Goalkeepers | Right-back | Centre-back | Left-back | Central midfield | Attacking midfield | Wing | Forward | Striker | Manager\n\nRead the FC 100 in: Spanish | Portuguese\n\nPrevious editions of the FC 100: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016\n\nThe top spots were dominated by two clubs: Bayern Munich, winners of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League, and Liverpool, winners of their first league title in 30 years. They claimed every No. 1 spot except for two, ATTACKING MIDFIELD and FORWARD -- see if you can guess who took those prizes? -- as our voters leaned into their on-field domination.\n\nA couple of other themes emerged in this year's ranking, too:\n\n-- New names, new faces\n\nThis was arguably the most diverse and most refreshed FC 100 since we began in 2016. Nearly half the list -- 47 out of 100 -- were either new to the FC 100 or not ranked in 2019, which reflects not only the challenges of the 2019-20 season amid the coronavirus pandemic but also the turnover of top players and the generational \"passing of the guard\" to a younger group of superstars. Erling Haaland (Borussia Dortmund), Achraf Hakimi (Inter Milan) and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) all pop up after transcendent seasons, as do Leon Goretzka (Bayern), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa) and Houssem Aouar (Lyon).\n\nThis kind of refreshment is exactly what we're seeing in the game as aging legends fade and new stars are made.\n\n-- Americans are back?\n\nIt might not seem like much, but after being shut out in 2019 for many reasons, the USMNT gets two into the 100 this time around: Christian Pulisic returns -- after a stellar 2020 until injuries hit -- and Sergino Dest, a newcomer to the U.S. scene since choosing to rep the Yanks late last year. Dest cracked the Top 10 at right-back after a superb campaign with Ajax, a summer transfer saga with Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and an eventual move to the Spanish giants, where he became the first U.S. player to start in a Clasico, as well as the first American to score a goal for the storied club.\n\nBut enough preamble; here's how we did the list.\n\nTo compile the 2020 edition of the FC 100, 65 ESPN FC experts (from editors to writers, TV talent to former players) from around the world were given a list of about 250 players and managers to make their selections.\n\nHere's the key: We didn't use one megalist with all players mixed together -- such conceits inevitably favor attackers, because everyone loves a good goal, don't they? But that isn't fair to those engaged in the dark arts at the back. So instead, we broke down the world's best players by position in a 4-3-3 formation, plus manager. Each expert then contributed a Top 10 for each category, and we crunched the numbers and did a final review with a select few writers.\n\nAgree with our picks? Disagree? Now comes the fun part. FC 100: It. Is. On.\n\nNOTE: All player ages are as of Nov. 20\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe modern goalkeeper isn't just there to stop shots. He's also the first step in building attacks; whether with a long, accurate throw or a raking crossfield pass, it's the first major evolution for the position since the \"sweeper-keeper\" became a thing thanks to Manuel Neuer. Agility and reflexes are a given, but confidence, vision and assertive play are vital, too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Elaine Teng\n\nClub/country: Man United/Spain\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nDe Gea has been a constant through United's many ups and downs since he joined the club in 2011. He has faced a lot of criticism over the past nine years -- some fans think he should be dropped for 23-year-old Dean Henderson -- but De Gea is tied for the most Premier League clean sheets in United's history (112, shared with Peter Schmeichel) and made the second-most PL appearances (411) between the posts. Last season, only Liverpool and Manchester City conceded fewer goals, a huge part of why the Red Devils managed to finish third despite a poor start.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Between February and July, De Gea kept nine clean sheets -- the most in the league -- to help United go from seventh to third (and likely saving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's job at the same time).\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Slovenia\n\nAge: 36\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nLast season, Inter fell one point short of seizing the Serie A crown from Juventus and made it to the Europa League final. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez got much of the praise, but credit should also go to Handanovic's rock-solid performances between the posts. Inter conceded the fewest goals in the league, and their wily captain kept 13 clean sheets. At 36, his reflexes remain sharp, his presence imposing, and he's super adept at the full-stretch highlight save.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A superb save against Getafe's Nemanja Maksimovic helped Inter through to the Europa League quarterfinal and, ultimately, the final.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/Italy\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nConsider this: Donnarumma made his Serie A debut five years ago, has played over 200 games for Milan and is firmly established as the legendary Gianluigi Buffon's successor for Italy. And he's 21 years old. Despite his club's managerial chaos and financial turmoil, he has been a pillar of calm and consistency, keeping at least 10 clean sheets in each of his five seasons and steadily improving his passing accuracy. The Rossoneri are off to a flying start this term, and the sooner they can tie Donnarumma down -- his contract expires next summer -- the better their chances at long-term success.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the goals in Milan's 2-1 derby win over Inter, but Donnarumma made a key save against Romelu Lukaku in his first game back after testing positive for the coronavirus to cement their victory.\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Costa Rica\n\nAge: 33\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas doesn't get as much attention as many of his colleagues on this list, but that doesn't make him less deserving. At Real Madrid, his teammates used to call him \"Keylor Paras\" (\"Keylor Stops\"), and he's lived up to that name after moving to Paris. In his first season at PSG, he kept five clean sheets -- trailing Bayern's Manuel Neuer by just one despite playing 191 fewer minutes -- to guide his team to the Champions League final. In terms of European success, few can usurp him: He has played in four of the past five Champions League finals -- and won three of them.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Making save after save against Atalanta in the Champions League quarterfinal to keep PSG's hopes alive before Neymar & Co. orchestrated a dramatic late comeback.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nAt his best, Ederson can feel like an extra outfield player who also happens to be fantastic at stopping shots. The perfect keeper for Pep Guardiola's brand of possession-based football, his scarily accurate long balls start many a City attack. City have struggled with injuries and have been uncharacteristically fragile at the back, but last season Ederson still managed to keep 16 clean sheets, earning him the Premier League Golden Glove. As they look to wrest the league title back from Liverpool, City will need him at his best on both offense and defense.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Raheem Sterling scored the winner against Arsenal in October, but Ederson made spectacular saves to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka to get City back on track.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nReal Madrid didn't always look as though they would win the league last season, but Courtois was a giant in goal. He conceded 20 goals in 34 league matches, kept 18 clean sheets and boasted the highest save percentage in La Liga. But he has been known for making some outrageous gaffes now and again. In November, during a Nations League match against Denmark, the Belgian No. 1 let a back pass roll straight past him into goal. If Belgium, the top-ranked team in the world, are to win the Euros next year, Courtois will need all of his focus.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his first La Liga title with Real Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Germany\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nIn September 2019, Ter Stegen rushed out of the penalty area, beat a Getafe attacker to the ball and played a long pass into the opposite box for Luis Suarez to calmly lob into the goal. That assist was classic Ter Stegen, a confident sweeper-keeper who's comfortable with the ball at his feet and can convert saves into counterattacks in a flash. The German doesn't get as much attention in a team full of attacking superstars, but he plays a pivotal role in Ronald Koeman's plans as he looks to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Claiming his second career assist in December 2019, when Antoine Griezmann ran onto his goal kick to score against Mallorca.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/Slovenia\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nIn the six seasons Oblak has tended the Atletico goal, they've conceded fewer than 30 goals each campaign. The efficient, reserved Slovenian is the perfect keeper for Diego Simeone's hardworking, disciplined side. He made nine saves -- more than any keeper in the tournament -- in a man-of-the-match performance away at Liverpool in last season's Champions League to send Atletico through to the quarterfinals. There are more glamorous players in football, but few are as consistent or as effective.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool had 72% possession and 34 shots at the Wanda Metropolitano in March, but they couldn't get past Oblak.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe consummate modern goalkeeper, Alisson can turn defense into offense in the blink of an eye. Equally calm on the ball with his hands and his feet, he was instrumental in Liverpool's charge to their first Premier League trophy in three decades. In January, he even notched an assist when he played a long upfield pass to Mohamed Salah, who made it 2-0 against Manchester United. (Alisson was so delighted he sprinted the length of the pitch, past all of his teammates, to celebrate with the Egypt international.) Liverpool's long injury list this season, especially in central defense, means Alisson is more crucial to their hopes of retaining the title than ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helping Liverpool end their 30-year wait for a Premier League title.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Neuer and Alisson finished tied on overall points after the tallying of ballots, but Neuer was awarded first place by virtue of receiving more first-place votes from the FC voters, with 19 to Alisson's 18.\n\nGermany's sweeper-keeper looked to be slowing down as he reached his mid-30s, but in the past 12 months, the 34-year-old has been back at his imperious best. Seven years since he most recently won a treble with Bayern, Neuer lifted the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies in 2020 as club captain. He made a string of crucial stops in the Champions League final to deny PSG, including a spectacular double save against Neymar. In October, he kept his 200th clean sheet for Bayern, a club record. At times it seems attackers are intimidated just knowing he's in goal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his second Champions League title, though an eighth consecutive Bundesliga trophy is no small feat, either.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nRIGHT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nAt one point, right-backs were considered the least skilled players on the pitch, but the next generation brings boldness and unpredictability. Positional awareness, pinpoint crossing and breakneck pace separate the best from the rest.\n\nPlayer capsules by Stephan Uersfeld\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/United States\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nIt's been an incredible year for the young defender. After just one season and 23 appearances for Ajax's first team since debuting in July 2019, Dest has been on a dizzying upward trajectory, becoming the first American to sign for La Liga giants Barcelona after being involved in a transfer saga that also included Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Not the worst options! The Dutch-born player, capable of playing either full-back position, is considered one of the best young U.S. internationals since committing in October 2019, and he has already shown in four appearances for Barca that he can solve their issues at right-back.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Starting the Clasico, becoming the first American to feature in Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, and even winning Barca's man-of-the-match award in the 3-1 defeat.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nNow in his second La Liga season with Atleti, Trippier has fully embraced his new life away from Tottenham and the Premier League. He's an integral part of Diego Simeone's first XI and has started and finished every match of the 2020-21 season. Playing at right-back at the club level, he's versatile enough to play a more advanced role for England, featuring as a wing-back in Gareth Southgate's 3-4-2-1 formation. Though England have a lot of competition for full-back spots, Trippier's experience, work rate and pinpoint accuracy with crosses could be crucial in the Three Lions' bid to compete at the Euros in the summer.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Trippier's best moment came in a \"return\" to England. In one of the last big matches played in front of fans before the coronavirus shut down the sport, Trippier was instrumental in Atletico's 3-2 win at Liverpool back in March, ably shutting Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson down before coming off in extra time.\n\nClub/country: Leicester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe dynamic defender started all but one of Leicester's 29 Premier League matches before the pandemic, but we're still waiting to see him back in action. His absence due to an ACL injury has been a major challenge for the Foxes, who have missed Pereira's pace and poise on the flank. Before that, Pereira had been involved in 471 duels, more than any other defender across the top five leagues in Europe. Without Pereira, Leicester dropped out of the Champions League spots at the end of the 2019-20 season, proof of his importance to Brendan Rodgers' plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's rare for defenders to show up on the scoresheet, but Pereira put together a superb game against West Ham in January, notching a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Netherlands\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThriving in his role at wing-back for Atalanta, Hateboer was an integral part of one of Europe's most exciting teams last term as the unheralded Italian side came within a late PSG goal of reaching the Champions League semifinals. A force in aerial duels and his side's intricate passing game, he pairs a superhuman work rate with positional intelligence in a demanding position. The 26-year-old was snapped up by Atalanta from Dutch side Groningen for less than a million euros in 2017 and has since become a fixture in the Dutch national team. There's every chance he'll take another step up next summer and move to one of the European giants.\n\nHigh point of 2020: An impressive two-goal performance in the Champions League round of 16, first leg, against Valencia. Not only was it his only game with goals in 2019-20 but it put the tiny Serie A side into the Champions League's last eight in Lisbon.\n\nplay 0:57 Is FC 100 winner Mane the smartest player at Liverpool? Gab Marcotti believes Sadio Mane \"smartness\" is one of the reasons he tops ESPN's FC 100.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Spain\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas didn't hold back his tears when Sevilla won the 2019-20 Europa League in Germany this summer. Having begun his senior career at the club in 2003, winning two UEFA Cups and two Copa del Reys, clinching the Europa League at age 34 was seen as just reward for the Spain international. Indeed, he seemingly has gotten better with age since leaving Manchester City for his boyhood club in 2017.\n\nHigh point of 2020: As team captain, Navas contributed an assist against Inter Milan in the final as Sevilla won the competition for the sixth time since 2005.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nA reliable defender under Pep Guardiola, Walker might not have the attacking power of Trent Alexander-Arnold or Achraf Hakimi, for example, but he's been one of the steadier City performers since joining the club in 2017. On the pitch, he patrols City's right side with high tempo, physicality and an unrivalled intensity. In his 30s and with an apparent leadership void in the City squad since Vincent Kompany's exit, Walker has been a vital lieutenant for Guardiola.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner -- but not celebrating it! -- against one of his former clubs, Sheffield United, in his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nIt's hard to find anyone more consistent at right-back over the past couple of years. He has fended off the threat of losing his place in Madrid's first XI with another outstanding season, looking so good that his presumed replacement, Achraf Hakimi, returned from a loan at Borussia Dortmund only to be sold to Inter Milan. Carvajal isn't a flashy right-back, known more for his work behind the ball, but he's also been a superb support to Karim Benzema whenever he's able to get forward and play crosses into the box. Carvajal was a part of the Real side that won La Liga for the first time since 2016-17, and despite his missing the start of the campaign through injury, his imminent return will boost Zinedine Zidane's squad immensely.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was superb in both Clasico clashes last season, results that played a key role in Real Madrid's title challenge.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPavard is still far from being a household name, though the young defender was arguably Bayern Munich's unsung hero of a Treble-winning season. Having joined from relegated VfB Stuttgart in 2019, he provided the stability at right-back that allowed Joshua Kimmich to move into a permanent defensive midfield role. Less attacking than some of his Bundesliga right-back peers like Hakimi, he still scored four goals and set up seven in all competitions in his debut season at the Allianz Arena. The \u20ac35 million transfer fee for the France defender looks to be a bargain even though his unspectacular style of play gets him few plaudits. Oh, and Pavard is also capable of putting in a shift at centre-back to further enhance Bayern's myriad options.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In his first league match under Hansi Flick, Pavard was superb, notching an assist as Bayern demolished Borussia Dortmund 4-0 midway through last season.\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Morocco\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nA spectacular, adventurous two-way player capable of brilliance on either side of the ball, Hakimi has fast become one of the best right-backs in world soccer. After scoring six goals and providing six assists for Dortmund last season and forming a superb relationship with England star Jadon Sancho while on loan in the Bundesliga, Hakimi joined Inter Milan this summer and has continued to entertain on the wing. One of the fastest defenders in the game, his sloppy passes have caused headaches for teammates at times, though he is always quick to make up for mistakes with attacking contributions.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Down 2-0 at half-time, Hakimi's brace in the Champions League group-stage match against Inter Milan turned around the tie for Dortmund (they went on to win 3-2).\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe kid from Liverpool is living the dream at Anfield. Liverpool followed up their remarkable Champions League win in 2018-19 with their first league title in 30 years, and Alexander-Arnold once again was vital to the Reds' success. The young defender, who was originally a midfielder in the Liverpool academy, continues to define, and redefine, what full-back play can be in the modern game. His set pieces are a constant threat, and his crosses cause havoc in the penalty area. The England international remains on the way up, but a muscle injury has curtailed his progress this season. That said, the future looks bright for a player who has won 77 of 101 Premier League appearances for his boyhood club.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notching two assists for Virgil van Dijk in the 2-1 win against Brighton in late November, both from set pieces. It was one of the key wins for Liverpool en route to their first-ever Premier League title.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRE-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nBeing a great central defender requires more than size, assertiveness and strength. Some of the modern greats are cultured in possession; others are the epitome of no-nonsense force. The best central defenders combine timing and power with elegance and poise under pressure.\n\nPlayer capsules by Tom Hamilton\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Brazil\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nThe PSG defender was at the forefront of the Ligue 1 champions' journey to the Champions League final in 2019-20. His versatility means PSG boss Thomas Tuchel sometimes uses him in the heart of their midfield, but that has been a bone of contention, with sporting director Leonardo keen to see Marquinhos at centre-back. Wherever he plays, the Brazilian is influential. He's seen as the long-term successor for Thiago Silva, who left for Chelsea in the summer, and is not afraid to speak his mind when asked for his opinion. This made him the perfect candidate to be PSG's new captain, with the club's former defender Jean-Marc Pilorget describing Marquinhos as \"unflappable on the field.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Superb in PSG's Champions League campaign, scoring two key goals against Atalanta and RB Leipzig to help the side into the final.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nRated as one of the world's best young centre-backs, Kounde's brilliant season led to a \"magnificent\" transfer offer from Manchester City, according to Monchi, the club's sporting director. Monchi later praised Kounde's response to the rejected bid, saying he displayed \"professional and respectful behaviour.\" City eventually went for Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias, but Manchester United are also interested in the man who now has his sights on supplanting Raphael Varane and Dayot Upamecano with the France national team. Having moved to Sevilla from Bordeaux for \u00a322.5m ahead of the 2019-20 season, he's since helped them to the Europa League title last season and is an important figure in their Champions League aspirations this term.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Had plenty of eye-catching performances last season, but was singularly magnificent in their quarterfinal win over Wolves in the Europa League.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Netherland\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe Dutch centre-back completed his big-money, \u20ac75 million move to Juventus ahead of the 2019-20 campaign and, in doing so, followed in the footsteps of his idols, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. Initially, then-coach Maurizio Sarri planned to integrate him slowly, but Giorgio Chiellini's long-term injury saw the young defender thrust into the first team. He made a shaky start, but despite battling a shoulder injury in 2020-21, he's become an integral part of the Juventus defence. Juve's 2-0 win at Bologna in June was the match in which De Ligt really announced himself in Serie A. \"He was only born in 1999, and he has been catapulted into a new way of playing. He's smart,\" Chiellini said of De Ligt. The CIES Football Observatory ranks De Ligt as the most valuable central defender in the world, putting his current value at an eye-watering \u20ac105m.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Neatly summed up in his performance against Lyon in the final 16 of the Champions League when he battled on despite having his head cut open early in the match.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/France\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nLaporte's importance at Manchester City is perhaps best illustrated by his absence. There's a popular school of thought that if Laporte hadn't suffered a knee injury that ruled him out for four months, the Premier League title race would have been far closer last season. \"We have missed him a lot; he's the best left central defender in the world,\" City boss Pep Guardiola said of Laporte. \"Imagine the best teams in the world lose their best central defender. He is fast, strong in the air.\" Laporte is one half of a formidable partnership at the back for City alongside new signing Ruben Dias, and they will form the foundations for another push for trophies. Laporte is still waiting to make his debut for the French national team, such are Didier Deschamps' embarrassment of riches for France, but it's a matter of when, not if.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Simply seeing him back in action after a long layoff. Laporte is so important to City that Guardiola had to warn against his return back in January being seen as the single answer to solving all of their defensive worries.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nYet another French international on the list, Varane is one-half of Real Madrid's formidable partnership alongside Sergio Ramos, though the 27-year-old has endured a mixed 2020. He was indispensable in Real's watertight rear guard en route to the league title, with Los Blancos conceding just six in 11 games after the restart, and Varane's friends and teammates, like France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, aren't concerned. \"He is a great champion above all else,\" Lloris said. \"He has great experience. He is a leader in our team.\" And his Real Madrid teammate Eden Hazard has also been impressed: \"I've come across some fantastic defenders during my career, such as John Terry and Vincent Kompany. I think that although [Varane] is still young, he's already one of the best centre-backs of all time.\" Despite questions over his form -- he still ranks fourth in Europe's big five leagues for aerial defensive duels won this season -- he always fronts up, takes responsibility and seeks improvement.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 32 league games as Real clinched their first La Liga crown since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: RB Leipzig/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe young Frenchman has been linked with just about every European giant after another strong season, with Manchester United and Bayern Munich reportedly at the front of the queue. \"As for the future, I'm not sure [if Upamecano will stay] as he is very talented,\" Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann told ESPN. \"Lots of clubs will want to buy him -- perhaps next season, it could be real that he leaves the club.\" Even though he's just 22, Upamecano plays with authority at the back, unafraid to carry the ball out of defence but also positionally aware to know when to take a safer option. Alongside Kounde, Kurt Zouma and Aymeric Laporte, he's one of a number of brilliant defenders at France boss Didier Deschamps' disposal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In a season when RB Leipzig got to the semifinals of the Champions League, he was at his commanding best in their quarterfinal win against Atletico Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Napoli/Senegal\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThere's not a transfer window that goes by without a handful of the European giants being linked with the Napoli defender. The latest team to chase the 6-foot-5 Senegal international was PSG in the summer, but Napoli were resolute in rejecting any offers that fell short of their \u20ac75m asking price. \"I had no doubts, he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role,\" Napoli boss Gennaro Gattuso said in September of Koulibaly. He's now his national team's captain and was rated by ex-Spain goalkeeper Pepe Reina as the best centre-back he's played behind. The future remains uncertain for Koulibaly with a number of teams forever linked with him -- Liverpool could go back in for him amid their defensive injury crisis -- but for now, he is indispensable to Napoli.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Though Napoli finished second to Juventus again in the league, Koulibaly was superb in the Coppa Italia final as his side bested the league champions on penalties.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Austria\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 2 (left-back)\n\nWhat can you say about one of the most versatile defenders in the modern game? Alaba started last season at left-back under previous coach Niko Kovac, only to finish it as a triple-winning centre-back. The Austrian player's contract is up at the end of the season, and Bayern Munich are bracing for his exit -- expect the likes of Liverpool to be interested. Bayern manager Hansi Flick says Alaba \"holds the defence together,\" while Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in August likened Alaba's impact at centre back to the transformational qualities of Franz Beckenbauer. \"We haven't had a 'chief' in defence for some time now, one who really takes the reins in hand and sets the tone there and simply acts as the head of the defensive unit -- he did that,\" Rummenigge said.\n\nHigh point of 2020: There were numerous standout moments for Alaba, but the past 12 months will be remembered as the time Bayern Munich swept all before them, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nThe Real Madrid talisman continues to be a polarising figure, but love him or hate him, he is a truly remarkable player. His Real teammate Toni Kroos calls him the \"absolute captain\" and the \"best you can have.\" Despite his age, Ramos would still walk into most sides and will be a top free agent if he opts against extending his stay at Real Madrid after this season. In the meantime, he continues to set records, having passed the 100-goal mark for Los Blancos and also set a record with his 45th El Clasico appearance when Real Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in late October. Ramos is still indispensable for Spain at the international level, too, with Luis Enrique calling him a \"unique, different level\" defender, and he recently set a record there as well, with his 177th Spain cap against Germany, the most appearances at international level for anyone in the men's game in Europe.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Los Blancos supporters will remember his key penalties in Real's back-to-back 1-0 wins over Getafe and Athletic Bilbao in July, as they continued their charge to the 2019-20 La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Netherlands\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nIt's testament to Van Dijk that when he suffered his season-ending injury against Everton in October, the mood around Liverpool changed. Gigi Wijnaldum said that the squad had suffered \"sleepless nights,\" while Jurgen Klopp admits Van Dijk is irreplaceable. \"Every team in the world would miss Virgil van Dijk,\" Klopp said soon after his injury. \"He is the best in the world.\" Up to that injury, the Dutch international had missed just one Premier League game for Liverpool after signing from Southampton for \u00a375m in January 2018.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing every single minute (and scoring five goals) in Liverpool's 2019-20 Premier League-winning season, the club's first league title in 30 years. Need we say more?\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nLEFT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nTop left-backs are as comfortable locking down an opposing winger as they are turning into one when their teams are in possession. Some aren't even left-footed, using their positional awareness to drift infield and be another central defender or midfielder if needed.\n\nIn the modern era, no positions touch the ball more than full-back, making the best of them simply indispensable.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 7\n\nMendy established himself as Real Madrid's undisputed first-choice left-back this year after coach Zinedine Zidane requested his signing in the summer of 2019. In the biggest games, against Barcelona in La Liga or Manchester City in the Champions League, Mendy -- not Marcelo -- gets the nod. Mendy might lack his teammate's eye-catching skills, but he offers a defensive solidity that helped the team keep clean sheet after clean sheet post-lockdown. He's no slouch going forward, either.\n\nHigh point of 2020: His only goal for the club so far, a thunderous near-post finish against Granada as Real Madrid closed in on the La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nMarcelo's reputation and history -- and Real Madrid's title win -- see him make this list even though, by his own standards, he had a disappointing year. The 32-year-old started fewer than half of Real Madrid's games in 2019-20, and the defensive lapses that have made him an occasional liability during a hugely successful club career became increasingly common. Since Zinedine Zidane returned for his second spell in charge, in 2019, Madrid have lost nine league games, and Marcelo started all of them. No one doubts his talent and personality, though, and on his day, there are few footballers who are more fun to watch.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his fifth league title in 14 years as a Real Madrid player.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/England\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nChilwell was an important part of Leicester City's impressive 2019-20 campaign, and his August move to Chelsea -- after a drawn-out transfer saga that saw Leicester demand a world-record fee for a defender before accepting \"only\" \u00a350m -- cemented his status as one of English football's best young players. Wasting no time at Stamford Bridge, Chilwell provided a goal and assist on his Premier League debut. Coach Frank Lampard says he's \"fantastic,\" praising Chilwell's \"ability to be so high up the pitch when you want him.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: A glorious 90th-minute goal vs. Watford in Leicester's first game back in June, which was somewhat spoiled by Watford equalising three minutes later.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/France\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThis has been a year of rediscovery for the young Frenchman as he finally started to resemble the powerful, expansive full-back it was hoped he'd become when he graduated from the Atletico Madrid academy alongside his older brother, Lucas. Hernandez excelled on loan at Alaves in 2016-17, looked out of his depth at Real Madrid in 2017-18 and was decidedly average at Real Sociedad in 2018-19. At Milan, though, he's been a revelation. Hernandez scored six goals in Serie A last season, with Opta rating him as the best left-back in Italy.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A crisp, volleyed finish in a 3-2 win over Udinese in January.\n\nClub/country: Tottenham/Spain\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nArguably the best full-back in La Liga last season, Reguilon was a blur of constant movement on the left flank of Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla team as they cruised to a top-four league finish and won the Europa League. But, remarkably, Real Madrid chose to cash in, selling him to Tottenham off the back of that impressive loan. It's true that Real have a buyback clause, but why wait for a season or two? Reguilon is good enough to be starting for Real Madrid right now. In the meantime, he's become an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Spurs side, one that has a very real shot at winning the Premier League.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning the Europa League in his last game for Sevilla.\n\nClub/country: Borussia Dortmund/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGuerreiro doesn't attract the headlines of others on this list -- or of some high-profile teammates at Dortmund -- but he quietly had the best season of his career in 2019-20. Coach Lucien Favre's tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation helped enormously, enabling Guerreiro to operate in the wing-back role to which he is best suited while minimising the defects that hold him back as a pure full-back or winger. A well-rounded player, he contributed an impressive eight goals to Dortmund's second-placed Bundesliga finish. At 26, he's approaching his peak, and chose to sign a new deal in October 2019 despite reported interest from Barcelona and PSG.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring twice in Dortmund's 4-0 derby win over Schalke in May.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Brazil\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nTaking fourth place in our list for the fourth year in a row suggests Sandro is consistency personified. Into his sixth season at Juventus and soon to turn 30, he remains one of the most reliable performers in world football in his position. (Juventus were so excited about signing him in 2015 that they published a glowing story on the team website about his myriad qualities.) Sandro isn't quite as dangerous going forward as you might expect, though there aren't any real weaknesses to his game. Brazilian great Roberto Carlos said in 2015 that Sandro was his true \"successor,\" and few can argue with his assessment.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored Juventus' third goal in a 3-3 roller-coaster draw with Sassuolo, then cleared a potential winner off the line.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Spain\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nAlba is past his peak and looks to have been left behind by Spain at the international level, but he's still Barcelona's undisputed first-choice left-back. His link-ups with Lionel Messi -- once one of the most fruitful attacking partnerships in football -- remain dangerous, albeit less frequent. Alba has set up three goals this season under new coach Ronald Koeman. His defensive failings are well known, and unlikely to change at this stage. Barcelona have tried to prepare for life after Alba -- the Spain international will be 32 in March -- but Lucas Digne and Junior Firpo have already failed to supplant him at the Camp Nou.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Whatever it was, it wasn't Barca's 8-2 defeat to Bayern.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Canada\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nDavies' emergence as a world-class player has been thrilling to watch. Take his assist in Bayern's 8-2 Champions League demolition of Barcelona, when he evaded Lionel Messi, left Arturo Vidal on the floor and flummoxed Nelson Semedo before cutting the ball back for Joshua Kimmich to tap in. Was there a more memorable setup in 2020? \"I was almost ashamed of how happy I was after scoring, because it was 99% his goal,\" Kimmich said afterward, and it was hard to disagree.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That assist, obviously, though winning a domestic/European Treble with Bayern was also extremely special.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Scotland\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThis year's title win, ending Liverpool's 30-year wait, was the culmination of a remarkable journey for Robertson. In three years at Anfield, he's gone from Premier League prospect to, quite simply, the best left-back in the world. It almost seems wrong to call him \"left-back\" given how prolific he is in attack, racking up 23 assists in the past two Premier League seasons from a defensive position. In terms of creating chances, taking set pieces and working tirelessly off the ball, he is a cut above. He racked up his 100th Premier League appearance for the club, and the \u00a310m that Liverpool spent on Robertson in 2017 from Hull City increasingly looks like one of the best bits of transfer business ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool won the league. You might have heard about it.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRAL MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe key to playing central midfield is a good sense of rhythm: knowing when to speed up in transition and when to slow the pace. There are many forms, too: the tough tackler, box-to-box machine and the nimble playmaker. It's about seeing the whole field -- and exploiting it.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Italy\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nIt has been a stop-start year for most players amid the coronavirus pandemic, but especially for Verratti. The French league decided to curtail the 2019-20 season in March, and when PSG eventually returned to competitive action in the French Cup final and Champions League in the summer, Verratti was injured. He reappeared as a substitute in the CL semifinal win over RB Leipzig before featuring for 25 minutes in the final against Bayern. However, while staying fit remains a problem, his absences from Thomas Tuchel's side serve only to highlight his importance. PSG are a different side with pass-master Verratti in their midfield, and he's also playing a big role in the rejuvenation of the Italian national team under Roberto Mancini.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Completing a domestic Treble with PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Croatia\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nModric might be in the twilight of his playing career, but he's still getting it done in one of the most demanding midfields and for one of the most demanding fan bases. The Croatian midfielder's ability on the ball and his vision of the game have always been his strong suit. It's how he casually guided Croatia to the World Cup final in 2018 and picked up the Ballon d'Or -- the first player not named Messi or Ronaldo to win it since 2007 -- in the same year. That's why Zinedine Zidane still trusts him to deliver at the highest level.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored his first-ever El Clasico goal last season as Real surged to the title at their rivals' expense.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Netherlands\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThe Dutch midfielder was the poster boy of European football when he joined Barca from Ajax for \u20ac70 million in 2019, but his first season in Spain showed him that not everything is always rosy in football. After excelling as the deepest midfielder at Ajax, he is playing a more attacking role under first Ernesto Valverde and later Quique Setien in Spain. Despite being moved around and having to adapt to a new country and a new language, De Jong showed glimpses of his talent, and there are signs of improvement in his second season at the club. Under his third coach at Camp Nou -- his compatriot Ronald Koeman -- he looks more comfortable in a \"double pivot\" (a pair of deep-lying midfielders who shield the defense and share creative responsibilities), and Barca hope he can rule their midfield for the next decade.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Has played every minute for Barcelona in La Liga this season.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nThe Brazilian won the Champions League in his first season with Liverpool and the Premier League title in his second. Not bad, right? He has excelled for Jurgen Klopp's side at the base of the midfield as an imposing figure who also offers a touch of class on the ball. He was incredible in the 3-1 win over Manchester City in November 2019, opening the scoring. His versatility is increasingly important, too. He played as a full-back earlier in his career at Real Madrid and AS Monaco, but is just as comfortable slotting into central defense for the Reds after a serious injury to Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played 28 games in Liverpool's first-ever Premier League title win.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere are more glamorous players at Liverpool, but England international Henderson took the plaudits for his side's Premier League triumph last season. For his performances on the pitch, his influence as the club's captain and his work with the #playerstogether initiative during the coronavirus lockdown, he's finally getting the respect his career has demanded. Henderson is not a highlight-reel player at the base of the Reds' midfield, but his hard work, unfussy style of play and passionate captaincy remain essential to the Reds' success. He's never been a player who captures the imagination at Liverpool -- or anywhere, for that matter -- but there's a reason his is the first name Jurgen Klopp puts on the team sheet.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A Premier League title, anyone?\n\nplay 1:00 Laurens: Mbappe will dominate for the next 10 years Julien Laurens believes Kylian Mbappe will be the next generational player once Messi and Ronaldo retire.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/France\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nEden Hazard once said that Kante is so good that he plays like two men in midfield, and who can argue? Understated and always willing to let more talented teammates get the glory, Kante is the perfect pivot for club and country. Though injuries and a positional change under then-Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri reduced his effectiveness, there are signs under Frank Lampard that he is refinding his best form. Back at the base of the midfield and with a stellar attack ahead of him, his relentless work in winning the ball back and distributing it could prove just as important as the goals and assists Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner contribute.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helped Chelsea to finish runner-up in the FA Cup despite missing much of the season through injury and concerns around COVID-19. Also passed 150 appearances for the club despite transfer interest from PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nTo classify Casemiro as a \"destroyer\" in midfield is to do the Brazil international a disservice. He offers much more to Madrid than just protection to the back four, and you could even argue he's become their most important player. When he doesn't play, Madrid struggle. He missed three league games last season, and Madrid won only one of them. Madrid conceded four at Valencia in November when he was absent with the coronavirus. He also has developed a knack for scoring important goals: twice in the 2-1 win against Sevilla last season, and the winner in the 1-0 victory at Espanyol as Madrid closed in on the league title. He was also on target against Borussia Monchengladbach in October as Zinedine Zidane's side came from behind to draw 2-2 in the Champions League. The other goal was scored by Karim Benzema, but guess who set it up? Casemiro.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games in the coronavirus-impacted La Liga season en route to the league title, his second since joining the club in 2013.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Germany\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nKroos is into his seventh season with Madrid and remains as important to Zinedine Zidane's side as ever. Take it from ZZ himself, who enjoys simply watching the German midfielder at practice. \"I love to watch Toni train,\" Zidane said. \"I love to be there for his training sessions. They're exceptional sessions. I'm not saying it for the sake of it. It's true. I've never seen him lose the ball. Well, maybe once. His game is always elegant and efficient. He never has a bad day.\" Even Pep Guardiola, who managed Kroos at Bayern Munich, raved about his former charge in a 2020 documentary: \"The players that shout the most are those that hide when things go badly. Toni is the opposite, he's the bravest of them all in the most difficult moments.\" Before last season, Kroos had won La Liga once, but his consistency in Madrid's 10-game winning run -- Casemiro said earlier this year that \"Real Madrid matches always go in Kroos' rhythm\" -- when football resumed in June helped Los Blancos end a three-year wait for the Spanish title.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games and adding several key assists on the way to Real's La Liga title, their first since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Spain\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThiago turned heads this summer when he signed for Liverpool, but it wasn't the transfer that shocked people; rather, it was the fact that other elite teams across Europe didn't put up a fight to sign him instead. Despite a string of challenging injuries throughout his career, Thiago has ability and creative skills that have never diminished. Even last season he missed the run-in in the Bundesliga, although before that he had been influential in Bayern's turnaround under Hansi Flick, and he returned in time for the Champions League knockout phase to exert his authority on the competition. At his best, he's a peerless deep-lying playmaker, perfect for unlocking packed defenses -- something Liverpool face often -- with a clever pass or swivel of the hips. He makes everything look so simple and was the best player on the pitch in the final in Lisbon -- completing 85 passes, more than any other player (Kimmich managed 78) -- as Bayern beat PSG to clinch the Treble.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Finishing his final season at Bayern in style, with a domestic/European Treble and, most notably, his first Champions League winners' medal since he got one with Barcelona in 2010-11.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 2 (right-back)\n\nKimmich is a coach's dream. Last season, he alternated effortlessly between the right-back and defensive midfield positions. He even filled in at centre-back occasionally, though coach Hansi Flick prefers him in midfield, especially since the sale of Thiago to Liverpool. For old time's sake, it was at right-back, with Benjamin Pavard returning from injury, where he took on the role of chief creator in Bayern's run to Champions League glory in the summer. He scored one and created four of his side's goals in the quarterfinal stage, including assisting the winner in the final for Kingsley Coman. Still just 25, he is Bayern's present and future.\n\nHigh point of 2020: He was instrumental in Bayern's first Champions League win since 2012-13, Jupp Heynckes' final season with the club.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nATTACKING MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe best attacking midfielders have a sense of mischief, capable of cracking a robust defensive set with improvisation or magic.

However, it's over only the past 12 months that he has really kicked on. He's a more mature, productive player on the pitch and, after helping Villa stay up on the final day of last season, he's started the new season in red-hot form for club and country. A midfielder who excels with the ball at his feet and who knows how to create space, it's not hard to understand why he's been linked to both Manchester United and Manchester City in 2020.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Grealish scored twice and set up three goals in Villa's extraordinary 7-2 win against Liverpool in October.\n\nClub/country: Lyon/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe Lyon side that reached the Champions League semifinal last season was brimming with talent, but the jewel in the Ligue 1 side's crown was undoubtedly Aouar. He tore apart Juventus and Manchester City in an advanced midfield role, setting up four of Lyon's five goals against the two European giants as they set up a final four meeting with eventual winners Bayern. A quick-footed creator with trickery in abundance, Aouar resisted a summer move to the Premier League, though it's just a matter of time until his skills enhance a bigger club and on a bigger stage.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Lyon to within 90 minutes of the Champions League final with a string of match-winning performances.\n\nClub/country: Man United/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nFew players divide opinion quite like Pogba. France teammate Antoine Griezmann told ESPN that Pogba is the \"most underrated player in the world,\" but not everyone would agree. He has arguably flattered to deceive since returning to Manchester United from Juventus for \u20ac100m in 2016 -- together, they've won just one League Cup and a Europa League in four seasons -- but the underlying feeling is that he is still one of the best box-to-box midfielders on his day. He is capable of the sublime, if he can stay fit. Last season was tainted by injuries -- he was restricted to 21 appearances, scoring just one goal -- but with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford and a settled XI under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the conditions are ripe for Pogba to show his best.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Setting up the crucial second goal after coming off the bench in a Champions League group stage win at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nSilva was not able to live up to his excellent 2018-19 campaign last season, but when on form, he remains one of Europe's most creative midfielders. Even so, he still managed to score six goals and record seven assists as Man City finished second in the Premier League in 2019-20. However, he didn't even make it off the bench as City were stunned by Lyon in the Champions League quarterfinal when the tournament resumed in August. His aim this season is to win his place back in the City XI by rediscovering the form that led coach Pep Guardiola to say: \"Right now, it's Bernardo and 10 more players.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notched a goal and an assist against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semifinals, putting City on course to win their only trophy of the 2019-20 season.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/Germany\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nChelsea have lacked a dominant playmaker from midfielder for years, but in signing Havertz, the No. 10 spot is secured for years to come. Havertz is mature beyond his years: as a 20-year-old last season, he steered Bayer Leverkusen to a fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga with 12 goals. He also scored in four out of five Europa League games as Leverkusen reached the final eight, where they lost to eventual runners-up Inter Milan. Many expect him to become one of the best players in the world, and he's already a regular under Frank Lampard at Chelsea, who was \"overwhelmed\" with his new signing's humility and quiet confidence upon arrival in England.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Leverkusen to the final eight of the Europa League was good, but a hat trick in a League Cup win over Barnsley was a nice moment early in his Chelsea career.\n\nplay 1:40 Klopp the FC 100's best boss after 'historic' season Gab Marcotti explains how Jurgen Klopp beat Hansi Flick to the FC 100 best manager award.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGoretzka's physical transformation since signing for Bayern from Schalke has mirrored the German club's rise back to the top of European football. The once-slender midfielder looks more like a bodybuilder than a soccer star these days, having put on a tremendous amount of muscle. The extra bulk has helped keep him healthy, and Bayern benefit from his resilience: He was integral in Bayern's dominant Treble-winning season, weighing in with eight goals and 11 assists. \"The day I was unveiled at Bayern, I said I'd like to assume a role of responsibility within the team,\" Goretzka said this summer, \"and I'm moving more in that direction now. Maybe also imposing myself a bit more as I've got physically stronger. And that's a development I'm pleased with.\" Aggressive without being reckless and assertive without racking up yellow and red cards, Goretzka is, as former RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick puts it, \"the best box-to-box player in the world.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played a big role in Bayern's Treble-winning season.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Argentina\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGomez is one of the great Atalanta success stories. Plucked from Metalist Kharkiv for just \u00a34m in 2014, he's now regarded as one of the world's best midfielders. He even got a recall to the Argentina national team at the age of 32, three years after he won his fourth cap. He is arguably the frontman for this band of unfashionable players who have turned into European powerhouses under Gian Piero Gasperini. His record of seven goals and 16 assists in the Italian top flight belies his true influence: He is the conduit for his team's attack (a team that scored the most goals in the Italian top flight last season) and his form saw him named Serie A midfielder of the year.\n\nAs Atalanta captain, Gomez also played an important role in helping heal Bergamo. Atalanta's Lombardy region was hit hard by COVID-19 back in March, recording over 16,000 deaths because of the pandemic. Atalanta became a symbol of hope for that part of Italy, and their charge to the Champions League quarterfinals was as much for the region as it was for the players. During lockdown, Gomez used his social media platform to share \"life hacks\" such as how to repurpose plastic bottles, or offering indoor workout plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Returning to the Argentina national team after years without a call-up.\n\nClub/country: Manchester United/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nFernandes has been so good since signing for Manchester United for an initial fee of \u20ac55 million that it seems as though he's been there for years. In 14 Premier League appearances last season, he scored eight goals and created seven more, confirming that he could do in England what he'd done in Portugal, where he hit 20 goals in the Primeira Liga in 2018-19. Fernandes has done more of the same at the start of this season, with goals and match-winning performances against Brighton and Everton. He's not even been at Old Trafford for a year, but he's already United's talisman.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was instrumental in Man United's return to the Champions League and third-place finish in 2019-20.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNot only has Muller been one of the best players in the world over the past year, with his own unique sense of humour, but he's also one of the most entertaining. Muller was so good in the early 2010s they named a position after him -- the \"Raumdeuter\" (\"interpreter of space\") -- but the past season has been a seesaw of emotions. He started the 2019-20 season exiled under previous Bayern boss Niko Kovac and was contemplating leaving, but when Hansi Flick took charge, he put Muller slap-bang in the middle of his attacking lineup and Muller delivered. He finished the most recent campaign with a record-breaking 21 assists in the Bundesliga and helped Bayern deliver a remarkable Treble -- aided by his two goals in their 8-2 dismantling of Barcelona. His form has led to widespread calls for Joachim Low to bring him back in from the cold for Germany, but Low is still trying his best to ignore them.\n\nMuller has also provided us with a huge amount of enjoyment off the pitch. His social media account is wonderfully personable, and his impression of the Road Runner in describing Alphonso Davies' pace was brilliant. And he has now offered a second word into the football lexicon, with \"Lewan-goal-ski\" now alongside his very own position, even though he's not sure whether the definition fits his style. \"I'm always on the prowl. But I'm also more than just a 'Raumdeuter.' My skills on the ball are also very good. But of course, my great strength is making runs with the right timing.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing an instrumental role in Bayern's three-trophy season.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nManchester City missed out on the title to Liverpool last season by an 18-point margin, but De Bruyne's work did not go unnoticed. In 35 Premier League appearances, he set up 20 goals for his teammates, matching the record for assists in a single season held by Arsenal great Thierry Henry. He also scored 13 goals for Pep Guardiola's side as they ended the season in second place. De Bruyne won't want to come second again, meaning his motor and creativity will be pivotal to City wrestling the title back from Merseyside.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Matching the Premier League's single-season assist record.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nWING\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nWingers still have a role to play in the modern era. Their pace and persistence on the flanks give their teams another angle of attack; their ability to cut infield and shoot adds a dimension too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nVinicius still feels more like a bundle of raw attributes -- pace, trickery -- than a fully formed player. He frustrates as often as he thrills, a view shared by his own Real Madrid teammates at times, as evidenced by Karim Benzema blasting Vinicius to another player while the Brazilian watched back in October. But when Real Madrid need a goal or a different dimension in attack, they turn to Vinicius. Half the time, even he doesn't look as if he knows what's going to happen next, but maybe that's the point. In a modern game that is so often defined by rigid tactical discipline, his unpredictability can be priceless.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the opening goal against Barcelona in El Clasico in March, a match that saw the title race start to tip in Real Madrid's favour.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nHazard called 2019-20 \"the worst season of my career\" and it's hard to argue. He was out of shape on his arrival at Real Madrid, and an ankle fracture in November followed by another in February meant Hazard was essentially an irrelevance in their title win. At least the campaign's delayed conclusion allowed him to recover in time to make some unremarkable late appearances. Serious questions have been asked about the wisdom of Madrid investing so much -- reportedly up to \u20ac160m -- in Hazard in 2019, especially when he would have been available for free a year later. No one doubts his world-class talent, though, and we might still see a player who was once the Premier League's best repeat that form in a Real Madrid shirt.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A stunning long-range goal against Huesca in October 2020 suggested that better things could be just around the corner.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Argentina\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nSevilla transfer guru Monchi rarely gets a deal wrong, but the bargain \u20ac15m signing of Ocampos from Marseille must rank among his best acquisitions ever. At that point, the Argentinian looked like a solid professional, albeit performing below the potential he'd shown as a youngster at River Plate, with underwhelming spells in Ligue 1 and Serie A. At Sevilla, he has developed into the best winger, and one of the most effective players in any position, in La Liga. His boundless reserves of energy are a perfect fit for Julen Lopetegui's exhausting, all-action brand of football. One game summed up his season: Not only did Ocampos score in Sevilla's 1-0 win over Eibar in July but he also went in goal when keeper Tomas Vaclik got injured, even making a crucial save in the ninth minute of added time.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's tempting to say the Europa League win, but let's face it: the brilliant madness of stand-in keeper Ocampos saving from actual Eibar keeper Dmitrovic (yes, really) in the 99th minute is hard to beat.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere was a cruel poetry to the manner of Paris Saint-Germain's 2020 Champions League final defeat. Having spent over a billion euros to get within touching distance of the trophy they crave above all others, they were denied by a headed goal from Coman -- one of their own, discarded youth products. Coman joined PSG at the age of 10 and became their youngest-ever debutant at 16 before deciding to continue his career elsewhere. Still improving and into his sixth season at Bayern, he has an experience beyond his years and a trophy cabinet to match.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner in a Champions League final against his former club.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/United States\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPulisic's first season in England might have ended on a sour note, with him looking distraught as he limped off with a hamstring injury in Chelsea's FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal, but that shouldn't obscure what had come before it. Pulisic did enough that day at Wembley -- and in the 2019-20 season as a whole -- to suggest that all the hype around the U.S. star is absolutely justified. Nine Premier League goals from 25 appearances was an impressive return for a wide player, and more than twice as many as he ever scored in a season at Borussia Dortmund, which suggests he's progressing nicely under coach Frank Lampard despite those injury problems.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That fifth-minute FA Cup final goal.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIndia's 16-year-old para-archer Sheetal Devi produced a sensational effort in the final of the women's individual compound event at the Asian Para Games to win the gold medal. What makes her achievement all the more astonishing is that Sheetal is the only current female international archer to shoot with her feet.\n\nThis was her third medal of the Games after she partnered Rakesh Kumar to win gold in the compound mixed team event and a silver in the women's doubles along with Sarita.\n\nSheetal won the final despite trailing after the first three ends. She was behind 28-29, 56-58 and 84-87 in the first three ends against Singapore's Alim Nur Syahidah. Needing almost perfect shots in the next two ends, Sheetal hit remarkable 10s in her next six shots to take the gold with a final score of 144-142.\n\nThe rise of Sheetal\n\nAccording to World Archery, Sheetal is the only current female international archer to shoot with her feet. Belonging to Loidhar village in Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir, Sheetal was born with Phocomelia, which is a rare congenital deformity in which the hands or feet are underdeveloped. Her sporting talent was discovered during a youth event organised by the Indian Army in her hometown in 2021. The coaches and the family tried to get a prosthetic arm, but it didn't fit.\n\nDespite being disappointed, Sheetal didn't give up. A medical assessment showed she had a strong upper body, which made it favourable for her to take up archery. She told the Indian Express that her strong upper body is due to the fact she used to climb trees using her legs and upper body.\n\n\"I never thought I could do archery,\" she told the World Archery website. She joined coach Kuldeep Kumar's academy and started winning medals at the national competitions.\n\n\"I took her to the national championships. She was excited and saw many para-archers with different disabilities. She quickly got really interested in the sport,\" Kumar said.\"I told her to come to the academy and see other people shooting. I took her to the national championships. She was excited and saw many para-archers with different disabilities,\" he added.\n\nTen, ten, ten! Perfect scores! Devi Sheetal shot six consecutive ten rings in the last two rounds at the final of Women's Ind. Compound and won her first individual gold medal of Asian Games.#Hangzhou #AsianParaGames #HangzhouAsianParaGames #4thAsianParaGames #Hangzhou2022APG... pic.twitter.com/CV40QHpAHm - The 4th Asian Para Games Hangzhou Official (@19thAGofficial) October 27, 2023\n\nIn fact, Sheetal competed in able-bodied events at the Under-18 level and won multiple medals. Earlier this year, Sheetal became the first female armless archer to win a medal at the World Para Archery Championships in Pilsen, Czech Republic. She claimed the silver medal after losing to Oznur Cure of Turkey in the final. When she was at the World Championships, she caught the eye of famous armless archer Matt Stutzman, who also helped her to perfect the technique.\n\nStutzman is a trailblazer in the para-archery, winning the silver medal at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. \"Matt was the first armless archer, and it was the first time I met him. I was very excited,\" Sheetal said to World Archery.\n\n\"I want her to be successful,\" Stutzman said. \"She wants to win really bad. It's good she came because we can help her out.\"",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAs the Asian Games comes to an end after 14 days of medals, record-breaking numbers, and historic firsts for Indian sport, it's time to look in the rearview mirror.\n\nSome athletes exceeded expectations, some won expected golds and some other took home stunning bronze that shine just as bright while a few even punched above their weight.\n\nWhen watching 14 days of non-stop, multi-sport action, it's easy to forget some of the most standout moments that may or may not have been medals. So, here's our attempt to recap the Asiad via moments we simply didn't expect to happen. The good, the great, the brilliant and even some bizarre moments for Indian sport.\n\nHere are the Indian moments at Asian Games we did not see coming:\n\nIss baar sau paar - This time more than 100\n\nA confession right at the onset - the target of 100 medals seemed a little audacious when this ad slogan was released by the broadcasters. Only three other countries had won 100 medals or more in a single edition of the Asian Games before this - China, Japan, and South Korea. India certainly had the ability, but a lot of moving parts had to fall in place for this.\n\n107: Beyond the record stat, a collection of inspiring stories\n\nIndia's athletes stepped up and how, confirming 100 medals even before the final day's play and finished with an unprecedented 107 medals in Hangzhou. This was more than a 50% increase from the 2018 edition.\n\nP.S. There were questions over team medals in shooting being (based on cumulative qualification score, not there last time) but those were about 10-odd. This haul should be completely attributed to the athletes and their effort, the technicalities take nothing away from the feat.\n\nMukherjee magic\n\nTo beat China in China in a sport dominated by China, there are few adjectives that can accurately capture what a mind-blowing result that was; and that's what Sutirtha Mukherjee and Ayhika Mukherjee did. They pulled off one of the great wins in Indian sporting history beating China's world no. 2 Chen Meng and world no. 4 Wang Yidi in a sensational quarterfinal.\n\nThis is so good to see \u2764\ufe0f (via revolve_around_sun/IG) pic.twitter.com/8CSxPT4xFY - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 7, 2023\n\nIt was India's only third Asian Games medal in the sport, and first in women's doubles.\n\nAn Indian going beyond Neeraj?\n\nNeeraj Chopra is the reigning Olympic and World champion - not something Indian fans get to say often. So, for someone to have him topped him early in a major final, and for that to be a fellow Indian who was throwing his personal best was surreal and special.\n\nNeeraj wins gold, Kishore silver; their 'battle' wins hearts and minds\n\nThat's exactly what Kishore Kumar Jena did, topping Neeraj on the charts briefly. Of course, Neeraj bounced back with an 88.88 and defended his gold. As Jena said afterward, \"Pata tha bhaisaab kar lenge'.\n\nP.S. Neeraj's first throw may have been much bigger, but it was not counted because of some unexplained official error. The sorry level of officiating in athletics was another thing we didn't expect to see at this level. Jyothi Yarraji was wrongly disqualified for a false start and Jena's throw was wrongly called foul too.\n\nJyothi Yarraji wins silver in 100m hurdles after dramatic 'disqualification'\n\nParul Choudhary's final burst\n\nOn Monday, Parul won a steeplechase silver, behind only the world champion. About 24 hours later, she was back on the track running the women's 5000m. A gruelling schedule. No athlete had medalled in both these events together before at the Asian Games. But Parul went ahead and did it.\n\nWith stunning last-gasp win, double medallist Parul Chaudhary creates Asian Games history\n\nAnd it's the manner in which she did it... The sight of her overtaking Ririka Hironaka, who was checking for competition on the right, unseen from the left was the stuff movie climax sequences are made of.\n\nIndian volleyball team balling\n\nEven before the Asian Games officially began, one Indian team was quietly flipping the script in Hangzhou.\n\nThe Indian men's volleyball team went there with little to no expectation, what hope could a team forced to fund their travel while pawning their family jewellery a few years back could have?\n\nIndia's volleyball team beat silver and bronze holders in unlikely winning run\n\nYet they pulled off an unlikely run defeating two higher ranked sides, teams who had won silver and bronze the last time, to show what they were capable of. They finished sixth overall but gave a very good account of themselves.\n\nIndia medalling in every athletics event one evening\n\nOne Sunday evening, if you opened the schedule and results tab on the official website, you'd see the Indian flag next to every medal event in the evening session.\n\nTajinderpal Singh Toor - defends gold in shot put\n\nAvinash Sable - dominated steeplechase with a Bolt-like lookback moment\n\nJyothi Yarraji - overcomes bad officiating to win a hurdles silver\n\nSeema Punia - wins her third discus medal at 40 years of age\n\nIndia medal in every athletics final at the #AsianGames today \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/1iCZmKhkSp - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 1, 2023\n\nIndia has usually done well in athletics at the Asian Games, but this kind of churn in one session was amazing.\n\nAnant Jeet Singh Naruka's incredible skeet final\n\nImagine a 25-year-old old shooter in his first Asian Games facing off against a 60-year-old veteran of the sport who was winning World Championships the year you were born? And then imagine keeping pace with this legend for 80% of the final.\n\nThe Indian finished with a silver in the end as the Kuwait won gold with a perfect 60/60. It was an incredible final on a day India had medalled in two other shooting finals, which perhaps pushed Naruka a bit under the radar. But it was an extraordinary effort from the youngster.\n\nCompound domination\n\nWhen was the last time India dominated an event so thoroughly at the Asian Games that they won every single gold on offer? Compound archery was that rare clean sweep for India in Hangzhou, winning five out of the five gold medals in offer, plus one silver and a bronze.\n\n5/5: Compound archers pull off gold medal sweep, now over to the system to back them\n\nIndia has four reigning world champions in compound but not many have heard of them or support them because it's not an Olympic discipline. But those constant perfect bullseyes from three-gold winners Ojas Deotale and Jyothi Surekha Vennam should help bring in the spotlight now.\n\nThe Kabaddi Kerfuffle\n\nA game review that takes longer than the actual match. A sit-down protest in the middle of a major final with players refusing to follow the referee's decision. Officials who are unsure what the actual rules are, changing their calls and deciding whether to follow the international code or that of the Indian league.\n\nIndia win men's kabaddi gold after controversial final against Iran involving one hour stoppage\n\nThe kerfuffle in the men's kabaddi final between India and Iran is not something seen at major competitions, and hopefully something we don't see ever again. This was an overall mess and takes away the shine from India reclaiming the gold they had lost the last time around.\n\nSift, Palak dominating finals\n\nThat Indian shooting would do well at the Asian Games was expected. That they would win team medals which show the depth and consistency, was also known. What still came as a surprise though was how dominant some of these gold medals were.\n\nSift Kaur Samra, 22, became India's first individual gold medallist in Hangzhou with one of the most commanding performances seen in a 50m rifle 3 positions final; finishing a whopping 7.3 points ahead of the silver medallist, just the reigning world champion, Zhang Qiongyue of China.\n\nSift Kaur Samra: Once med student, now world-record gold medallist at Asian Games\n\nPalak Gulia, all of 17, shot an Asian Games record score of 242.1 in women's 10m air pistol, ahead of 18-year-old compatriot Esha Singh to ensure a double-podium for India.\n\n'She has a great stability of mind' - how teenager Esha Singh thrived under chaos to clinch silver\n\nMedals in wushu, roller-skating, sepaktakraw, bridge\n\nThese sports fly under the radar because of how rarely we see them and partly because they are not exactly Indian strongholds. But these sports played a major role in the 100-medal mark.\n\nSpecial shout out to Roshibina Devi Naorem, who won a silver despite personal setbacks such as the unrest back home in Manipur and the absence of her colleagues because China does not issue a standard visa to Arunachal Pradesh citizens.\n\nAfter personal setbacks, Manipuri wushu medallist Roshibina's cloud finally has a silver lining\n\nHonourable mentions",

They've come from all corners: the medals and the athletes covered almost of the nation, both geographically and demographically. The 'unity in diversity' line has rarely hit harder.\n\nThere were maiden golds in equestrian sports, where riders spend crores of rupees and all their life in training and bonding with their horses, and stunning golds in sports like steeplechase, whose greatest Indian exponent once served in Siachen. There was 62-year-old Raju Tolani winning bridge silver and 15-year-old Anahat Singh winning a couple of bronzes in squash. The ages of the bronze winning women's speed skating team read: 29, 17, 15, 15. There was 18-year-old Esha Singh winning 4 shooting medals on debut, there was 37-year-old Saurav Ghosal winning his eighth and ninth squash medal in his fifth Asiad.\n\nThere were dominant, lead-from-the-front wins in compound archery (where India won all five of the five golds on offer) and shooting (Sift Kaur Samra, annihilating the world record en-route 50m 3P gold) . There were incredibly gutsy come-from-behind wins like HS Prannoy in his badminton quarter and the Indian men's squash team in the final (against Pakistan, that too). Indian cricket debuted at the Games and did what Indian cricket is always expected to. There was Neeraj Chopra doing what Neeraj Chopra does, but with a surprise push. There were minor miracles like Sutirtha and Ayhika Mukherjee pulling off one of the great wins in Indian sporting history.\n\nThis is so good to see \u2764\ufe0f (via revolve_around_sun/IG) pic.twitter.com/8CSxPT4xFY - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 7, 2023\n\nTake all this into consideration, and India's medal haul is a great win, the stories of the past fortnight the reason we all - fans and journalists alike - invest so much of our life in sport.\n\nHowever, it's also necessary to take a step back and see things from a slightly broader perspective.\n\nChina have won 194 GOLDS - that's just counting their gold medals - this Asiad, and they have more on the way over the next day and a half. They hit the 100-medal mark in the early morning hours of day three (India did so on Day 13).\n\nThe behemoth that is the Chinese sports system is what you get with focused, long-term, goal-oriented planning. There may be faults with it, but if your target is that medal tally, then they have set out the blueprint on how a large country of unimaginable numbers and with a varied demographic can do it.\n\nMANAN VATSYAYANA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nScale apart, there is another difference between India's success and China's. For Indian athletes, it's their win defeating systems, and of systems defeating circumstances.\n\nThe protagonists of the win deserve our plaudits; everything that makes it so difficult for them needs closer examination. You could construe it as finding negatives instead of celebrating the achievements, but it actually makes the 105 number look even more remarkable.\n\nTake the compound archers. What Jyothi Vennam and Ojas Deotale and the rest have achieved is magnificent, unprecedented, but they shouldn't be allowed to fade away simply because their sport has no representation in Paris. This clean sweep didn't happen by accident. India has been slowly and steadily climbing their way to the top, one world championship at a time. Five of the six archers are in the world top 10, the one outside it is #19. These aren't Asia-level champs, but global, and yet they struggle for recognition and support. So what if it's not an Olympic sport? If the dream is to see India's flag fly high, few lift it taller than these unassuming super athletes.\n\nRowing returned from Hangzhou with 5 medals. Almost all the rowers learnt the sport only after joining the Indian armed forces. They're winning medals after learning as adults - imagine if they get access to the kind of focused training successful rowing nations afford to their athletes at a much younger age.\n\nThat wrestling returns with any medals at all (six, for the record) seems a miracle given the chaos and drama surrounding the federation, the selection trials and most importantly the moving-so-slow-it-may-just-be-dead court case against the man who held Indian wrestling in his fist for the past decade.\n\nBajrang Punia: beaten but unbowed, a winner on a bigger stage. Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe 3x3 Basketball players wowed crowds and won hearts (if not medals) but they will come back to news that their federation will not allow India players to play in the only (newly set-up) national league around. There are athletes, like the men's 5x5 basketball team, who didn't even travel to Hangzhou because the sports ministry decided to not let them.\n\nWhere the kabaddi men were expected to win gold, the superstars India sees evening-after-evening in the Pro Kabaddi League, no one even knew who the women's kabaddi team were. They won a stunning gold, and now we'll see them next in Nagoya 2026.\n\nIndia got medals from sports that most people don't even realise exist (either in life or in the Asiad specifically): Sepaktakraw and wushu sound like fantasy games and yet an ecosystem exists in the shadows, its numbers small, like family, its medallists winners against all odds.\n\nAnd speaking the wushu family, spare a thought for three members of the squad who didn't even make it to China. Nyeman Wangsu, Onilu Tega and Mepung Lamgu remained in India despite being cleared to play by everyone who was supposed to let them. The reason: They are from Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nINDIA HAVE DONE IT! pic.twitter.com/f2SfZTG1xG - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 6, 2023\n\nWhat could have been a major diplomatic incident (China not issuing regular visas to Indian citizens from Arunachal Pradesh) was responded to by vociferous protests for a day, and the union sports minister boycotting the Games opening ceremony and... that's it. As the Games wore on and the medals flowed in, they were forgotten. In a nation of nearly a billion and half, attention spans are not built to last that long.\n\nSo, as we celebrate the six hundred and fifty-two athletes who went, as we bask in the reflected glory of the one hundred and seven medals these athletes combined to win... let us also shine a spotlight on everything that remains hidden in the shadows. On the forgotten three; on the systems that don't work, and the circumstances that don't allow the systems-that-do to function at capacity; on the superstars who go through the grind day-in and day-out dreaming of wearing India on their chest and a medal on their necks.\n\n107. Brilliant. But this must only be the start.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIndia had a terrific 2022 Asian Games at Hangzhou, China and the number of medals are backed up by sporting achievements both good and great.\n\nFrom the broader figures to the small, offbeat ones that may have skipped our attention, ESPN India picks out the numbers that defined India's incredible campaign:\n\n107\n\nThe number of medals India won at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Unprecedented. Record-shattering, history making. India are now only the fourth nation to cross the 100-medal mark at an Asiad. This is a 52% increase from India's previous best haul (70, set last time at Jakarta 2018).\n\nAlso, as impressive as that number is, it tells you only half the story.\n\n4\n\nIndia's 4th place finish is the best the country has been placed since a third-place finish in Jakarta 1962 and a second-place one in New Delhi 1951.\n\n22\n\nIndia won medals in 22 disciplines - that's the most disciplines India have medalled in at a single Asiad ever. The best before that was 18... in 2018.\n\n100%\n\n5 Compound archery finals, five gold medals: what the Indian archers did at Hangzhou was simply astounding. Just to show you how dominant they were, Ojas Deotale hit 44 10s out of a possible 45 in the quarters, semis and final of the men's individual event. Ridiculous.\n\nOjas and Jyothi Surekha Vennam were also India's most successful athletes with three golds each.\n\n65\n\nMinutes that the kabaddi men's final was 'suspended' for as India's players protested a referee's interpretation of a rule and then the Iranian players did likewise. A reminder: a kabaddi match is actually just 40 minutes long.\n\n1\n\nSatwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty won India's first ever badminton gold at the Asian Games. In the process, they also became the first Indian men's pair to be ranked world no.1.\n\nSatwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. JUST. TOO. GOOD. pic.twitter.com/2uZcdjj8XW - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 7, 2023\n\n7.6\n\nThere has rarely ever been a series of five shots like this: 10.2, 10.3, 7.6, 10.5, 10.1.\n\nAt the time of the first two shots, Swapnil Suresh Kusale was leading the men's 50m rifle 3 positions final, and by a margin. Then came the 7.6. That dropped him to fifth, and even though the 10.5 helped to gain one place, the 10.1 was good enough only to seal fourth.\n\nFrom gold to no medal, and it all came from a wild outlier of a shot.\n\n- 115 and 2\n\nIndia's rugby women's team were put in a tough, tough group and it showed. Throughout four matches today and yesterday, they conceded 122, but they did score a try (and make a conversion). The real number that defined their tournament was two. Hupi Majhi whizzed past the Japanese defence and it looked almost certain she'd score. Almost. Two yards from the try line she was tackled, brought down, and a turnover was forced almost immediately. Just 2 yards.\n\n3 for 6 in 4\n\nIn cricket, how do you defend a total of 116 in 20 overs? It probably helps if your medium pacer comes and removes the opposition's entire top order for the cost of a boundary and a half.\n\nThat's exactly what Titas Ranadeep Sadhu did as she cleaned up Sri Lanka with figures of 3/6 in four overs as India's women's team beat Sri Lanka to win Asian Games gold on debut.\n\n4: 15-15, 16-16, 17-17, 18-18\n\nIn the 10m mixed team shooting bronze medal match, India's Ramita Jindal and Divyansh Panwar took a massive 8-0 lead before South Korea's Eunseo Lee and Hajun Park clutch-shot their way back to 9-9. But the drama was just starting. India went 13-9 up, then 15-11 before Lee and Park upped their game once again to make it 15-15.\n\nThen it became a straight shootout, whoever won the next set would take bronze: and that brought with it an extraordinary series of shots where both teams hit the exact same scores: 21.0 to make it 16-16, 21.0 again to make it 17-17 and 20.9 to make it 18-18! Four series, four tied scores...incredible!\n\nIn the end, Lee and Park would clinch it 20-18 with a score of 21.5 vs 21.2.\n\nAge no barrier: Bharati Dey, 77, leads the Indian women's bridge team at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Getty Images\n\n77\n\nAn Indian athlete at the Asian Games who pre-dates independent India. Whoddathunk? Bharati Dey, 77, was born in March 1946 and led India's women's bridge team at Hangzhou. What's even funkier? Her youngest teammate, Vidhya Patel, is 22. From the British Empire to the new millennium, this team has seen it all.\n\n469.6\n\nIndia's first individual gold of the Hangzhou Games was won in some style; Sift Kaur Samra obliterating the world record (by 2.6 points) en route to winning by a margin of 7.6 (in a sport where the highest points possible per shot is 10.9). MBBS' loss is world shooting's gain.\n\n8.9\n\nIn the penultimate round of shooting in the final of the 50m 3 Positions rifle, Ashi Chouksey needed just a 9.4 to enter the final round and make it a remarkable 1-2 to India. Coming off a series of 10.5 and 10.2, silver was in the bag... till she shot an 8.9. That was that, and silver changed in an instant to bronze.\n\nOh, what could have been.\n\n10 and 10\n\nImagine needing perfection, twice -- at the very last chance -- to win gold. Imagine nailing perfection. Men's pistol last two shots: After Arjun Singh Cheema had shot a 9 with his final shot, India needed to make no mistakes to beat China to gold, and that's what Sarabjot Singh and Shiva Narwal did, hitting a 10 each on their last shot. That took India's total to 533, just 1 point ahead of China's total.\n\n-48.24\n\nOne of those sobering numbers that show you how far India are from the best in certain events. India smashed their national record in the finals of the 4x200m women's freestyle relay by swimming it in 8:37.58 but what really put this in context was how far away they were from eventual gold medalists, China... who finished 48.24 seconds ahead of them.\n\nThis is so good to see \u2764\ufe0f (via revolve_around_sun/IG) pic.twitter.com/8CSxPT4xFY - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) October 7, 2023\n\n(177 + 112) - (2+4) = 283\n\nAyhika Mukherjee is world no. 177, Sutirtha 112. Chen Meng is world no.2, Wang Yidi world no. 4. But the Indians played 'bindaas' and pulled off a win that still has the potential to send the TT world into a spin. They ended with a bronze, but Mukherjee magic will live on in Indian sporting fable.\n\n425\n\nAvinash Sable ran, everyone else chased. In what was one of the most dominant displays on an Asiad track by an Indian, Sable completely dominated the men's 3000m steeplechase final to win by 4.25 seconds. And he did that while jogging and celebrating much before the finish line. Incredible.\n\n0, 0... 2\n\nIn his men's individual recurve archery QF, Dhiraj Bommadevara had a nightmarish outing. In a sport where archers are disappointed to not score 9 or 10 on the target, Dhiraj managed to miss the entirety of the target completely - TWICE. Two zeros. He would make up for it with some clutch shooting in the men's team event, where India won a maiden silver.\n\n1 and 0.59\n\nParul Chaudhary became the first-ever female athlete at the Asian Games to medal in the women's 3000m steeplechase (silver) and 5000m race (gold). She's also the first Indian women to win a 5000m gold.\n\nYet, these feats were 0.59 seconds away from not happening - Parul producing a late kick on the inside to sneak past leader Ririka Hironaka of Japan in the last 30 metres. Ririka's stunned face, perfectly captured by the photographers at the Asian Games is perhaps the best descriptor of how thrilling the end to that race was.\n\n68\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team scored 68 goals in total during their gold-winning campaign at the Hangzhou Asian Games. They had scored 80 goals in 2018, but finished with the bronze. Perhaps Craig Fulton has a point with his 'defend to attack' philosophy.",
