                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nLocal residents confronted and drove off neo-Nazi demonstrators waving large swastika-emblazoned flags along a highway overpass on Friday between Lincoln Heights and Evendale, Ohio, home to a historically Black community that has endured a long history of racism.\n\nWhite nationalist groups in Ohio have recently grown increasingly brazen in expressing hateful rhetoric and racist ideologies. Last November, Hate Club, a newly formed White supremacist organization, paraded through a Columbus neighborhood, waving swastika flags and shouting racist slurs.\n\nAbout a dozen neo-Nazis, wearing all black clothing and red face masks the marchers in Columbus also wore, were seen on traffic cameras waving the swastika flags. They had also pinned red swastika banners on the fence of the overpass and a sign reading \u201cAmerica for the White Man,\u201d according to photos shared with CNN.\n\nSwastikas are a notorious symbol of hate, antisemitism and White supremacy tracing to the murderous legacy of Germany\u2019s Nazi Party and the Holocaust.\n\nIn footage documented by CNN affiliate WLWT, people can be seen walking up to the demonstrators as police officers stood in between them. Moments within confronting them, the neo-Nazis quickly backed up, jumped into a U-Haul box truck and left the scene.\n\nLaw enforcement officials at the scene can also be seen ushering the demonstrators into the U-Haul truck and waving at them to go.\n\nDemonstrators wearing all black and carrying large swastika-emblazoned Nazi flags stand along a highway overpass in Evendale, Ohio, on Friday. Ohio Department of Transportation\n\nPolice became aware of \u201cunannounced protest activity\u201d around 2 p.m. on Friday on Vision Way overlooking Interstate 75, the Evendale Police Department said in a news release. Evendale is about 12 miles north of downtown Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cThe protest, while very offensive, was not unlawful,\u201d police said. \u201cThe protest was short lived in duration. The protestors left the area on their own. No further action was taken by the Evendale Police Department.\u201d\n\nEvents organized or attended by White supremacists in the United States hit a new high in 2023, the Anti-Defamation League reported. Public gatherings of White nationalists or people with Nazi flags have unfolded in recent years in Nashville, New Hampshire, Boston, Virginia, Michigan and Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cWe are underestimating the dangers of the police not even attempting to identify them. Who are they trying to protect? Because it isn\u2019t us,\u201d local resident Kachara Talbert, who confronted the protesters, told CNN. \u201cIt could be another Hitler behind those masks. It could be a school shooter behind those masks.\u201d\n\nThe Vision Way overpass connects Evendale to the village of Lincoln Heights, the first all-Black, self-governing city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, according to the Cincinnati Preservation Association.\n\nEvendale is also just two miles away from Reading, which used to be one of thousands of White-only communities throughout the US known as \u201csundown towns,\u201d where local laws prohibited Black people and other people of color to be out after sunset to intimidate them from living in the area.\n\n\u201cThe sign they posted said \u2018America for the White Man\u2019 and it makes me ask, what makes this group, that literally originated in another country, think they are more entitled to America than me and my folks?\u201d Talbert said. \u201cThis country was made of Black blood, sweat and tears, so why do these colonizers feel so comfortable?\u201d\n\nThe Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to the scene and helped de-escalate the situation \u201cand make sure that no one was hurt,\u201d Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLincoln Heights residents are understandably upset,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe continue to work with the community, and emphasize that there is no place for hate in Hamilton County.\u201d\n\nCincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval also released a statement on X condemning the incident and said it was \u201cshocking and disgusting to see swastikas displayed in Evendale today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not what we stand for, and it will never be what we stand for,\u201d the mayor added. \u201cMessages of hate like this have no place in our region.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to the mayor, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, the Evendale Police Department and the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office for additional comment but did not receive a reply.\n\nThe statements from officials and law enforcement upset local residents who said the lack of effort to hold the racist demonstrators accountable will enable them to return and sends a message to Americans that what they are doing is acceptable.\n\n\u201cTheir statements talk about how hate has no place here, but no justice was served. These are terrorists we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Talbert said. \u201cSeeing the flag being represented here and seeing the police stand there in what looked like unity, not disgust, made us feel like they\u2019re saying what the Nazis stand for is OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to protect our community\u201d\n\nNews of the demonstrators\u2019 display spread quickly throughout the city as photos and videos were shared all over Facebook. One by one, dozens of residents, including Talbert, showed up to form a crowd that did not hesitate to approach the neo-Nazis and pull one of their flags, which they later set on fire.\n\n\u201cAnger and rage just came over me. I literally got there in about 15 minutes,\u201d Talbert told CNN. \u201cThe Nazis were disrespecting my family, my lineage, my heritage. I took it very much personally. I needed to be there to take that flag down, and I needed to push those people out of our community.\u201d\n\nAs they approached the neo-Nazis, the demonstrators, which Talbert said were carrying guns, called them the N-word.\n\nA prayer circle forms after a group displaying swastika flags was seen demonstrating on an Interstate 75 overpass in Evendale on February 7, 2025. Liz Dufour/The Cincinnati Enquirer/USA Today Network/Imagn Images\n\nVideo posted by an unknown account on Facebook obtained by local community members showed what appeared to be the demonstrators from Friday using the N-word and other derogatory language to refer to approaching residents who were coming to confront them.\n\n\u201cLook at the n***ers coming,\u201d one masked demonstrator says, as multiple others echo the racist slur. Another says, \u201cthe cops are going to give us an escort to Freddy\u2019s car,\u201d and another replies \u201cf**k yeah.\u201d\n\nTalbert said the chaotic confrontation lasted just minutes before the demonstrators hurriedly ran off in the U-Haul.\n\n\u201cMembers of my community ripped the flag out of their hand and burned it up, we spit on it, and if needed, it really could have gotten ugly,\u201d Talbert said. \u201cWe will not hesitate to protect our community. And after the show they put on, every Black community that you can think of is going to show up for us 100%.\u201d\n\nThe lack of action from law enforcement to question and obtain the identities of the demonstrators was an \u201cinsult\u201d to the community, Talbert said, which she says has seen the same police department interrogate locals and minors for simple, non-dangerous offenses like congregating on sidewalks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched Black men all my life in this community being frisked and detained without probable cause,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see any rubber bullets that day. I didn\u2019t see anybody getting shot, like during Black Lives Matter protests. I didn\u2019t see gas. The calmness of the police overall, the way they were standing in front of them, it made us very upset.\u201d\n\nTeressa Brooks, who is also from Lincoln Heights, said the demonstrators called her an \u201cN-word b*tch.\u201d During the confrontation between the neo-Nazis and local residents, Brooks said police told them they were exercising their freedom of speech.\n\nShya Smith, another Lincoln Heights resident who stood up to the demonstrators, told CNN her community believes President Donald Trump and his administration have given the White nationalists the confidence to show up without fear of being punished.\n\n\u201cIt is so upsetting to see how a group of extremist people who promote hate can \u2018peacefully\u2019 protest while openly carrying rifles just 700 yards away from an elementary school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a slap in the face to watch the police protect them while a predominantly African American neighborhood fears for their safety and well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to fight back\u201d\n\nDespite the fear, anger and pain that has reverberated through the community in the wake of this reprehensible incident, it is unwavering love and unyielding unity that has emerged in response, sending a clear message to the hate-filled demonstrators: their behavior is not welcome here.\n\nThroughout the following morning and afternoon, local residents and neighbors from nearby towns gathered at the same overpass, this time holding signs and posters of solidarity, including one that read, \u201cMy father fought Nazis, and so will I.\u201d\n\nAs they were doing so, three cars belonging to the peaceful demonstrators had their rear windshields shattered by unknown perpetrators, according to Kim Lachance, whose car was broken into.\n\nKim Lachance and other demonstrators hold positive signs on the same overpass Saturday. Courtesy Tia Londyn\n\n\u201cI came here because I couldn\u2019t just sit by and not do anything for any longer,\u201d Lachance, who grew up in Lincoln Heights during desegregation, told CNN from the parking lot where her car had been vandalized. \u201cWe have to fight back.\u201d\n\nLachance was holding a sign that said \u201clove\u201d when two women drove by and stopped their cars to come out to give her a hug.\n\n\u201cThey were crying because they said yesterday they were so heartbroken,\u201d Lachance said. \u201cWe have to take care of our communities, especially ones that have gone through things like this and continue to go through things like this.\u201d\n\nThe presence of White supremacist groups in Ohio is not new. In the early 20th century, the Ku Klux Klan bombed the University of Dayton, held rallies in the state and assembled in towns such as Westerville, where the group established a stronghold.\n\n\u201cWhen you have years and years of oppression and you have Nazi supporters in office, as police officers, judges, that is what\u2019s making these people feel confident to do something like that,\u201d Talbert said.\n\n\u201cAmerica needs to stand up and stop this madness, because it\u2019s only going to get worse and it\u2019s going to get dangerous.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAll 10 people killed when a regional airline flight crashed off the coast of western Alaska have been recovered and identified, authorities said Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll ten individuals aboard the Bering Air plane have been officially brought home,\u201d the Nome Volunteer Fire Department said in a Facebook post Saturday night. \u201cNome SAR efforts stand by for our Bering Air crew to complete their aircraft recovery operations.\u201d\n\nThe small commuter aircraft carrying nine passengers and one pilot took off from Unalakleet on Thursday afternoon before disappearing. The plane was later found on Friday about 34 miles southeast of Nome, the flight\u2019s intended destination, according to the US Coast Guard. All 10 on board were declared dead.\n\nThe pilot of the plane was 34-year-old Chad Antill of Nome, while the passengers were identified by Alaska State Troopers as Liane Ryan, 52; Donnell Erickson, 58; Andrew Gonzalez, 30; Kameron Hartvigson, 41; Rhone Baumgartner, 46; Jadee Moncur, 52; Ian Hofmann, 45; Talaluk Katchatag, 34; and Carol Mooers, 48.\n\nThe wreckage is currently resting on sea ice that officials described as young and unstable, and heavy snow and winds in the area are expected this weekend. The bodies were the first be recovered, then the plane will be taken for further analysis, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to take. It could go hours; it could go potentially days. Coming up to tomorrow we have 18 hours of potential recovery time,\u201d Jim West, chief of the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, said at a news conference Friday night, citing the ever-changing conditions of the crash\u2019s site and incoming weather.\n\nA winter weather advisory is now in effect until 9 p.m. Sunday, with blowing snow, rain and mixed precipitation to be expected in Nome and other parts of western Alaska, the National Weather Service announced.\n\nSome areas may see up to five inches of snow, with ice accumulations of around a tenth of an inch, the NWS said. Wind gusts as high as 45 mph will also be recorded.\n\n\u201cThe conditions out there are dynamic, so we\u2019ve got to do it safely and the fastest we can,\u201d he added.\n\nLearning how the accident unfolded\n\nInvestigators are working to determine the cause of the crash \u2013\u2013 and how the aircraft suddenly dropped in elevation and speed. Analyzing air traffic control data will be key to the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s probe, officials said.\n\nThe NTSB has nine people working on the ground along with a dozen specialists supporting them back in Washington, DC, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a Saturday news conference.\n\n\u201cPlease understand there\u2019s some difficult conditions, because this is on an ice floe, which is moving about five miles a day,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Cessna aircraft, operated by Bering Air, was about 12 miles offshore when its position was lost, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nThe aircraft \u201cexperienced some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed\u201d around 3:18 p.m. Thursday, Coast Guard Lt. Commander Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said.\n\nThe search for the aircraft had been complicated by multiple factors, including inclement weather as well as the missing plane had not communicated its position through an emergency transmitter, officials said.\n\nVisibility was better for searchers Friday morning: The sky was clear at Nome Airport around 10 a.m., with temperatures of around 5 degrees. The National Guard and Coast Guard added helicopter search teams to the effort Friday morning, while another Coast Guard C-130 landed in Nome to assist with the search, the fire department said.\n\nThe Bering Air building in Nome, Alaska. Carol Seppilu\n\nA small community accustomed to flying mourns\n\nAt a vigil hosted by the city of Nome on Friday, Amanda Snyder, pastor at Our Savior\u2019s Lutheran Church, urged those in attendance to lean on each other for support.\n\n\u201cPlease do not isolate yourself in your grief. In the coming days, in the weeks, as we begin to hear of which families are impacted, our hearts are going to break over and over, and it\u2019s okay to mourn and grief, but please do not isolate,\u201d Snyder said.\n\n\u201cWords can\u2019t express the loss we\u2019re all feeling, we\u2019re all connected in so many ways,\u201d said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who joined the vigil via video conference. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to accept the reality of our loss.\u201d\n\nIt is not unusual for Alaskans to travel between places by small plane due to the vast landscape and lack of transportation infrastructure available.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just heartbreaking. Because every single person in this room has been on one of those planes,\u201d Snyder told The Nome Nugget, the city\u2019s local paper. \u201cIt hits home.\u201d\n\nRhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson were two employees from Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium who traveled to Unalakleet \u201cto service a heat recovery system that is critical to the community\u2019s water plant,\u201d the nonprofit said Friday night.\n\n\u201cRhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson were passionate about the work they did, cared deeply for the communities they served, and made a lasting impact on rural communities across our state,\u201d Natasha Singh, ANTHC interim president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey were the best at what they did and had just flown into Unalakleet to help address heating and mechanical issues in the depths of winter. They gave the ultimate sacrifice for the people we serve in the work we do.\u201d\n\nHomendy said she understands how tragic the crash is to the area.\n\n\u201cThe NTSB knows that villages like Nome and Alaska aviation are tight-knit communities, so this tragedy affects so many,\u201d she said Saturday. \u201cPlease know that we\u2019ll work diligently to determine how this happened, with the ultimate goal of improving safety here in Alaska and across the United States.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Sarah Dewberry, Emma Tucker, Rebekah Riess, Chimaine Pouteau and Jeremy Harlan contributed to this report.",

Suffolk County District Attorney's Office\n\nThe case received renewed attention in 2023 when retired Suffolk County police detective Pasquale Albergo sought to get the case reexamined with modern forensic technology, Tierney said.\n\n\u201cDetective Albergo, amongst many, never stopped thinking about this heinous murder even after his retirement, and he continued to think about ways in which we could potentially come to a positive result,\u201d Tierney said.\n\nDuring the initial investigation, detectives documented the scene and preserved fingerprint and blood evidence throughout the home. However, forensic techniques at the time were not advanced enough to identify a killer, and the case went cold.\n\nDetectives had a blurry photograph of a latent print found on a window blind where the killer had entered Schubert\u2019s home and, with more advanced technology, were able to run it through a database to find a match, according to the district attorney.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, with modern high-definition photography, they were able to take a picture of that picture, which turned out to be the defendant Ayala\u2019s left thumbprint,\u201d Tierney said.\n\nHis prints were also found to be \u201can identical match\u201d to another print on a door near the broken window, Tierney said.\n\nAyala was 29 years old when the killing happened and lived less than 200 yards from Schubert.\n\nThe homes of Edna Schubert and Raul Ayala. The home circled in red was Schubert\u2019s, and in yellow was Ayala\u2019s.

                "text": "Altadena, California CNN \u2014\n\nYvette Anderson and her family have stayed in four hotels and an AirBnb in the month since their Altadena home was ravaged by the Eaton Fire \u2013 and with a knock on their door Tuesday afternoon, a hotel employee informed them they would once again have to pack up their few remaining belongings and find another place to stay.\n\nThe hotel, where they had been using a Federal Emergency Management Agency voucher to pay for their room, was entirely booked the next day, the employee told them. Though the hotel said the Andersons were told in advance their reservation would end Tuesday, no one in the family remembers that conversation.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s entirely possible that their minds were elsewhere.\n\nThe fires that ignited in Los Angeles County in early January scorched nearly 40,000 acres, left at least 29 people dead and damaged or destroyed approximately 18,000 homes, schools and businesses. Thousands of displaced residents have returned to their incinerated neighborhoods to find a moonscape of devastation: smoky carcasses of cars, ash-laden lands and the once-gorgeous homes of the upper, middle and working classes indiscriminately transformed into rubble \u2013 much of it likely laced with heavy metals, asbestos and other untold toxins.\n\nNow, displaced residents find themselves at a crossroads. Will they shoulder months and years of painstaking rebuilding or cut their losses and leave their beloved communities behind?\n\nMany in Altadena, including the Andersons, are determined to rebuild. But the arduous process, which can often feel like a full-time job, has begun to consume their lives and take a hefty mental toll.\n\n\u201cThey are starting to call us \u2018zombies\u2019 because we look drained (and) out of it,\u201d said Heidi Luest, an artist who heard the morbid nickname being tossed around at a hair salon and grocery store in Altadena.\n\nThe task of rebuilding is monumental, involving constant communication with insurance companies, government employees, architects and builders. Before any work can be done, residents must first clear the wreckage \u2013 either through hiring a private contractor or by registering for removal through federal assistance. On top of it all, most families must transition to rental homes amid skyrocketing prices and surging demand \u2013 even while paying the mortgage on a home that no longer exists.\n\nStreet after street of Altadena's neighborhoods were ravaged by the January fires. CNN\n\nAnderson is concerned her community will fall victim to price gouging amid the incredible demand as thousands of residents simultaneously try to rebuild. California\u2019s Attorney General has already warned more than 200 hotels and landlords against price gouging rent and his office has also told homeowners to be wary of illegal, unlicensed contractors.\n\n\u201cThe price of everything is going to go up. It\u2019s going to be their market. This is going to be the time that the contractors and the manufacturers can make money,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nRight now, Anderson\u2019s insurance will cover about two years of rent as they wait for their home to be built. But she worries that construction could take longer, possibly putting her in a financial bind if she has to pay both her $1,500 mortgage and a $3,500 rent.\n\n\u201cI want to know: Is FEMA going to still be with us four or five years from now to assist us if I need to come back to them?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe whole process is starting to wear away at the Andersons, especially Yvette\u2019s 80-year-old mother, Katherine, who suffers from Stage 4 kidney failure. Moving at least once a week has caused \u201cwear and tear\u201d on her aging mother, she said.\n\n\u201cShe might seem strong, but I looked at her the other day, sitting in the room, her legs are swelling up and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is taking a toll on her,\u2019\u201d Anderson said.\n\nAnderson tries to hold it together in front of her family, but sometimes when she is all alone in her car, she bursts into tears. The mother and Veterans Affairs nurse knows she should get counseling but she wants to wait until her family is in a more stable place. If she sits in the pain long enough, she says, she might break down completely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to stay strong because I have my mom and everybody. If I break, they\u2019re gonna break, and then it\u2019s gonna be a domino effect. So I can\u2019t break.\u201d\n\n\u2018They\u2019re starting to call us zombies\u2019\n\nSome fire victims, like visual artist Luest, feel debilitated by the compounding trauma of losing one\u2019s home and the gargantuan pile of administrative tasks that comes along with it.\n\nLuest, who designs stage props for performers like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, worked out of her home and is also struggling to keep up with her livelihood after all of her tools and supplies were burned. She has tried to take on jobs from her rental home but often has to drop everything to take calls from insurance agents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got this giant wall of things you have to go through. What do you stab at first?\u201d\n\nHeidi Luest stands in the ruins of her home four days after it was destroyed in the Eaton Fire. David Butow/Redux for CNN\n\nAs Luest was out running errands on Tuesday, she heard several people in the hair salon and grocery store refer to wildfire victims as \u201czombies,\u201d apparently referring to how drained and exhausted they appear.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m trying to move through a swamp and my head is not clear,\u201d Luest said. In recent days, that feeling has worsened. \u201cI can\u2019t think straight. I feel slow and sluggish.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what is the biggest roadblock she is facing, she says, \u201cmyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to sit in bed. \u2026 If you stop and take two days off to grieve a little bit you\u2019re already so far behind,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018How do I quantify 25 years of our life?\u2019\n\nAltadena residents are facing vastly different options for recovery based on the strength of their insurance coverage and their personal finances. Many Californians have recently struggled to afford private insurance as climate change has increased the frequency and severity of natural disasters in the state.\n\nIn the months leading up to the fires, several homeowners in Altadena reported that their insurance providers declined to renew their policies, forcing many people onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 a bare-bones state insurance plan for those who need coverage as a condition of their mortgage, according to the AP.\n\nEven those who are lucky enough to still have private coverage, like Gilien Silsby, are concerned their policies won\u2019t cover the full extent of their losses.\n\nSilsby lost both her own home and her parents\u2019 home, where she grew up and was married to her husband, Jim. Though she is grateful to have fairly robust insurance coverage, she worries she won\u2019t be able to recoup the value of everything inside her house. Insurance companies often ask for a detailed account of lost belongings, but Silsby and her husband had not prepared an inventory of their home, as people in fire-prone areas are recommended to do. They never imagined a fire would reach their home about 2 miles west of Eaton Canyon.\n\n\u201cOur lives are consumed with calls to our insurance adjuster, trying to replace things,\u201d Silsby said. \u201cHow do I quantify 25 years of our life?\u201d\n\nResidents leave a note among the rubble of their home in Altadena. CNN\n\nSilsby and her husband have met with an architect, but she believes their insurance policy will not cover the full cost of building a home comparable to the one that burned down. In the 25 years since they bought the home, they had nearly paid off their mortgage and the property\u2019s value had nearly quadrupled.\n\n\u201cWe feel like in the long term it\u2019s going to be a big, huge financial burden. And most of my friends are feeling that way too,\u201d Silsby said.\n\nSilsby\u2019s mom and stepdad, ages 86 and 90, are also determined to rebuild their home, meaning their daughter is shouldering twice the amount of work. Her aging parents are not able to navigate complicated paperwork or online portals, leaving Silsby to do it for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really, really hard. I think I definitely have post-traumatic stress. I am seeing a counselor every week who\u2019s really helping me. There are a lot of people that have surprised me in different ways, either really stepping up and helping us or being a support. And then there\u2019s a lot of people who have really disappointed me, who I thought would be there and aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSlowly, her family is trying to replace the little belongings that made them feel like themselves. She and her husband literally jumped for joy when they found on eBay a casserole dish that they had bought in Ireland after getting married.\n\nEven so, nothing can replicate the comfort of being home.\n\n\u201cEvery day I cry because I just miss my home. I just want to go home.\u201d\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know that I would receive this type of love\u2019\n\nDespite all of the pain and exhaustion, compassion has come from unexpected places. In addition to the flood of aid from state and federal agencies and nonprofits, Anderson and others say they have been touched by small acts of kindness.\n\nAnderson\u2019s coworkers at the Veterans Affairs medical center in west Los Angeles have been a steady pillar of support. After the fire, many of them brought her new uniforms to replace the ones she had lost. One coworker makes her lunch every day and refuses to accept repayment.\n\nAnderson family members in a photo taken in front of their now-ruined home. From left to right: Katherine Anderson, Paulette Allen, Exette Akhund, Yvette Anderson. Courtesy Yvette Anderson\n\n\u201cThey really have showed up and showed out for me. Some days I go to work and when I see them, I just say, \u2018Give me a hug,\u2019 and I cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I would receive this type of love from work.\u201d\n\nAs the family struggled to find a reliable place to live, Anderson\u2019s mother worried that they might end up in a shelter. But Anderson knew that would never happen. She has patients that would never allow her to become homeless. One of her patients has offered the family space in their seven-bedroom home if they ever find themselves in a tough spot. Another patient she treated two years ago called her out of the blue one day and asked if she needed anything.\n\n\u201cBy me taking care of people, people are looking out, taking care of me,\u201d Anderson said.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAll major pieces of the American Airlines plane and Black Hawk helicopter that collided last week in Washington, DC, have been recovered, the National Transportation Safety Board announced Saturday.\n\nThe wreckage from the two aircraft, which crashed January 29 over the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, has been taken to a secure airport facility for further examination, according to the NTSB.\n\n\u201cInvestigators will be looking for witness marks on the aircraft that could provide clues to the angle of collision,\u201d the agency said in a news release Saturday evening.\n\nInvestigators were searching for wreckage from last week\u2019s deadly midair collision and conducted an overnight scan of the Potomac River where the aircraft fell using advanced imaging technology to map the riverbed and locate debris.\n\nThe scan was performed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. on Saturday by using an aircraft to deploy green laser pulses to map the riverbed and locate debris from the collision. The technology, called TopoBathy lidar, is designed to produce detailed underwater imagery and guide recovery teams.\n\nThe survey \u201cidentified multiple underwater targets that could be additional aircraft debris,\u201d the NTSB said in the release Saturday. \u201cDivers investigated those targets today and will continue that work this week.\u201d\n\nThe scan was initially scheduled to take place overnight on Friday but was delayed until Saturday, weather permitting, the NTSB said. Information from Saturday\u2019s scan will be part of the NTSB\u2019s ongoing investigation, the agency told CNN.\n\nThe collision on January 29 killed 67 people near Reagan National Airport.\n\nThe NTSB, along with the Naval Sea Systems Command Supervisor of Salvage and Diving, lifted much of the Black Hawk and other large portions of wreckage from the river Thursday.\n\nInvestigators have begun examining the material and flight data from both aircraft to reconstruct the events leading to the crash.\n\nLawmakers briefed on investigation\n\nLawmakers were briefed Thursday by investigators examining the collision, but no significant new findings were disclosed, they said.\n\nAfter the briefing, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said investigators were still determining whether the Black Hawk\u2019s ADS-B system \u2014 an advanced surveillance technology that provides real-time tracking data \u2014 was installed and operational at the time of the crash.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are avionics on that helicopter that we need to evaluate in order to determine what they did have and what was on at the time. More to come,\u201d Homendy told reporters.\n\nThe ADS-B system transmits critical information, including an aircraft\u2019s location, altitude, positioning and speed to other aircraft and air traffic controllers. Whether this system had a role in last week\u2019s collision has become a focal point for lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThis was a training mission, so there was no compelling national security reason for ADS-B to be turned off,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, the chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which has oversight of commercial airspace.\n\nSen. Tammy Duckworth, a former Black Hawk pilot in the Army, noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not clear whether the technology was turned on, but the Army confirmed it was installed in the aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe Black Hawk, stationed at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, was conducting an annual proficiency training exercise in \u201cgovernment continuity\u201d at the time of the collision, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. He noted the pilots were highly experienced and wearing night vision goggles during the flight.\n\nFAA expands safety review amid broader concerns\n\nWhile recovery teams continue their search, the Federal Aviation Administration has reduced air traffic at the airport, partly because of the recovery efforts but also due to weather conditions, an FAA spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe airport\u2019s hourly arrival rate decreased from 28 to 26 flights, causing average delays to rise from 40 to 50 minutes, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\nSeveral senators, including Cruz, called for a review of airports nationwide that handle significant helicopter traffic in close proximity to commercial jets, something the FAA announced Thursday it will carry out.\n\nCNN\u2019s Emma Tucker, Andy Rose and Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe federal hiring freeze implemented by President Donald Trump has affected the hiring of a crucial group of federal workers: firefighters.\n\nThe freeze comes at a critical time, when fire departments across the country would typically onboard thousands of seasonal federal firefighters in preparation for wildfires in the spring and summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really bad, really quick,\u201d said Ben McLane, a federal hand crew captain and board member with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lack of personnel when fire season gets going,\u201d McLane told CNN on Friday. \u201cThe precedent that we\u2019ve seen over the last few decades at this point is making us pretty certain that it\u2019s going to be a big fire season again.\u201d\n\nThe federal hiring freeze, initiated through one of the executive orders the president signed on his first day in office, dictates that no new federal civilian positions can be created and no vacant positions can be filled.\n\nFederal firefighters are an essential part of the nation\u2019s firefighting capability. The Department of the Interior employed 5,780 federal wildland fire personnel in 2024, while the US Forest Service employed over 11,300.\n\nFederal firefighters \u201crespond to fires all over the nation and internationally,\u201d according to McLane. \u201cThe federal government is the only resource that does that as fluidly and nimbly.\u201d\n\nThe majority of firefighters employed by the federal government are seasonal, hired as either permanent or temporary employees, according to McLane. Each year, ahead of the summer fire season, these employees have to be rehired, he explained.\n\n\u201cAll of that is stopped right now,\u201d McLane said. And there\u2019s \u201cno wiggle room in the schedule\u201d for restarting the hiring process at a later date and ensuring crews are ready for the height of fire season.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the ability to snap our fingers and just bring these people back,\u201d he said.\n\nThe freeze means that fire trucks in Utah could be left with two people per truck instead of four or five \u2013 and some trucks won\u2019t be staffed at all, according to CNN affiliate KSL.\n\nThe Department of the Interior, which employs firefighters through the Bureau of Land Management, told CNN in a statement it was \u201cimplementing President Donald J. Trump\u2019s Executive Order across the federal civilian workforce.\u201d\n\nThe US Forest Service told CNN that \u201cwildland firefighting positions are considered public safety positions\u201d and the department has been \u201cactively working\u201d with the White House Office of Performance and Personnel Management.\n\nCal Fire, which described the Forest Service as \u201can important partner,\u201d told CNN it\u2019s \u201cunknown at this time how this freeze will impact the protection of federal lands in California.\u201d\n\nUnderstaffed and underpaid\n\nThe freeze also comes as fire departments across the country have already faced staff shortages. In Los Angeles, where devastating wildfires killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes in January, the fire department is less staffed than almost any other major city, with less than one firefighter for every 1,000 residents.\n\nAnd federal firefighters too have struggled to maintain staffing, largely because they are \u201cwoefully underpaid,\u201d according to Steve Gutierrez, who represents federal firefighters and other land management employees for the National Federation of Federal Employees. Federal firefighters can make just $15 an hour starting out, according to Gutierrez, who called attention to a bill currently in Congress that would raise firefighters\u2019 pay.\n\n\u201cNo one does this to become a millionaire,\u201d he told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThey save lives every single day by preventing communities from burning.\u201d\n\nThe freeze \u201cinstills no confidence\u201d in the federal government among federal firefighters, said Gutierrez, who worked as a wildland firefighter for 15 years.\n\n\u201cThe only people that have their back right now is their union,\u201d he said.\n\nThe longer the freeze goes on, the higher the chance that firefighters waiting to be rehired for the season will take jobs elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely we can lose all these skilled employees, that are skilled resources that the American taxpayers paid for, to other entities, and never recuperate on that,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never see our return on investment.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order specifies that it does not prohibit hirings to \u201cmaintain essential services, and protect national security, homeland security, and public safety.\u201d\n\nThe effect on firefighters comes because the White House has not said that firefighters fall under those \u201cessential services\u201d and thus warrant an exemption from the freeze, according to McLane.\n\n\u201cWe need to find out soon if there is intent to exempt wildland firefighters from the hiring freeze,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Gutierrez said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything from the agency, whether they had filed an exemption or not, because there\u2019s been no communication,\u201d referring both to the Department of Interior and the Department of Agriculture.\n\nMcLane said the freeze has produced a \u201clingering uncertainty\u201d and anxiety among federal firefighters, who already work in dangerous, high-stress conditions, traveling across the country on short notice to battle dangerous wildfires.\n\n\u201cEmergency responders don\u2019t perform better when they are characters in political theater, and it feels like we are,\u201d he said.",

                "text": "DAYTON, Ohio AP \u2014\n\nAn Ohio city that was racked with chaos and threats last year related to an influx of Haitian immigrants filed a lawsuit on Thursday against a neo-Nazi group that it alleges was at the heart of the onslaught.\n\nThe city of Springfield, Mayor Rob Rue and several others sued the Blood Tribe, leaders Christopher Pohlhaus and Drake Berentz and seven unnamed followers in U.S. District Court in Dayton.\n\nThey accuse the group of \u201cengaging in, and inciting, a campaign of harassment and intimidation, motivated by ethnic and racial hatred, against those who supported Springfield\u2019s Haitian community in the face of Defendants\u2019 racist attacks.\u201d\n\nWith legal help from the Anti-Defamation League, the plaintiffs are asking the court for a jury trial seeking to block the group from making further threats and to impose damages.\n\nThe court file did not list an attorney for the Blood Tribe. Messages were left at phone numbers listed under Pohlhaus\u2019 and Berentz\u2019s names.\n\nSpringfield, a city of roughly 60,000 west of Columbus, has seen its Haitian population grow to about 10,000 people in recent years, as Haitians have fled violence in their home country in search of stability and employment. Their growing numbers caused friction with local residents, as schools, roads, hospitals and social programs were taxed by the large population \u2014 and, particularly, after a child was killed in 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driver hit a school bus.\n\nAs a candidate, Republican President Donald Trump honed worldwide attention on the city during a September presidential debate with Democratic rival Kamala Harris, when he amplified false claims that Springfield\u2019s Haitians were abducting and eating people\u2019s cats and dogs.\n\nThursday\u2019s complaint alleges that the Blood Tribe first coordinated a \u201chit\u201d against the city before that, in July, casting the influx of Haitians as an \u201cinvasion\u201d that was threatening Springfield\u2019s \u201cgood White residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cMembers of the Blood Tribe heeded the call,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cOver the next few months, the Blood Tribe and its members and associates unleashed a torrent of hateful conduct, including acts of harassment, bomb threats, and death threats, against Springfield residents who spoke out in support of the Haitian community.\u201d\n\nA Springfield police officer stands watch during a service in support of the Haitian community at St. Raphael Catholic church in Springfield, Ohio, on Septenber 15, 2024. Jessie Wardarski/AP\n\nThe Blood Tribe showed up at the city\u2019s jazz and blues festival in August, according to the court document, displaying guns, waving swastika flags and wearing matching red shirts, black pants and ski masks. They made their way to City Hall, where Berentz delivered a \u201cracist and antisemitic rant,\u201d to which followers responded with chants of \u201cSeig Heil\u201d and Nazi salutes.\n\nAdditional actions the lawsuit alleges against the group include harassing voicemails, hateful emails and social media posts demeaning the plaintiffs and their families. The complaint says that group members also used dating apps to send men looking for drugs and sex to the residents\u2019 homes late at night and publicized their personal information with the intent of getting others to join in the harassment.\n\nThe lawsuit makes no direct reference to Trump\u2019s remarks but notes that Pohlhaus \u201cgleefully took credit for the growing notoriety\u201d the false claims gained as they spread around the world after the debate.\n\nThe leader of a national advocacy group for Haitians sought to invoke a private-citizen right to file criminal charges against Trump and his then-running mate, Vice President JD Vance, shortly after the debate, alleging they played a role in the chaos and threats Springfield experienced.\n\nA panel of local judges decided in October to refer the matter to the county prosecutor for further investigation, rejecting the Haitian Bridge Alliance\u2019s call to issue arrest warrants or misdemeanor summonses to both men.\n\nThe alliance awaits a decision on an appeal it has filed in the Ohio Supreme Court. That lawsuit alleges that Clark County Municipal Court Judges Valerie Wilt, Daniel Carey and Stephen Schumaker \u201cpatently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction\u201d to meet as a group as they did when making the referral to the prosecutor.",

The man told police Vallere keeps \"multiple bats\" on her property. Police got a search warrant and found a black steel bat, which was collected as evidence.\n\nWhile the man was receiving medical treatment at a hospital, he told officers that he had forgotten to wash a pot and Vallere got mad and told him to wash it. He said no, and then, he told officers, she got the bat and started beating him. He got the injuries on his wrists when he raised his arms to protect his face from the bat, he told police.\n\nA physician at the emergency room confirmed for police that the man \"did suffer a few dislocated bones in his wrist and knees,\" and the man was transported to another hospital for surgery.\n\nRecords show that Vallere was booked into the St. Landry Parish jail, and appeared in court Friday morning for a magistrate's hearing. Her attorney is listed as Deuce Domengeaux, but when we called him he said he doesn't have the file yet and can't comment on the case.\n\nA Melville man whose mother died while living at Vallere's house has questions about what happened, but when we reached out to the St. Landry Parish Sheriff's Office they told us they investigated and there was no evidence of any wrong-doing.\n\nRecords show that Vallere was booked with principal to attempted second-degree murder in Avoyelles Parish back in 2023, but that charge was dismissed. Her son, Trevon Allen, was booked a few weeks later with attempted second-degree murder and aggravated assault, but those charges also were dismissed. Last fall, in November, she was indicted on a charge of illegal possession of a firearm and he was indicted on a charge of illegal use of weapons, Avoyelles records show.\n\nSt. Landry Parish records show that Allen had similar charges dismissed there; in March 2020 he was booked by Melville Police with three counts aggravated assault with a firearm, charges that were dismissed six weeks later.",

Like, no, it's not April Fools. I mean, just craziness!\" said Reynolds.\n\nAlong with the disbelief, there was downright dismay. Then a staffer \u2013 known as a \"Startender\" \u2013 knew just how to rally the Celestial Beerworks team.\n\n\"Hunter messaged us maybe like an hour or two later,\" said Reynolds, \"and was like, 'We need to do a beer called 'Sell the Team.'\"\n\nIt didn't take long for that idea to ferment. Sure, some would call it savvy marketing, but Hunter Ostdick said he's also a lifelong Mavericks fan.\n\n\"My dad has a photo of me at about two feet tall in a Jason Kidd jersey,\" said Ostdick. \"And now? There's a very deep pain in my heart right now. I don't trust what's going on. It feels like a very big betrayal,\" said Ostdick.\n\nFor Mavericks fans looking for something new to absorb those salty tears, 'Sell the Team' is in the tanks right now.\n\n\"Celestial is certainly known for our hazy IPAs, which are juicy, soft, typically very tropical tasting IPAs,\" said Reynolds. \"So we decided on making a double hazy IPA. One of our staff members, our cellarman Hayden, was like, 'oh, you need to make it 7.7 for the number 77,'\" said Reynolds.\n\nThe taproom is located near a DART train stop on the route to the American Airlines Center, so staffers said they are a regular watering hole for fans.\n\n\"Maybe excited is not the right word, but it seems like people are kind of commiserating with us,\" said Reynolds. \"Everyone is sending all their 'tears emojis' and 'oh my gosh, I'm so happy you're doing this.' Like, I need something to drown my sorrows. So whether it's excitement or just like misery loves company, we're certainly seeing a lot of interest either way,\" said Reynolds.\n\nThe Beerworks team wants to be clear that their love for Luka does not mean they're hating on the new big man in town, Anthony Davis.\n\n\"Anthony Davis is a great player,\" said Ostdick. \"Fantastic. All pro. He's great. And honestly, everything I've heard, he's a great guy as well. It's not about him. He got done dirty just like everybody else in this trade,\" said Ostdick.\n\nIt is, fans said, about missing Luka.\n\n\"We were spoiled,\" said Ostdick. \"We were spoiled with Mark. We were spoiled with Dirk. So I'm sure that plays into it because we thought he was going to be here. He wanted to be here. Like I said earlier, it's rare to find those guys that have that loyalty. There's only one Dirk, and there's only one Luka,\" said Ostdick.\n\n\"Sell the Team\" will be out of the tank and ready for fans to drown their sorrows on Feb. 21.\n\n\"Pour one out for the homie,\" said a still miserable Ostdick. \"Hopefully it'll at least give some people some comfort, because it is a potentially franchise-altering decision. You know?\"\n\nYes. We know. See you on the 21st.",

                "text": "(CBS DETROIT) \u2014 A 13-year-old boy suspected of committing a series of home invasions targeting young women in Pontiac and Detroit is in custody, Oakland County officials said.\n\nOakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard says investigators believe the suspect is responsible for upwards of 11 home invasions, including nine in Pontiac.\n\nThe suspect was expected to appear in court Friday afternoon.\n\nBouchard said a community member came forward after recognizing the teen in a photo, and that the suspect's parent has been cooperative in the investigation.\n\n\"Tragically, we've seen children do very dangerous and violent things, scary things. The moniker of a child doesn't necessarily mean they're not capable of doing something very terrible to another person, as we saw at Oxford High School,\" Bouchard said.\n\nDetectives have been investigating at least four attempted or successful home invasions that use similar methods. All four incidents have happened between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. since Dec. 23.\n\nThe most recent attempt happened around 4 a.m. on Feb. 4 in the 100 block of North Anderson Street. The sheriff's office said a man wearing a ski mask and armed with a knife choked a 10-year-old girl who had been sleeping. The girl screamed and the suspect was frightened off; the girl's mother saw the man running down the stairs and out of the home.\n\nThe girl was not injured.\n\n\"In terms of physical injuries, thank God we have very little, but obviously the emotional impact, when you're a child in your bedroom, the most safe and secure thing at home, there obviously has to be a process for them to deal with that trauma, that emotional trauma, that mental health. I think that's going to be the biggest, ongoing thing,\" Bouchard said.\n\nThe three other home invasions took place in the 600 block of Northway, 100 block of North Edith and 100 block of North Marshall. In each case, a person entered a home or attempted to gain entry through an unlocked window. The suspect appeared to target homes where teens or young girls lived. The suspect had a knife in three of the incidents.\n\nPrior home invasions with similar circumstances to these four recent cases are also under investigation, officials said. Some of the break-ins date back to 2022.\n\n\"I really felt it was important for the community to bring it down a notch in terms of their anxiety and fear,\" Bouchard said. \"This is the worst nightmare for any parent that somebody might be trying to climb in through a window to get after their kids, especially a young teenage girl.\"",

Photos and video taken at the dealership showed several Cybertrucks and other Teslas with red spray paint across the windshields and broken glass in the lot.\n\nThe Loveland Police Department said it's investigating the incident at 1606 North Lincoln Avenue as an act of vandalism and attempted arson that occurred around midnight on Thursday night or Friday morning.\n\n\"Various vehicles and the Tesla building were vandalized with graffiti, some of which were offensive and hateful in nature,\" the Loveland Police Department said in a statement. Similar incidents occurred at the dealership on Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, \"however, these incidents were of lesser magnitude than today's,\" the department said.\n\nLoveland police have since asked the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for assistance.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, as well as several vehicles in its lot, were spray painted on the morning of Friday, Feb. 7, 2024, according to police. Photos and video show vehicles with red spray paint on the windshield. CBS\n\nTeslas are equipped with eight or nine cameras, depending on model and year, that record the exterior of the car. While it's unclear if the cars in Colorado had the cameras on and recording, there have been at least two instances of people keying Teslas in Colorado that led to the arrests of the people accused of keying them -- one in Broomfield in 2019 and another in Thornton in 2021.\n\nThe company and individual Tesla owners have seen instances of alleged vandalism in the last few months, with local news outlets reporting incidents of vandalism to Tesla vehicles -- both at dealerships and in public -- in Florida, Oregon, Canada, and Australia.\n\nElon Musk -- the company's owner and richest person on earth, whose net worth is estimated at around $500 billion -- has been under scrutiny and on the receiving end of criticism in recent months and weeks for a variety of statements he's made, along with his support of President Trump and the German far-right AfD party, as well as establishing the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Musk has characterized DOGE as a \"cost-cutting\" tool for government spending, but raised concerns with transparency advocates, both in and out of government.\n\nSince kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.\n\nCritics of DOGE also say that Musk, who runs SpaceX, which receives billions of dollars in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.\n\nIn December, Musk responded to a note a Portland resident said was taped to his car, allegedly warning him about possible vandalism to it. In a reply on X, which Musk owns, he tweeted, \"Anyone who vandalizes a Tesla will have a criminal record. Go ahead, make my day;\" the second half of which is an apparent reference to the 1983 film \"Sudden Impact,\" in the \"Dirty Harry\" series, starring Clint Eastwood.\n\nCBS News producer Cesareo Sifuentes contributed to this report.",

                "text": "The first Altadena property with a home that was destroyed by the Eaton Fire in January has officially sold, just days after hitting the market. The sale comes amongst ongoing talks throughout the community that their neighborhoods are not for sale.\n\nBrock Harris, the agent who listed the home says that they had more than 100 interested buyers as soon as it was listed for sale, which he attributes to the fact that it's a flat, buildable lot in Los Angeles County \u2014 quite the rarity.\n\n\"Everyone here has three options: they can start trying to rebuild their house, they can wait and do nothing, or they can sell the lot and get on with their lives,\" Harris said.\n\nHe listed the Calaveras Street property, still full of ash and debris, for $449,000 last week. It sold for well over asking price, Harris said.\n\n\"Phone blew up. Twenty, thirty calls per day,\" he said. \"But, I think we priced it well, we ended up with a dozen offers. It was a very competitive situation, mostly from professional home builders.\"\n\nThe woman who owned the property said she didn't want to wait years to rebuild because she was renting the property out as an investment.\n\n\"There's this whole thing about, like, are developers going to ruin Altadena? Is someone gonna build it for themselves, or will an evil homebuilder buy it?,\" Harris said. \"But every call I got from people wanting to build homes, they want to build in Altadena and they want to build Altadena style homes.\"\n\nHe estimates that the city's comeback will likely be a mixture of families already in the area and professionals rebuilding at different paces.\n\nIt's just this, that has families like the Munoz'z concerned with the future of their city.\n\n\"It was a lot of family homes, it really sucks,\" said Jeanette Munoz, whose home was destroyed when the Eaton Fire erupted on Jan. 7, destroying thousands of homes and businesses. \"I am worried about it, but I hope they stick it out and rebuild stronger than ever.\"\n\nOn Saturday, community members gathered at an event encouraging fire victims not to sell their homes to developers.\n\nAll sporting shirts stating \"Altadena Not For Sale,\" they spoke to the crowd and pushed for people to continue the city's legacy, especially its Black neighborhoods.\n\nThey were joined by Grammy-nominated musician and Southern California native Aloe Blacc at the event. His children attend school in the area, which was burned down in the fire.\n\n\"I have so much love for Altadena,\" said Blacc, who's real name is Egbert Nathaniel Dawkins III. \"My goal is to use my influence and relationships I have to bring attention to Altadena, that it's not for sale, allow the families who were pushed here to the foothills because of restricted convenants, red lining, over years and years and decades, to continue to have their generational wealth and pass that down to their families.\"\n\n\"Now is the time to come together, now is not the time to sell,\" said Anthony McFarland, with Lift International Church. \"Now is not the time to sell your property for four hundred or five hundred thousand dollars, when developers already know your property two years from now, five years from now is double \u2014 triple \u2014 the value.\"\n\nThe event was planned after multiple residents reported being contacted in regards to their properties, less than a month after the fire first broke out.\n\n\"People right now are first being approached by vultures, who want to take our land, and we want to be sure that our voices are heard and that new build is inclusive of our right to return,\" said Heavenly Hughes, a community activist who helped plan the event.",

                "text": "Sacramento, California AP \u2014\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed laws Friday setting aside $50 million to help the state protect its policies from challenges by the Trump administration and defend immigrants amid the president\u2019s mass-deportation plans.\n\nOne of the laws allocates $25 million for the state Department of Justice to fight legal battles against the federal government, and another sets aside $25 million in part for legal groups to defend immigrants facing possible deportation.\n\nDuring his first presidency, President Donald Trump sparred with California over climate laws, water policy, immigrant rights and more, and the state filed or joined more than 100 legal actions against the administration. The same fights are reemerging in the early days of Trump\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cCalifornians are being threatened by an out-of-control administration that doesn\u2019t care about the Constitution and thinks there are no limits to its power,\u201d said Democratic Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThat is why we are delivering legislation that will allocate resources to defend Californians from this urgent threat.\u201d\n\nThe move comes a day after the Democratic governor returned from Washington, where he met with Trump and members of Congress to try to secure federal disaster aid for the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires that ripped through neighborhoods in January, killing more than two dozen people.\n\nNewsom signed a $2.5 billion package for fire relief into law last month to help fund the state\u2019s disaster response including evacuations, sheltering survivors and removing household hazardous waste. His administration has said they expect the federal government to reimburse the state.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized the funding for lawsuits, saying the focus on Trump is distracting as the Los Angeles area recovers from the fires.\n\n\u201cThis slush fund isn\u2019t about solving any real problems \u2014 it\u2019s a political stunt designed to distract from the urgent issues our state faces and it won\u2019t bode well for fire victims,\u201d Republican Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nCritics have also said the legislation doesn\u2019t ensure that funding wouldn\u2019t be used to defend immigrants without legal status who have been convicted of serious felonies.\n\nAfter signing the funding into law, Newsom said the money wasn\u2019t intended to be used for that purpose, and he encouraged lawmakers to pass subsequent legislation if clarifying that is needed. He said in a statement that the funding will assist legal groups in \u201csafeguarding the civil rights of California\u2019s most vulnerable residents.\u201d\n\nNewsom announced the plan to safeguard the state\u2019s policies days after Trump\u2019s election in November. He convened the Legislature in a special session to pass the bills.\n\nThe state is used to taking the federal government to court over Trump actions.\n\nCalifornia sued the Republican president\u2019s administration more than 120 times during his first term, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The state spent about $42 million overall on legal battles against the federal government, ranging from around $2 million to nearly $13 million a year.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA 6-year-old first grader in New York City has been asking to visit the school nurse almost every day for the last month, hoping to be sent home. Her teacher eventually figured out why.\n\n\u201cShe is afraid if she waits to the end of the day, she\u2019s not going to be able to see her mother \u2013 that something will happen and her mother will not be able to pick her up\u201d if she or family members are caught up in an immigration enforcement operation, Katie Kurjakovic, an English language learners specialist with the United Federation of Teachers, recalled a colleague telling her.\n\nIn New York and other cities across the nation, educators are grappling with fear among students and parents that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will show up at schools \u2013 or their homes \u2013 as the Trump administration vows to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cAll the teacher can do is to try to make this little girl feel as safe as possible,\u201d Kurjakovic told CNN. \u201cShe invites the girl to sit with her during as much of the day as possible \u2026 It\u2019s very upsetting, but it\u2019s what teachers are finding themselves having to do in the classroom \u2013 make kids feel safe.\u201d\n\nAnxiety around America\u2019s classrooms has only increased since the administration last month reversed a longstanding policy that directed immigration agents to avoid sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals \u2013 leaving educators scrambling for guidance on what to do if agents appear and how to reassure worried students and parents.\n\n\u201cCriminals will no longer be able to hide in America\u2019s schools and churches to avoid arrest,\u201d acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman said in a statement last month. \u201cThe Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\u201d\n\nThe White House and ICE, among several other federal agencies, have splashed multiple photos and videos of their enforcement actions on social media in a PR blitz intended to showcase the administration\u2019s deportation push.\n\nThere have been no confirmed reports of ICE agents at US schools, but educators said widespread alarm over deportations appears to have contributed to a recent drop in classroom attendance in some communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this terrible Charlie Brown rain cloud looming over everyone,\u201d said Deb Gesualdo, president of the teachers union in Malden, Massachusetts, a diverse, working-class city of about 65,000 north of Boston \u2013 where more than 70 languages are spoken in the public schools.\n\nIn Virginia, the president of the Fairfax County Federation of Teachers, David Walrod, said teachers are having to confront their students\u2019 traumatizing fears about deportations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s, you know, students not knowing, \u2018Is my best friend going to be here tomorrow?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a situation with somebody from law enforcement at a school, that\u2019s not just traumatizing to that one individual student they are getting, it\u2019s traumatizing to the thousands of other students that are also in the building and see what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u2018Everything is so topsy turvy\u2019\n\nProtesters opposed to immigration raids in schools outside the State Department of Education in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, last month. Nick Oxford/Reuters\n\nFrom Massachusetts to California, educators and advocates have been dispensing information to teachers and parents on the type of warrant ICE agents must have to gain access to schools and on the right all children have to an education regardless of immigration status and what to do and say in the event of an encounter.\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re teachers or support professionals, everyone is really, really worried,\u201d said Gesualdo, a music teacher with 22 years in the public school system. \u201cI have never seen or heard of anything like this \u2026 Everything is so topsy turvy.\u201d\n\nIn Malden, New York City and other places with large numbers of immigrant families, teachers and principals have been instructed to immediately contact district officials if federal agents appear on school grounds.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t get unfettered access. They don\u2019t get just free information handed to them,\u201d Gesualdo said of immigration agents. \u201cWe refer them to the superintendent\u2019s office \u2026 It would be so damaging for any of our students not only to be detained at school but to witness that happening.\u201d\n\nAbout 733,000 school-aged undocumented children live in the US, according to the Migration Policy Institute think tank.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell has put out guidance on how school officials should respond should immigration agents attempt to question or remove students. \u201cAs part of a school district\u2019s broader planning efforts related to circumstances that might make it unsafe for a child to return home, they should prepare for the event in which a parent is arrested or detained by ICE,\u201d the guidance states.\n\nGesualdo added, \u201cEven if there\u2019s no ICE raids happening in our schools and maybe there\u2019s no ICE agents lurking outside the schools, it still disrupts the school environment significantly. That fear of students possibly being taken from their families or students finding that while they were at school their parents were detained.\u201d\n\nNot all US education officials, however, oppose the Trump administration\u2019s push to allow ICE agents into schools. Ryan Walters, Oklahoma\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction, has vowed to comply with the efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the Oklahoma State Board of Education \u2013 which Walters oversees \u2013 voted in late January to approve a proposal requiring parents to report their immigration or citizenship status when enrolling their children in school. The proposal still needs the approval of the legislature and governor.\n\nA protester outside the State Department of Education in Oklahoma last month. Nick Oxford/Reuters\n\n\u201cSchools are crippled by the flood of illegal immigrants and the Biden/Harris open border policy. Oklahomans and the country elected President Trump and we will do everything possible to help put Oklahoma students first,\u201d Walters said in a statement.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know what the future holds\u2019\n\nIn New York City \u2013 where nearly 45,000 migrant children have enrolled in public schools since July 2022, according to the city Department of Education \u2013 Yensy Lopez said her three children have grown weary of random door knocks at a Manhattan hotel serving as a temporary shelter. She is worried even though she has a work permit and asylum proceedings in the works.\n\n\u201cThis has all been a psychological trauma for them and for me,\u201d the migrant from Colombia told CNN on a recent morning. \u201cI am just afraid. I don\u2019t know what the future holds.\u201d\n\nThousands of migrants began arriving in New York City in the summer of 2022 after being bused north from the Texas border. New York Mayor Eric Adams has been outspoken about the city\u2019s migrant crisis. He has expressed an openness to working with the Trump administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Adams was asked at a budget hearing before state legislators about children being afraid of going to school, he responded: \u201cI think that we need to let these children know that they can continue their education. Our administration has stated this over and over again.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s largest school system sent a memo to principals last month reiterating that ICE agents are not permitted on school grounds \u201cwithout proper legal authority.\u201d The letter also stressed the school system does not collect information about the immigration status of students.\n\nIn an email to members with information on New York City Department of Education guidance last week, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, Michael Mulgrew, wrote: \u201cWe will continue to fight for schools to remain safe zones. Our students deserve an education free from fear, humiliation and trauma.\u201d\n\nViridiana Carrizales, co-founder of ImmSchools, a nonprofit that works with schools across the country on ways to serve immigrant students and families, said the organization has been inundated in recent weeks with calls from worried parents and educators.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no place right now that is the safest for immigrant families, in many ways, schools are safer than even our own homes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re trying to tell families: Your kid might have more protections, or might be even safer at school than if you keep them at home.\u201d\n\nTeacher vows to protect kids \u2018by any means necessary\u2019\n\nIn Chicago, Chief Education Officer Bogdana Chkoumbova has said city public schools are committed to protecting students and families, and will not ask about or share immigration status with ICE. In November, the city board of education passed a resolution saying the school system will not assist ICE agents nor permit them on campuses without a criminal warrant.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday said the state will defend educators and immigrant students against Trump administration policies that have \u201ccreated fear and uncertainty in our immigrant communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s schools are and will remain a welcoming, inclusive and safe place for all, regardless of your sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status,\u201d Bonta told reporters. \u201cThe federal government does not dictate what we teach, and does not write our curricula. We do that here in California.\u201d\n\nDiana Herrera, a high school teacher from California\u2019s Central Valley, last week vowed to protect her students \u201cby any means necessary\u201d should ICE agents come to her classroom.\n\n\u201cWhether that\u2019s locking them out, pushing them away,\u201d she said. \u201cI just have a very big fear that they are going to come to my door and it is going to be, you know, me at the front line \u2026 I\u2019m going to protect my students and do what I can to keep them away.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion programs were created to help communities that have historically faced obstacles to equal opportunities in the workplace or felt a lack of belonging in majority-White corporate settings.\n\nThese programs expanded on the Civil Rights Act, signed in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, outlawing employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, color and national origin, experts say.\n\nCorporate America has long leveraged DEI programs to expand its customer base, increase profits, prevent discrimination lawsuits, and improve employee retention by fostering a more inclusive workplace.\n\nHowever, DEI programs implemented by federal agencies and corporations are now facing backlash from President Donald Trump and his conservative allies, who argue diversity hiring practices disregard merit.\n\nEliminating or scaling back DEI will jeopardize programs that have helped many underserved groups receive a fair shot at opportunities and feel more embraced in the workplace, advocates of DEI say.\n\nOne of DEI\u2019s fiercest critics is Elon Musk, who wrote in an X post last year, \u201cDEI is just another word for racism.\u201d\n\nThe scope of DEI programs goes far beyond leveling the playing field for Black and brown people.\n\nHere are some other groups benefitting from DEI:\n\nWhite women\n\nWhite women have been one the biggest beneficiaries of diversity programs in the workplace, experts on DEI say.\n\nMany companies have launched initiatives to give women a fair shot at leadership roles, close the gender pay gap, and offer paid parental leave and flexibility for employees with children, said Haley Lickstein, a political consultant and advocate for youth political engagement.\n\nWhite women have taken advantage of these programs, which in turn have helped their careers, Lickstein said.\n\n\u201cI think White women oftentimes don\u2019t recognize how much DEI initiatives have impacted their ability to rise in leadership levels and have a more equitable playing field,\u201d Lickstein said.\n\nAccording to the job search site Zippia, 76% of chief diversity officer roles are held by White people, and 54% are held by women.\n\nScaling back DEI programs and offices could mean the loss of the teams and people who advocated for these programs, Lickstein said.\n\n\u201cNow we are rolling back these DEI initiatives without recognizing that so many top-tier employees and talent were drawn to the company because of these benefits,\u201d Lickstein said.\n\nWomen have also benefited from efforts to ensure there are comfortable lactation rooms for breastfeeding moms in the office, said Rafael Fantauzzi, who has worked in executive DEI roles for the last eight years.\n\nLactation rooms at some companies have resulted from DEI efforts aimed at improving workplace culture and complying with the Fair Labor Standards Act. This act requires employers to allow a reasonable break time for employees to express breast milk and an area to pump milk \u2014 other than a bathroom \u2014 that protects them from the view or intrusion of coworkers, Fantauzzi said.\n\n\u201cWe build those things so that they can have a better experience in the workplace,\u201d he added.\n\nLGBTQ+ people\n\nThe LGBTQ+ community has also benefitted from DEI programs in the workplace.\n\nMany companies have recognized Pride Month, which is observed in June and celebrates the contributions and historic impact lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have had on the nation.\n\nMajor corporations such as Adobe and Bain & Company have hosted Pride networking events, panel discussions, fundraisers for LGBTQ+ charities and mentorship programs.\n\nRetailers such as Target have rolled out LGBTQ+-themed products for Pride Month to appeal to a wider customer base. However, Target scaled back those products last year following a boycott from right-wing activists.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups, or ERGs, have been tasked with ensuring LGBTQ+ employees feel safe and included at work, said Alvin Tillery, director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University.\n\nERGs at companies like Netflix have pushed for expanded health care benefits and support for transgender employees.\n\n\u201cThey (ERGs) are doing a lot of work to make sure there are policies in place,\u201d Tillery said.\n\nAnd in the last decade, more companies have embraced using pronouns in the workplace to show support for transgender and non-binary employees. Pronouns are commonly found in email signatures with \u201che/him\u201d \u201cshe/her\u201d and \u201cthey/them.\u201d\n\nThe use of pronouns helps prevent the misgendering of LGBTQ+ people, which the Human Rights Campaign says can be \u201churtful, angering, and even distracting.\u201d\n\nFamilies who need IVF\n\nDEI programs and employee resource groups have also played a significant role in ushering in health insurance coverage for employees needing fertility treatments.\n\nEmployees of all races, genders, ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations want to build families, said David Adamson, founder and CEO of Arc Fertility. However, 1 in 6 couples will face infertility, he said.\n\n\u201cFamily forming benefits are there for everyone, it\u2019s not trying to benefit one group over another,\u201d Adamson said.\n\nIn recent years, more corporations have expanded health coverage to include IVF along with donor sperm and donor eggs, Adamson said. Tech companies have led the way in providing these benefits, a benefit he believes helps retain employees.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s good evidence that this creates increased loyalty of employees,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployees are more likely to stay at their company and more likely to say that their company is a good company.\u201d\n\nDisabled people\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\nDEI efforts in the workplace have helped defend those protections and train disabled people in the workforce.\n\nLast year, the US Department of Education\u2019s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services donated nearly $10 million to Florida Atlantic University to train disabled people for high-demand technology jobs.\n\nIn 2019 \u2014 during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 the Federal Aviation Administration launched a pilot program to train people with disabilities for jobs in air traffic control.\n\nUnitedHealth Group\u2019s Engagement, Inclusion and Diversity Center of Excellence rolled out a Disability Inclusion Internship Program in 2020. The program provided hands-on training and mentorship to prepare interns for corporate roles at the company.\n\nMany workplaces have yet to fully enforce anti-discrimination laws, and DEI professionals are working to change that, said Stacy Hawkins, a professor at Rutgers University Law School and a DEI consultant.\n\n\u201cThese are communities that have really been sidelined,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cSo, there really was not a lot of access in the workplace and the inclusive opportunities in the workplace for those populations until diversity efforts came along.\u201d\n\nVeterans\n\nVeterans may also receive preferential hiring in some state and federal agencies, Tillery said.\n\n\u201cVeterans who are disabled, who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are entitled to preference over others in hiring for virtually all federal government jobs,\u201d according to the US Department of Labor.\n\nErnst & Young is among the corporations that have special programs to help employees who are veterans connect and feel more included.\n\nThe company hosts career fairs, panel discussions, networking events and peer mentoring programs for veterans, according to its website.\n\nErnst & Young also partners with the United Service Organizations to support professional development and potential employment for veterans transitioning into the civilian world.\n\nSome companies also provide mental health services for employees who are veterans \u2014 something DEI teams advocate for, Lickstein said.\n\nStarbucks also boasts its support for veterans. The coffee chain says it has hired more than 40,000 veterans and military spouses since 2013, provided 80 hours of pay for employees when military service obligations take them away from work and donated to the Wounded Warrior Project.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA regional airline flight that disappeared in Alaska Thursday has been found and all 10 people who were aboard are dead, the US Coast Guard said Friday.\n\nThe small commuter aircraft was found Friday about 34 miles southeast of Nome, the flight\u2019s intended destination, according to the USCG.\n\nTwo rescue swimmers identified three bodies inside the plane and the seven others \u201care believed to be inside the wreckage,\u201d but they are inaccessible at this time, USCG Lt. Commander Mike Salerno told CNN.\n\nAmong the deceased are two employees from Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson, who traveled to Unalakleet \u201cto service a heat recovery system that is critical to the community\u2019s water plant,\u201d the nonprofit said Friday night.\n\n\u201cRhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson were passionate about the work they did, cared deeply for the communities they served, and made a lasting impact on rural communities across our state,\u201d Natasha Singh, ANTHC interim president and CEO, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey were the best at what they did and had just flown into Unalakleet to help address heating and mechanical issues in the depths of winter. They gave the ultimate sacrifice for the people we serve in the work we do.\u201d\n\nThe Cessna aircraft, operated by Bering Air and carrying nine passengers and a pilot, disappeared Thursday afternoon while heading from Unalakleet to Nome \u2013 cities in western Alaska separated by the Norton Sound inlet \u2013 according to the Alaska State Troopers. It was about 12 miles offshore when its position was lost, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nThe aircraft \u201cexperienced some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed\u201d around 3:18 p.m. local time Thursday, Coast Guard Lt. Commander Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said.\n\nA photo shared by the Coast Guard shows the aircraft broken into pieces in a snowy terrain. \u201cOur thoughts are with those affected by this tragic incident,\u201d the USCG said on X.\n\nThe search for the aircraft had been complicated by the fact that the missing plane had not communicated its position through an emergency transmitter, officials said.\n\nSearchers had scoured the snowy ground in the Nome area and sea ice offshore, authorities have said. Poor weather conditions hindered searches by air Thursday, and initial search flights by C-130 crews from the Coast Guard and US Air Force turned up nothing, the Nome Volunteer Fire Department said Friday morning.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration \u201cis providing an investigator from the Aviation Safety Office of Accident and Prevention,\u201d as well as local support from the FAA\u2019s aviation safety inspectors.\n\n\u201cSay a prayer tonight for the 10 souls who lost their lives on the Bering Air flight in Alaska,\u201d Duffy said in a statement on X.\n\nAt a news conference Friday before officials said a plane was found, McIntyre-Coble said there was \u201csome sort of item of interest\u201d identified by an aircraft involved in the search efforts, and the Coast Guard was heading to its location.\n\nVisibility was better for searchers Friday morning: The sky was clear at Nome Airport around 10 a.m., with temperatures of around 5 degrees. The National Guard and Coast Guard added helicopter search teams to the effort Friday morning, while another Coast Guard C-130 landed in Nome to assist with the search, the fire department said.\n\nAll families of passengers on the missing flight \u201chave been notified,\u201d the fire department said Friday, without elaborating; no names have been released. The passengers on the plane are all adults, Alaska State Troopers Lt. Ben Endres said at the news conference.\n\n\u201cPlease keep families in your thoughts at this time,\u201d the fire department said.\n\nThe tragedy comes as US air safety is under scrutiny as investigators probe two deadly incidents from last week: a January 29 midair collision of a US military Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet near Washington, DC, that left 67 people dead; and a January 31 crash of a medevac jet in Philadelphia that killed seven.\n\nThe plane did not communicate through an emergency locator transmitter, a device that can broadcast distress signals to help locate downed aircraft, the fire department said Friday.\n\nEvery plane has an emergency locater transmitter, which is a device that, if exposed to seawater, sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard if there\u2019s an aircraft \u201cin distress,\u201d McIntyre-Coble said.\n\n\u201cThere have been no ELT notifications to the United States Coast Guard. Why that has occurred, or why that hasn\u2019t occurred is, not something that we\u2019re entirely clear about,\u201d according to McIntyre-Coble.\n\nThe FBI was assisting the search with technical resources, including working to geolocate the cell phones of the plane\u2019s passengers, a bureau spokesperson told CNN. FBI field offices have personnel specially trained in analyzing cellular telephone tower data, which can assist authorities in geolocating the last registered location of a device.\n\nDetails of disappearance\n\nThe plane missing in Alaska, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, was last seen over the Norton Sound around 3:16 p.m. Thursday, data from flight tracker FlightRadar 24 shows. Around that time, light snow was reported at Nome Airport with temperatures around 14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe plane\u2019s pilot had told air traffic control that he intended to enter a holding pattern while waiting for a runway to be cleared, the Nome Volunteer Fire Department said.\n\nOn Thursday evening, hours after contact was lost, conditions around Nome Airport included light snow and freezing drizzle. At one point, visibility was down to half a mile, with forecasts of wind gusts up to 35 mph overnight.\n\n\u201cIf that bad weather coated the wings with ice \u2026 the performance of the aircraft would degrade, and it could stall and crash,\u201d CNN aviation analyst Miles O\u2019Brien said Friday morning. \u201cBut there are places where the ice (in the sea below) is actually thick enough to support the craft, so that should give searchers some bit of hope.\u201d\n\nFirst responders urged the public not to form their own search parties due to the weather and safety concerns.\n\nBering Air is based in Nome and serves more than 30 local communities, according to its website.\n\n\u201cStaff at Bering Air is working hard to gather details, get emergency assistance, search and rescue going,\u201d said David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air, the Associated Press reported. CNN has sought comment from Bering Air, which has been operating in Alaska since 1979.\n\nA fire department crew also was headed down the coast Friday morning to cover ground inland and along the coastline, the department said. The Coast Guard was planning to drop a buoy in the water to track and monitor ice movement to inform their search, the fire department said.\n\nHospitals were gearing up in case they needed to respond, with the Norton Sound Health Corp. \u201cStanding ready to respond to a community medical emergency,\u201d it said. The Norton Sound Regional Hospital also set up a family center for loved ones of the passengers to gather while waiting for news.\n\nAlaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and his wife \u201care heartbroken by the loss of the 10 people on the Bering Air flight,\u201d he said Friday in a post on X.\n\n\u201cOur prayers are with the families, friends, and communities mourning this tragedy,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe are grateful to the search teams who worked tirelessly to locate the aircraft. I ask all Alaskans to keep those affected in their thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Robert Shackelford, Amanda Jackson, Josh Campbell, Jeremy Harlan and Martin Goillandeau contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe year\u2019s first deadly US tornado struck after dark Thursday, killing two people in a small East Tennessee community as the first of five back-to-back, jet stream-driven winter storms pummeled the eastern United States.\n\nSevere weather blasted through Morgan County, killing a mother and daughter in the same home, the county Emergency Management & Homeland Security office said Friday. No ages or other identifying information were given.\n\nThree injuries also were reported, the agency said, in a county that is no stranger to deadly and damaging tornadoes. More than a dozen homes were damaged by the storm, county officials said Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThat community in particular is for whatever reason a hotbed for that kind of activity,\u201d county emergency management spokesperson Aaron Evans said. \u201cThey\u2019re resilient people \u2026 they\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nThe Morgan County tornado \u2013 with a preliminary intensity of EF2, according to the National Weather Service \u2013 slammed the small communities of Deer Lodge and Sunbright around 8:27 p.m. and caused \u201csevere property damage,\u201d according to the county. The twister in Deer Lodge had a maximum wind speed of 135 mph, a weather service survey team found \u2013 just 1 mph shy of EF3 strength, to which it still could be upgraded.\n\n\u201cIt, honest to God, sounded like a freight train coming through the area,\u201d Morgan County resident Chas Vinal told CNN affiliate WVLT.\n\nMore than 100 emergency responders were deployed in the county, the emergency management office said, including dozens from a Tennessee Highway Patrol strike team, who will \u201clook for any people that are missing, and we assist in any way we can,\u201d said state Highway Patrol Capt. Stacey Heatherly.\n\nAn EF1 tornado, meanwhile, also hit Thursday night in the community of Thorn Hill in Grainger County, Tennessee, northeast of Knoxville and about 100 miles east by road from Deer Lodge, the weather service said. It was only the fourth confirmed tornado in the county on record, according to the weather service. Several buildings and vehicles had moderate damage, and no one was injured, county Emergency Management Director Jeff Atkins told CNN.\n\nA family of farmers in Grainger County said four of their buildings were damaged or destroyed, WVLT reported.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was bad, but we didn\u2019t realize it was this bad,\u201d Bob Coffey told WVLT. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s debris all in the hay fields and the pasture fields and I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll ever get it all picked up.\u201d\n\nFallen trees lay against a home Thursday in Deer Lodge, Tennessee, after an EF2 tornado struck. WVLT\n\nAs daylight arrived Friday, damage assessments in Morgan County began.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get a better picture of what the scene looks like, how much damage there is,\u201d Evans told WVLT. \u201cTeams will be able to get a better grip and grasp on the area to see how many homes were damaged.\u201d\n\nGov. Bill Lee visited Morgan County Friday to tour the destruction wrought by the tornado.\n\nGov. Bill Lee speaks with residents of Twin Bridge Road while on a tour of tornado damage in Morgan County, Tennessee on February 7, 2025. Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel/USA Today Network/Imagn Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking but also heartening to see how friends and neighbors have been coming out to serve,\u201d he told WVLT. \u201cThis is a remarkable place and a remarkable people. The people here are inspiring.\u201d\n\nNearly 2% of Morgan County had no power as of Friday evening, down from 8% earlier in the day, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe damaging winds had arrived more than two hours after sunset, making it hard for residents to see the danger. Nighttime tornadoes are twice as likely to be deadly as those occurring during the day, a 2022 study found.\n\nFebruary tornadoes are not rare, but they are less common than in spring. February saw 45 tornadoes last year across the country, compared with 527 in May.\n\nWhile Tennessee averages three tornadoes in February, Thursday\u2019s was the first in the month in Morgan County, the National Weather Service office in Morristown said. East Tennessee has only had 12 tornadoes on record in February, with the last one being 14 years ago in 2011, the weather service said.\n\nSeveral tornadoes have touched down in Morgan County since 1965, including an F3 in 2002, which killed seven people some 20 miles southeast of Deer Lodge and an EF1 tornado last year in Sunbright.\n\nResidents assist in clean up off of Twin Bridge Road in Morgan County, Tennessee on February 7, 2025.

                "text": "New Orleans CNN \u2014\n\nJust before 9 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day, a server working off Bourbon Street traversed the maze of blocked streets and the army of law enforcement that had swarmed the French Quarter just a few hours earlier after an ISIS-inspired ramming attack.\n\nShe was trying to find a way to work.\n\nPart of Bourbon Street would be closed for another day as police combed the scene and recovered the 14 victims\u2019 bodies. The street, famous for debauchery and celebration, wouldn\u2019t fully reopen until their blood was pressure-washed from the pavement. In the meantime, tourists needed a place to eat and drink.\n\nHundreds of dollars in tips rolled in that day, recalls this server, who doesn\u2019t want to be named so she could speak candidly. But the money was little consolation for what she felt was some customers\u2019 callous attitudes.\n\n\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d she says, gesturing to the restaurant\u2019s second floor, where its wrought iron balcony juts over the sidewalk. \u201cI had customers that crowded to the end of the balcony to take pictures of the dead body that was halfway down the street in plain view, broad daylight, for half the f**king day.\u201d\n\nSince then, hospitality and service workers across the French Quarter have navigated a strange dissonance, grappling with the emotional and financial fallout of an assault that hit so close to home while putting on a smile to do what they do so well: Show tourists a good time in a romanticized city that could live or die by their spending.\n\n\u201cWe know who makes this city run,\u201d says Ashley Zoerner, a stand-up comic who sometimes gigs in the French Quarter and is among its nearly 4,000 residents.\n\nFor bartenders, servers, business owners, managers and performers here, there has been scant opportunity to process the New Year\u2019s attack. They jumped right back into the college football Sugar Bowl frenzy, then the weekslong Carnival season. Now, tens of thousands of fans are descending for Super Bowl LIX, with security hitting a fever pitch.\n\nMore than a month after a US Army veteran careened his pickup down Bourbon Street \u2013 and just as New Orleans begins playing host to America\u2019s signature pro sports and cultural extravaganza \u2013 there are few signs left of the attack, save the memorial at the corner of Canal Street, where the assault began.\n\nIt\u2019s a solemn place where visitors quietly pay their respects, whispering and taking photos of 14 crosses standing sentry. At their feet are piles of wilting bouquets alongside overturned, unlit prayer candles, all contained behind New Orleans police barriers wrapped in Mardi Gras beads.\n\nBut a block downriver, Bourbon Street is bustling, catering again to the Sisyphean stream of tourists who, as the weeks tick by, are increasingly removed from the attack. Out-of-towners crowd the sidewalk to listen to a brass band, the trombones, trumpets and saxophone blaring over the march of the tuba and percussion. A kid in a Philadelphia Eagles T-shirt dances in the street.\n\nSome workers welcome the routine. This is just how things are done in New Orleans\u2019 most famous neighborhood. Plus, they have to make a living: slinging cocktails, taking orders, giving cemetery tours, deejaying, performing.\n\nNone faults visitors for wanting to enjoy themselves. But more than one uses the term \u201cjaded.\u201d The server who went to work in those hours after the attack has one wish: that tourists would be more \u201cmindful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be f**king callous,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are people that work here every day, that live here, that have to be here \u2013 and continue dealing with the aftermath.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See how Homeland Security is ramping up for New Orleans Super Bowl 03:03 - Source: CNN See how Homeland Security is ramping up for New Orleans Super Bowl 03:03\n\n\u2018How are you going to bounce back\u2019\n\nTammi Diddley smokes a cigarette behind the wheel of her Ford pickup, taking a break from busking. She\u2019s making do, for the moment, with an incomplete drum kit: no toms, no hi-hat.\n\nTammi Diddley performs Sunday on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nSt. Louis Cathedral stands Monday in Jackson Square in the French Quarter. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nShe was out here on Bourbon Street on New Year\u2019s Eve, she says, and it was packed. And she\u2019d set up right here, feet from the end of the 300 block of Bourbon Street, she recalls.\n\nBut in the wee hours of 2025, \u201cI got that funny feeling,\u201d Diddley says, \u201clike the hair stands up on the back of your neck.\u201d\n\nShe packed up and went home.\n\nZoerner, the comic, was asleep in her studio apartment feet from Bourbon Street, she remembers. Her mom and teenage nephews were camped out on a futon and the floor when they heard the attacker\u2019s 6,000-pound, electric Ford F-150 speed down the road before hitting a cherry picker. Then came the sound of gunfire from police, who killed the armed assailant.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d one of the teens asked. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for her relatives\u2019 visit, Zoerner might have been out there amid the carnage, she recalls over a traditional Monday meal of red beans and rice as a fellow comic prepares a late show-style monologue for a head-to-head competition.\n\nZoerner still wonders about a girl she saw earlier that night who had money pinned to her clothes \u2013 a New Orleans birthday tradition \u2013 and was bound with friends for Bourbon Street.\n\n\u201cAll I can think is, \u2018Man, I really hope those people are OK.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Diddley learned of the attack, she wept, wondering whether she could have changed something if she\u2019d stayed. But today, with the sun shining, the crowds humming and music blaring from seemingly every bar \u2013 so loud she can hardly be heard \u2013 she feels safe.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be out here playing drums in high heels if it wasn\u2019t safe, honey,\u201d she says.\n\nZoerner, who also tends bar and gives tours in the nearby Trem\u00e9 neighborhood, acknowledges it has been difficult at times since the attack to get on stage and do stand-up. She\u2019s never sure whether she should mention the attack.\n\n\u201cIf you do address it,\u201d she asks, \u201chow are you going to bounce back from that and turn it into your material?\u201d\n\nBut for her community, comedy is cathartic and therapeutic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware this sad thing happened,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying in any way to diminish that. But now we\u2019re going to do what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in mourning \u2026 thank you for coming\u2019\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t not do this,\u201d says Toast Korozsia, interrupting himself mid-sentence to point out a building on Exchange Alley \u2013 a quiet pedestrian walkway \u2013 that once belonged to the French impressionist painter Edgar Degas.\n\nKorozsia is a haunted history tour guide, and he\u2019s first to point out he looks the part, with silver piercings in his nose and ears, and long black hair matching his black jeans, shirt and vest. But his work goes beyond cemetery and true crime tours: He\u2019s a cultural ambassador (it says so on his business card), committed to showing tourists what makes New Orleans New Orleans, where he moved from Chicago seven years ago.\n\nToast Korozsia poses Sunday for a portrait in New Orleans. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nSince New Year\u2019s, Korozsia has started his tours acknowledging the \u201ctragedy\u201d in the not-so-distant past, he explains.\n\n\u201cWe just had a terrible tragedy down here,\u201d he\u2019ll tell tour groups. \u201cWe\u2019re in mourning, but thank you for coming \u2026 We\u2019re going to give you a good time, because that\u2019s what we do. But understand, this is not the way that we usually are.\u201d\n\nPeople have been understanding for the most part. But Korozsia also believes tourists\u2019 behavior has deteriorated in recent years, exhibiting what he feels is a \u201clack of respect for people that live down here.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople behave here in ways that they would never behave in other places,\u201d he says, adding he has kicked people off tours for peeing on buildings.\n\nStill, \u201cif it were not for tourists,\u201d Korozsia says, \u201cwe don\u2019t get to work.\u201d\n\nIn the days after the attack, Mark Schettler heard the jokes made on Bourbon Street by tourists who had drunk too much, he says. It bothered Schettler, the executive director of Shift Change, a nonprofit that supports service industry workers.\n\nBut he also recognized it as a way for visitors to cope with partying in a place where so much mayhem just unfolded. And at least they were here, he says, giving their business.\n\n\u201cI would rather have (a tourist) on Bourbon Street who\u2019s being an idiot in the street than being scared of us at home.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not something we want to tell people\u2019\n\nSince the attack, some workers have been \u201cresentful at times\u201d toward tourists. But their manager at a Bourbon Street business feels differently, he says, likening himself instead to a \u201cmother hen\u201d shielding customers from what he\u2019s going through.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s, like, a little ball of anxiety that forms in the pit of my stomach, and I just sort of carry that around all day,\u201d says the manager, who also asks not to be identified so he could speak openly. His customers seemingly have no idea, and he\u2019d like to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cThey have no idea a body was there two weeks ago,\u201d he says of Bourbon Street. \u201cThey have no idea. And why should they? It\u2019s not something we want to tell people, right?\u201d\n\nNew Orleans is known for being \u201cresilient,\u201d says Olivia McCoy, a former service industry worker who founded WeHelp NOLA, an organization that, for a small fee, helps partner businesses give employees access to mental health services. But people are tired, she says, of being resilient, of having to \u201cforge ahead\u201d in the face of painful events.\n\nSince the New Year\u2019s violence, WeHELP \u2013 through fundraising and donations \u2013 has been able to open its services to all impacted workers, she says, regardless of whether they\u2019re members.\n\nAt first, many were concerned about safety and the threat of a copycat attack, McCoy says. Now, they\u2019re \u201cdealing with the residual effects of how that affected them, mentally and emotionally \u2013 and also how it may affect them financially moving forward.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement personnel patrol Monday in the French Quarter. Austin Steele/CNN\n\n\u2018Never been as stressed \u2026 as I am now\u2019\n\nSome wish Bourbon Street had stayed closed longer than it did. Jamaal Robinson, who emcees at a karaoke bar under the alias DJ Rooster, isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\u201cWe bounce back from stuff like this really quick. It might sound callous, but we just understand the reality of things, that life has to move on,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cWe all work service industry. If nobody was here, we was all broke. Bills ain\u2019t gonna stop.\u201d\n\nThat reality is all too apparent to business owners who say their numbers are down, though it\u2019s difficult to know how much the downturn owes to the New Year\u2019s attack or to mid-January\u2019s once-in-a-generation winter storm.\n\nThe snow didn\u2019t help \u2013 but it at least forced Dominic Hernandez, the owner of The Double Club, to finally take a break.\n\nEven the attack hadn\u2019t forced him to close, the Angeleno says as he gets ready for a West Coast taco night, among events he orchestrated in recent weeks to bring in the \u201cnormal\u201d amount of money (there was also the Roan of Arc party \u2013 a Chappell Roan-themed bash to coincide with the Joan of Arc parade, among the first this Carnival season \u2013 and a paint-and-sip night).\n\n\u201cWe put a lot of effort into these events, and maybe the turnouts aren\u2019t as good as they can be, but we\u2019re hitting the numbers we need to at least get by,\u201d Hernandez says. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to be grateful for because it\u2019s something we\u2019re putting our all into.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kirk Estopinal, a partner with Cure Collective, is \u201cneedling\u201d his restaurant Cane and Table \u2013 several blocks downriver of Jackson Square, where the St. Louis Cathedral this week is lit up for a Super Bowl-themed light show \u2013 at a level he never has before. The native New Orleanian tries to calculate what the restaurant might pull in each day, then whose dinner shift to cut, trying his best to be even-handed so everyone can make a living.\n\n\u201cLiterally, I have never been as stressed about this restaurant as I am now,\u201d he says, estimating he\u2019s down about 40% compared with last January.\n\nA dip is to be expected. The French Quarter hosts \u201cseasonal\u201d business, with purveyors building up reserves in busy periods to carry them through slow ones. But so far, Estopinal hasn\u2019t built his coffer back up, he says.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s hard to say how much this is due to the attack. But Estopinal bases how tourists might feel on the opinions of people he knows living across the Mississippi River, in the suburbs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re constantly asking me, \u2018How is it? Do you feel safe?\u2019 Because they\u2019re worried,\u201d he says, noting he does not feel unsafe and the police chief last year touted a 35% annual drop in murders and a 26% drop in crime overall.\n\nEstopinal now fears the notion of New Orleans as dangerous will get cemented in outsiders\u2019 minds, particularly if anything remotely violent happens around the Super Bowl or Mardi Gras season. A shooting, for example, that would otherwise warrant a couple minutes on the local news would take on outsized significance.\n\n\u201cThat would be really bad, like, the pattern of it happening,\u201d Estopinal says. \u201cIt may not even be a big, giant deal, but if it\u2019s remotely scary, it\u2019s going to be everywhere, and that worries me, because then it reinforces that fear.\u201d\n\n\u2018The river\u2019s gonna keep flowing\u2019\n\nNo fewer than four people approach Waites Laseter within a few minutes late on a recent night, hugging him or lighting a cigarette, so well-known is he along this stretch of Chartres Street between Canal and Iberville, where he\u2019s a bartender at the Mahogany Jazz Hall.\n\nWaites Laseter poses Monday at Sneaky Pete\u2019s in New Orleans' French Quarter. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nLaseter\u2019s not working tonight, but he\u2019s still around. He\u2019s worked at most of these places and estimates he\u2019s been fired from at least half. These bartenders know his drink of choice \u2013 a shot of Campari \u2013 and he\u2019s here so often, it\u2019s where he gets his Amazon packages delivered instead of to his home, several blocks deeper into the French Quarter.\n\nIt was this community that was Laseter\u2019s first thought the morning after the New Year\u2019s attack as he, too, maneuvered to get here and check on everyone.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help but laugh at what he saw along the way.\n\n\u201cThe absurdity of New Orleans \u2026 continuing on around me,\u201d he recalls: A family on vacation taking a group photo near the scene of the attack; a man with a card table hawking Sugar Bowl T-shirts stamped with the wrong date after the massacre postponed the game. \u201cAnd none of it really makes sense, except the fact that it\u2019s not supposed to make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in the face of absolutely abhorrent tragedies, there\u2019s always going to be that thing of humor. It\u2019s such an inherent part of the coping mechanism of existence period for anybody, I think,\u201d he says, \u201cbut even more so in a town that\u2019s built on over-flavoring, on abundance, that\u2019s built on indulgence.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still jarring, yes, Laseter says, to see the police and drug-sniffing dogs beneath a flood light at the end of the street as the Super Bowl security ramps up. But New Orleans is tenacious, he says, like the jazz musician in the hall several doors down who\u2019s studied his instrument since his dad put it in his hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unstoppable. It\u2019s unquenchable,\u201d he says of the city. Put simply: \u201cThe river\u2019s gonna keep flowing.\u201d",

                "text": "Atmore, Alabama AP \u2014\n\nA man convicted of murdering a woman after breaking into her apartment as she slept was put to death Thursday evening in Alabama in the nation\u2019s fourth execution using nitrogen gas.\n\nDemetrius Frazier, 52, was pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m. at a south Alabama prison for his murder conviction in the 1991 rape and killing of Pauline Brown, 41. It was the first execution in Alabama this year and the third in the US in 2025, following a lethal injection Wednesday in Texas and another last Friday in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to apologize to the family and friends of Pauline Brown. What happened to Pauline Brown should have never happened,\u201d Frazier said in his final words. He finished by saying, \u201cI love everybody on death row. Detroit Strong.\u201d\n\nFrazier in his final words also criticized Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for what he called her failure to step in following appeals for him to be returned to serve out a previous life sentence in her state.\n\nRecently, Frazier\u2019s mother and death penalty opponents had pleaded to Whitmer to take Frazier back to his home state of Michigan to complete his life sentence for the murder of a teenage girl before he was turned over years ago to Alabama authorities. Michigan does not have the death penalty. Police had said Frazier confessed to killing Brown in 1992 while in custody in Michigan.\n\nWhitmer told The Detroit News before the execution that her predecessor, Rick Snyder, \u201cunfortunately\u201d agreed to send Frazier to Alabama and it was in the hands of officials there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough situation,\u201d she told the media outlet. \u201cI understand the pleas and concerns. Michigan is not a death penalty state.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said that on November 27, 1991, Frazier, then 19, broke into Brown\u2019s apartment in Birmingham while she was asleep. Prosecutors said he demanded money and raped Brown at gunpoint after she gave him $80 from her purse. He then shot her in the head and returned later to have a snack and look for money, they said.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a post-execution statement that justice was done.\n\n\u201cIn Alabama, we enforce the law. You don\u2019t come to our state and mess with our citizens and get away with it,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cRapists and murderers are not welcome on our streets, and tonight, justice was carried out for Pauline Brown and her loved ones.\u201d\n\nFrazier was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan for the 1992 murder of Crystal Kendrick, 14. Then in 1996, an Alabama jury convicted him of murdering Brown and recommended by a vote of 10-2 that he receive a death sentence. Frazier remained in Michigan custody until 2011 when the then-governors of the two states agreed to move him to Alabama\u2019s death row. Frazier suggested in his final statement that his confession to the killing of the Michigan girl was false.\n\nAlabama became the first state to conduct nitrogen gas executions, putting three people to death last year with the method. It involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person\u2019s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen. Frazier, like the first three people to be executed by the method, shook or quivered on the gurney, although to a lesser degree than the others.\n\nFrazier was strapped to a gurney with a blue-rimmed gas mask covering his entire face. The execution began at about 6:10 p.m. after a corrections officer did a final check of the mask.\n\nFrazier moved his outstretched palms in a swirling circular movement for the first minute or two. At 6:12 p.m., he stopped circling his hands. He appeared to grimace, quiver on the gurney and take a gasping breath. A minute later, he raised both legs several inches off the gurney and then lowered them.\n\nHis breathing slowed at 6:14 p.m. to a series of sporadic breaths. He had no visible movement by about 6:21 p.m. The curtains to the execution chamber closed at 6:29 p.m.\n\nAlabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said afterward that the gas flowed for about 18 minutes and that instruments indicated Frazier no longer had a heartbeat 13 minutes after the gas began.\n\nHamm said he believed that Frazier lost consciousness quickly. He said he believed other movements, including the raising of the legs and periodic breaths, were involuntary.\n\nA federal judge last week refused to block the execution. Defense attorneys had argued the new method does not work as quickly as the state promised. Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, previously described how those put to death with the method shook on the gurney at the start of their executions.\n\nThe judge, however, ruled that the descriptions of the executions did not support a finding that any of the men \u201cexperienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\u201d\n\nAbraham Bonowitz of Death Penalty Action said the method of execution is \u201cexperimental gas suffocation.\u201d He said it needs more scrutiny in the federal courts before Alabama uses it to carry out another execution.\n\nSome of Brown\u2019s family members witnessed the execution but declined to make a statement to the media.\n\nHours ahead of his execution, Frazier visited with his mother, sister and legal team. He had a final meal from Taco Bell that included burritos and a Mountain Dew soft drink.",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nInvestigators trying to determine what caused last week\u2019s deadly midair collision between a US military Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines plane near Washington, DC, briefed lawmakers Thursday on what they\u2019ve learned after combing through data from both aircraft and air traffic control.\n\nOfficials from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration spoke to the bipartisan Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Less than 5 miles away, crews kept searching the frigid waters of the Potomac River to remove pieces of wreckage from the January 29 disaster that killed 67 people near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nAfter the briefing, some senators discussed questions they posed to the NTSB, but did not reveal any new significant details from the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still evidence that has yet to be pulled from the water,\u201d Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, told reporters after the briefing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more yet to be learned. But it\u2019s clearly a thorough investigation by NTSB.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the Black Hawk helicopter has been recovered from the water.\n\nHomendy said the NTSB does not currently know whether the helicopter\u2019s ADS-B advanced surveillance technology was installed, as questions mount after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth gave conflicting comments after the briefing.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are avionics on that helicopter that we need to evaluate in order to determine what they did have and what was on at the time. More to come,\u201d Homendy told reporters.\n\nThe ADS\u2013B broadcasts information about an aircraft\u2019s location, altitude, ground speed and other data to aircraft and air traffic control, according to the FAA.\n\nNTSB chair Jennifer Homendy is seen during an NTSB briefing on Thursday. Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Republicans\n\nCruz said earlier after the briefing: \u201cThis was a training mission, so there was no compelling national security reason for ADS-B to be turned off.\u201d Duckworth, a former Black Hawk pilot, said it\u2019s not clear whether the technology was turned on but noted the \u201cArmy was clear it was installed in the aircraft.\u201d\n\nSearch teams are continuing to look for additional parts of the Black Hawk in the Potomac River, including the right engine and tail rotor, the NTSB said in an investigative update Thursday evening.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will be flying a \u201clight detection and ranging\u201d scan flight, or TopoBathy lidar, overnight to scan the river floor for debris, the NTSB said.\n\nWhile investigators search for clues, the FAA is reducing traffic into and out of Reagan National partly because of the recovery efforts, an FAA spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThursday\u2019s statement did not quantify the reduction. However, according to a source familiar with the FAA\u2019s plans, the airport\u2019s aircraft arrival rate is being reduced from 28 to 26 per hour, and average delays will increase from 40 minutes to 50 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe FAA is slowing traffic into and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to weather conditions and recovery efforts in the area,\u201d Thursday\u2019s statement from the FAA spokesperson reads. \u201cReal time updates are available at fly.faa.gov.\u201d\n\nTwo of Reagan National\u2019s runways \u2013 15-33 and 4-22 \u2013 are closed during the ongoing salvage operation, the airport said Wednesday morning. Flights are operating only on the airport\u2019s main runway, impacting airline schedules, according to the airport.\n\nFAA to look into other airports\n\nThe Black Hawk helicopter, which was stationed at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, was flying a training mission when it collided with the American Airlines plane in a busy stretch of airspace.\n\nThe FAA told CNN Thursday it has begun \u201creviewing other airports with high volumes of mixed helicopter and airplane traffic nearby.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s announcement came after some senators told reporters following Thursday\u2019s briefing they want to know which other airports across the country have high volumes of helicopter traffic in the same area as commercial jets.\n\n\u201cI asked the FAA today to conduct a review of helicopter routes not just at (Reagan National), but at other airports across the country to determine where there are risks of a similar such collision,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said.\n\nMoran described \u201ca lot of conversations about other airports across the country that have a lot of helicopter traffic and significant air traffic congestion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ought to be looking at seeing whether there are similar kinds of circumstances in other places where this congestion is prevalent,\u201d he said.\n\nConflicting data on the helicopter\u2019s altitude\n\nThe NTSB is grappling with conflicting altitude data as it tries to figure out how the collision unfolded.\n\nOne set of data comes from Potomac TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control). Potomac TRACON is a regional air traffic control facility that fuses information from radar sensors with the GPS data each aircraft broadcasts on its position.\n\nThe Potomac TRACON data for the Black Hawk showed the helicopter at about 300 feet shortly before the collision, the NTSB said Tuesday. The helicopter\u2019s designated route had a strict altitude limit of 200 feet, according to FAA charts.\n\nBut radar readings from the airport tower place the helicopter at 200 feet, while the flight data recorder for the commercial jet \u2013 which was approaching Reagan National Airport for a landing \u2013 reported the jet was at an altitude of 325 feet, NTSB member J. Todd Inman said over the weekend.\n\nDetermining the Black Hawk\u2019s precise altitude at the time of the collision is seen as a crucial step in understanding how two aircraft collided under clear skies over some of the country\u2019s most tightly controlled airspace.\n\nIn the meantime, the FAA has indefinitely suspended the use of most designated helicopter routes over the Potomac.\n\nBoth the aircrafts\u2019 flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2013 known as black boxes \u2013 have been recovered. Investigators have been working to synchronize the recordings to better understand the events leading to the collision.\n\nIn addition, separate teams are reviewing maintenance records for both aircraft.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of the information is critical to the investigation, and the NTSB is about transparency,\u201d Homendy told CNN on Monday.\n\nOfficials urged the public not to draw premature conclusions about the cause of the crash.\n\nThe NTSB is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash within 30 days. While final investigations often take more than a year to complete, Homendy voiced optimism that this case could progress more quickly.\n\n\u201cI would hope it would be much less than that,\u201d Homendy said.\n\nCrews led by the NTSB and the US Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving have pulled significant pieces of the passenger jet from the Potomac River, including its right wing, sections of the fuselage, the cockpit and key flight systems, according to the NTSB.\n\nWhat investigators are looking for in the wreckage\n\nThe wreckage is being sent to a secure location \u201cfor a full wreckage layout and examination,\u201d the NTSB said this week.\n\nThe investigation will include a detailed inspection of the jet\u2019s major components, structural damage and fracture surfaces as well as an assessment of its overall \u201cairworthiness,\u201d the NTSB said.\n\nInvestigators will also examine cockpit switch positions and instrument readings, the agency said.\n\nAll 67 killed have been identified\n\nAll 67 people killed in the collision have been recovered and identified, officials said Wednesday.\n\nAmong them was Ian Epstein, a charismatic American Airlines flight attendant who was remembered in a celebration of life In North Carolina Wednesday, CNN affiliate WBTV reported.\n\n\u201cHe was just the greatest guy who made everybody happy all the time,\u201d Lynne Southmayd, a former flight attendant, told WBTV.\n\nThose killed also included a civil rights attorney, the president-elect of the National Association of Biology Teachers and 28 members of the US Figure Skating community.\n\n\u201cWhat happened with this accident was tragic and catastrophic. 67 souls lost their (lives),\u201d Cruz said Thursday. \u201cWe need to learn lessons from the cause of that accident (and) do everything possible to prevent a subsequent accident.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Pete Muntean contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCalifornia utility company Southern California Edison on Thursday said its equipment \u201cmay be associated with\u201d the ignition of the Hurst Fire, which burned alongside the Eaton and Palisades fires during January\u2019s Los Angeles firestorms.\n\nThe admission came amid a required filing with the state\u2019s utility regulators.\n\nLast month, the company acknowledged fire agencies were investigating if its equipment may have started the Hurst Fire, which burned approximately 799 acres in Los Angeles County. The fire burned for eight days before being fully contained on January 16, but it did not destroy any structures or lead to any deaths, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.\n\n\u201cAbsent additional evidence, SCE believes its equipment may be associated with the ignition of the Hurst Fire,\u201d Thursday\u2019s filing said. SoCal Edison said it continues to cooperate with authorities as the cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n\nThe Los Angeles County\u2019s Coordinated Joint Information Center and the Los Angeles County Fire Department both declined to comment on the filing.\n\nCNN has also reached out to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass for comment on the company\u2019s admission.\n\nA second filing on Thursday addressed videos of the deadly Eaton Fire\u2019s early stages, suggesting a possible link to SoCal\u2019s equipment. The company said it is still working to determine potential causes of the ignition, including if its equipment could be related to the cause of the fire that destroyed over 9,000 structures.\n\n\u201cWe have seen information like videos shared by external parties of the fire\u2019s early stages. These are concerning and they may suggest a possible link to SCE\u2019s equipment. We are taking this very seriously,\u201d Pedro J. Pizarro, president and CEO of SoCal Edison\u2019s parent company, Edison International, said in a video message Thursday.\n\nThe company said it had not identified \u201ctypical or obvious indications\u201d that would support a link between the Eaton Fire and its transmission lines, citing a lack of \u201cbroken conductors, fresh arc marks in the preliminary origin area, or evidence of faults on the energized lines running through that area.\u201d\n\nThe Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 people and devastated Altadena, was fully contained last week. It burned over 14,000 acres, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCNN\u2019s Andy Rose contributed to this reporting.\n\nCorrection: A previous AP story misreported the utility company\u2019s statement about its equipment and the origin of the Hurst Fire. The utility said that its equipment may have sparked the fire.",

                "text": "The state agency that trains WA police officers is considering a ban on the Sig Sauer P320, after reports of shootings in which officers did not pull the trigger.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 A line of police recruits stood on the firing range at the Spokane Police Academy last October. Video shows a recruit from the Yakima Police Department drawing his handgun. Just as it leaves the holster, his Sig Sauer P320 handgun fired and the bullet narrowly missing the recruit standing next to him.\n\nThat incident sparked a statewide investigation into the P320 by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (WSCJTC), which trains and certifies all police officers in Washington.\n\nWhat alarmed experts is that the Yakima recruit says he never pulled the trigger on his P320. A firearms instructor standing next to him said the same thing, according to documents obtained by KING 5 through a public records request.\n\nInstructor Nick Minzghor wrote that he \u201clooked at [the recruit\u2019s] trigger finger and it was not on the trigger or in the trigger guard,\u201d according to the written report. The recruit\u2019s finger cannot be seen clearly on the range video.\n\nThe Spokane incident adds to the growing list of reports, mostly from law enforcement agencies, stating the Sig Sauer P320 can fire without anyone pulling the trigger. Several officers in other states have been seriously injured by \u201cuncommanded discharges\u201d of their P320s, with some of the shootings captured on body or dash camera video.\n\nSig Sauer denies claims as some police agencies ban the gun\n\nAs a work group compiles evidence after the Spokane incident, WSCJTC Executive Director Monica Alexander decided to \u201cpause\u201d the use of P320\u2019s at all the training commission\u2019s facilities in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to have a recruit get hurt,\u201d said Alexander. She says a decision on whether to permanently ban the weapon will be made soon, when the work group issues a fact-finding report to her.\n\nIn a conference call with the training commission work group, Sig Sauer defended the P320 and denied the gun can fire on its own.\n\n\u201cIt cannot happen. That sequence of components in there and the way that they are engineered does not allow this gun to just fire on its own,\u201d said Louis Graziano, a Sig Sauer rep and former New York City police officer.\n\nA version of Sig\u2019s P320 is the official handgun of all branches of the United Stated military. It\u2019s a common duty weapon issued by police departments nationwide, and tens of thousands of civilians own the gun.\n\nIn February of 2020, Cody Hoefs of Puyallup sued Sig Sauer, Inc., claiming his P320 \u201cdischarged with no prompting while fully-seated in its Sig brand holster.\u201d Hoefs's case was dismissed in 2023. His attorney, Brett Purtzer, said he and his client could not comment on the case because of a confidential settlement agreement with Sig Sauer.\n\nNone of the Washington State police departments identified in WSCJTC records that issue P320s were willing to speak with KING 5 about the impact of a ban on the gun. Bellevue Police Department has 190 P320s in service, Kitsap County Sheriff\u2019s Office has 229, and Burlington Police did not respond to questions.\n\nThe Pierce County Sheriff\u2019s Office barred its officers from using the P320 when the Washington Post reported on the issue in 2023.\n\nVancouver police, which reported four P320 incidents to the WSCJTC work group, did not respond to messages.\n\n'A serious problem with this gun'\n\nNo officers have been injured in Washington. But elsewhere, some of the cases have been devastating.\n\n\u201cI lost my career, my marriage. Still to date it still affects me, mentally, physically\u2026everything,\u201d said former Loudon County, Virginia sheriff\u2019s deputy Marcie Vadnais. Her law enforcement career ended in 2018 as she sat in her patrol car removing P320, seated in a Sig Sauer holster, from her duty belt.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m [removing it], it shot me straight in the femur,\u201d said Vadnais. \u201cI should not have to worry about, if I manipulate a weapon inside a holster, fully seated in a holster, that it\u2019s going to shoot me in the thigh,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious problem with this gun. It should not be on store shelves to this date. Somebody is going to lose their life.\"\n\nHer attorney, Jeff Bagnell of Connecticut, said he\u2019s filed about two dozen lawsuits against Sig Sauer, some of them resulting in confidential settlements, as in Vadnais\u2019s case.\n\nHe says the P320 suffers from design and manufacturing flaws. He estimates there have been 200 known incidents of uncommanded discharges, many involving highly-trained law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been calling for this gun to be recalled for at least eight years now,\u201d said Bagnell.\n\nHowever, any recall by Sig would be voluntary because federal law shields gun manufacturers from mandatory recalls.\n\nBagnell said one party that should be concerned about the Sig\u2019s alleged shortcomings should be the police departments that issue the firearms. He says some lawsuits have targeted those departments \u201cbecause they had knowledge of the problem and yet they still put it into the hands of their police officers.\u201d\n\nIf the Criminal Justice Training Commission\u2019s permanently bans the P320, that would only apply to its facilities. However, such a decision would also increase the liability for Washington law enforcement agencies that continue to use the gun.",

Denver Health says it's complying with the order to maintain access to federal programs, but families across the state are grappling with the impact.\n\nOne Boulder family, fearful for their safety, spoke anonymously about their struggles.\n\n\"We're terrified. I can't get her out of the country and I can't get her care,\" said a Boulder father, identified only as Manny. \"It seems like a death sentence to me.\"\n\nManny's 16-year-old daughter, who's transgender, has received gender-affirming care for years. But that will end this month due to the federal order.\n\n\"We have enough time to maybe get one more shot,\" he said.\n\nWith local hospitals no longer providing treatment and their insurance no longer covering it, the family is looking for alternatives.\n\n\"The out-of-pocket cost is over $200,000, which we're willing to do,\" Manny said. \"We'll take on the debt. I have doctors that verify with writing that these are all treatments that we need to keep her alive and I can't do anything.\"\n\nManny, a Boulder County father who didn't want his last name being used, shows medical records to CBS News Colorado reporter Sarah Horbacewicz for his daughter, who's transgender. CBS\n\nFacing limited options, Manny and his family bought plane tickets to leave the country in search of political asylum.\n\n\"I don't care if it's a third-world country. Let me sleep in a box and keep my daughter safe,\" he said.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump took office, they applied for passports. But his daughter's never arrived. Instead, the U.S. Department of State sent a letter asking if they wanted to confirm \"female\" as the gender marker. Manny said yes, but then he said the application \"got locked up.\"\n\nThe family then attempted to change the passport gender marker to male to comply with the new classification required under Mr. Trump's order, but the passport remains stuck in the system.\n\n\"Constitutionally, as an American citizen, she's allowed to have one,\" Manny said. \"And there's no resources right now for us to be able to pursue any line forward, a. to get her to safety without a passport, or b. to provide her care.\"\n\nTheir flight is booked for Monday, but Manny doesn't know if they'll be able to board.\n\n\"Being the parent, I hurt seeing her hurt,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"But I can't imagine how she really hurts.\"\n\nManny, a Boulder County father, chokes up while describing the struggle he's experiencing seeking health care for his daughter who's transgender, or a passport to seek political asylum in another country. CBS\n\nU.S. Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse's office says it has received multiple similar requests for assistance. After being contacted about Manny's case, Neguse, whose district includes Boulder, said his working to help the family.\n\nOn Mr. Trump's first day back in office, he issued a sweeping order stating that the government would only recognize two sexes: male and female. The U.S. State Department subsequently stopped granting requests for new or updated passports with gender markers that do not conform to that definition.\n\nMr. Trump says the orders are meant to protect women.\n\n\"Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety and well-being,\" he said in a statement.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump also signed an order aimed at cutting federal support for gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. The order restricts access to puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures. It also bars some insurance companies from covering such treatments, prompting hospitals nationwide to pause gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nA group of transgender minors and their families have filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, arguing the executive action discriminates based on sex and transgender status.",

She ultimately felt unsafe returning to work, leading to her alleged constructive discharge.\n\nOn Friday evening, Mayor Jarom Wagoner expressed his support for Chief Ingram.\n\n\u201c Chief Ingram, like any public official, is entitled to a fair and impartial review of the allegations. We urge the public to allow the judicial system to work through this process and avoid drawing conclusions before all facts are presented,\u201d says Mayor Wagonar\n\nWe reached out to Butler's attorney, who says they aren't in a position to comment at this time other than what's provided in the suit.\n\nWe tried to reach out to Ingram but were unsuccessful.\n\nMayor Wagoner says he wants to ensure justice and trust in how city law enforcement operates.\n\nHe says, \"The ultimate goal for me, the city, the city council, and the police chief is to ensure justice, protect public trust, and maintain the strong foundation upon which our city's law enforcement operates.\u201d\n\n",

The teens were ages 14,15 and 17. None of the teens were vaccinated, and only one of them had underlying conditions.\n\n\"The flu can be quite serious, and it can affect teens even without underlying conditions,\" says Dr. William Tseng, assistant chief of staff at Kaiser Permanente.\n\nEven though we're in the middle of flu season already, Dr. Tseng says it's not too late to get the vaccine. According to county numbers, nearly 80% of people ages 5 to 17 haven't received their flu shot.\n\nAs Aminah's family continues to grieve, they hope her story will convince even just one family to go get vaccinated.\n\nHer family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with expenses for her celebration of life.

CNN has reached out to the National Security Council for clarification.\n\nTrump said in the interview he \u201cbetter not say\u201d how many times he had spoken with Putin but touted a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with his Russian counterpart.\n\nThe US president expressed hope that Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, which is approaching its third anniversary, ends \u201cfast.\u201d He had previously vowed to end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s fast. Every day people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing,\u201d he told the New York Post.\n\nTrump said earlier this week that talks to end the war had \u201cmade a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, which took place as Trump traveled aboard Air Force One to Florida on Friday, the president directed his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, to \u201cget these meetings going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to meet. Every day people are dying. Young handsome soldiers are being killed. Young men, like my sons. On both sides. All over the battlefield,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Friday, the president told reporters that he would \u201cprobably\u201d meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this upcoming week and hinted that he planned to also talk with Putin.\n\n\u201cI will probably be meeting with President Zelensky next week, and I will probably be talking to President Putin,\u201d Trump said.\n\nZelensky is expected to lead Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the Munich Security Conference, which Vice President JD Vance and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg are also scheduled to attend, but not Trump.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump said that he wants to secure access to Ukraine\u2019s supply of rare earth minerals in exchange for continued US assistance to the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to do a deal with Ukraine, where they\u2019re going to secure what we\u2019re giving them with their rare earths and other things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, complaining that Europe had not provided Ukraine the same level of aid as the US.\n\nThe transactional proposal offers some insight into Trump\u2019s intentions when it comes to the Ukraine war. He has long complained about the US burden in arming Kyiv, but hasn\u2019t detailed his plans for halting or continuing support since taking office.\n\nThe Kremlin told CNN earlier this week there have been no serious discussions about a possible meeting between Trump and Putin.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t had any initial contact to discuss whether they need to meet or not and if they need, when and how,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN\u2019s Matthew Chance.\n\nAmid growing anticipation of contact between the two leaders, a senior Russian lawmaker told state media that that \u201cadvanced\u201d preparations were underway for a meeting, possibly as early as this month.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe United States Secret Service has tapped blockbuster movie director Michael Bay to create a recruiting advertisement that is expected to be unveiled in the stadium on Super Bowl Sunday, according to multiple NFL and Secret Service sources.\n\nThe ad cost an estimated $2 million for the Secret Service to produce, according to two sources familiar with the project \u2014 a hefty price tag that comes amid massive budget cuts and layoffs at other government agencies.\n\nOne source told CNN the estimated $2 million budget is about double what was spent on previous Secret Service recruiting ads.\n\nThe ad is expected to air during the pregame show on a jumbotron inside New Orleans\u2019 Superdome stadium, according to a source close to the NFL. The ad time is being donated, so the Secret Service will not have to pay an additional fee. Ad buys during Super Bowl Sunday typically cost millions of dollars, with a 30-second ad airing on television costing up to $8 million this year.\n\nThe ad\u2019s purpose of recruitment comes at a crucial time, as the Secret Service has been wracked with low morale, burnout, staffing and retention issues. The thrust of the ad showcases the Secret Service\u2019s role in protecting the nation\u2019s leaders and points out the very game the audience is attending is secured by the agency, according to sources familiar with the ad.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Secret Service Director Sean Curran told CNN that he \u201cempowered the team to identify a novel and expedient approach that leveraged one of the most recognizable Directors to produce a representation of the men and women behind the Secret Service within nine days while ensuring compliance with requisite rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Director, my focus will always be to lean forward to meet the needs of our workforce,\u201d Curran said through the spokesperson.\n\nNews of the ad comes days after Bay \u2014 the Hollywood action director behind the \u201cTransformers\u201d movies and \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 was seen in White House pool footage shaking hands with Donald Trump as the president boarded Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews last week. Sources familiar with the project say Bay was shooting the recruiting ad on-site.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the ad, it includes images of Secret Service agents as well as former presidents, including possible historic footage of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. There is also expected to be an image of Trump from the day of last year\u2019s assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. However, it is not clear what will make the final edit.\n\n\u201cI came up with the concept for the PSA that America was founded on the idea of freedom,\u201d Bay told CNN in a statement. \u201cThroughout our short but powerful history as Americans, we have always stepped forward in time of need. This was a spot to honor the true silent heroes who protect the leaders of our democracy.\u201d\n\nTrump will be at the game, and possibly on site when the ad airs in the stadium. Earlier this week, a White House official told CNN the president is expected to attend the game, which would make him the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl.\n\nThe Secret Service ad airing on Super Bowl Sunday comes after days of back-and-forth negotiations between the agency, Bay and the NFL.\n\nCNN first learned last week that the ad would air on a jumbotron inside the stadium during the game. But by Friday afternoon \u2014 just two days before the game \u2014 a source close to the league told CNN the ad would not be airing. The source said the Secret Service submitted its request too late and programming on the jumbotron had already been locked.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, CNN learned the NFL had found space to air the ad during the pregame. The NFL declined to comment.\n\nThere were also conversations regarding a possible televised commercial on Fox, two sources said, adding that the ad space would have been donated to the Secret Service.\n\nThe Secret Service will own the ad for five years and plans to use it on social media to drive future recruitment for years to come.\n\nThe spot came together in less than two weeks \u2014 a rapid timeline for a busy Hollywood hitter like Bay and typically slow-moving government agencies \u2014 indicating the importance of the ad to the Secret Service.\n\nCNN has filed Freedom of Information Act records requests to determine the actual cost and budget for the ad campaign.\n\nThe security footprint at the game will be both massive and tight. Multiple high-profile leaders beyond Trump will be there, and the city of New Orleans is still reeling from the New Year\u2019s terrorist attack that killed 14 people.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA federal judge, citing a risk of \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d has temporarily restricted Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency team from accessing a critical Treasury Department payment system.\n\nThe judge\u2019s order, issued early Saturday, temporarily halts access to a sensitive payment system that distributes Americans\u2019 tax returns, Social Security benefits, disability payments and federal employees\u2019 salaries.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Engelmayer ordered the destruction of any downloaded information from the payment system by anyone given access to it since January 20, citing \u201cthe risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.\u201d\n\nA hearing on the matter was set for February 14.\n\nThe White House called Saturday\u2019s order \u201cjudicial overreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrandstanding government efficiency speaks volumes about those who\u2019d rather delay much-needed change with legal shenanigans than work with the Trump Administration of ridding the government of waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CNN in a statement.\n\nEngelmayer\u2019s ruling was in response to a suit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and 18 other state attorneys general against the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and Musk have upended the federal workforce in their quest to shrink the government, sparking chaos, fear, anger \u2014 and multiple lawsuits that have prompted judicial action.\n\nMusk also offered a defense of the access in a social media post Saturday, saying that DOGE and the Treasury Department \u201cjointly agreed\u201d to requirements involving government payments, including that \u201call outgoing government payments have a payment categorization code, which is necessary in order to pass financial audits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe above super obvious and necessary changes are being implemented by existing, long-time career government employees, not anyone from @DOGE. It is ridiculous that these changes didn\u2019t exist already!\u201d Musk added.\n\nSaturday\u2019s order came on the heels of another court ruling temporarily blocking the administration\u2019s attempts to dismantle the US Agency for International Development.\n\nAnd a federal judge paused a Thursday deadline for the administration\u2019s so-called buyout offer to federal employees while more proceedings on the program\u2019s legality played out. That followed earlier federal court rulings halting a sweeping federal spending freeze.\n\nThe suit from the attorneys general alleges the team led by Musk and staffed by young associates categorized as \u201cspecial government employees\u201d have been unlawfully granted access to the Treasury system that previously was restricted to specific government employees.\n\nThe effort by what the Trump administration calls the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is intended to cut government costs drastically but has sought access to critical computer systems, including the Treasury payment system, at the objection of others in the agencies, as CNN previously reported.\n\nDOGE\u2019s actions have ignited a tense political debate and emergency court proceedings over its access to the system and the administration\u2019s potential interest in using it to turn off payments as it chooses.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of Doge members presents a unique security risk to the States and State residents whose data is held,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nThe payment system offers services for more than 250 federal agencies and is the conduit for an extraordinary swath of critical individual payments. It is central to the operations of the US government and the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nThe administration\u2019s efforts have drawn the wrath of Democratic senators as well as unions and protestors concerned about Musk\u2019s incursion into the private data of US citizens.\n\nMusk and his DOGE team have sought to disrupt or gain access to a number of government nerve centers, including those responsible for the federal workforce, real estate portfolio, computer systems and records management.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s first moves to upend the federal government were felt most acutely at USAID, after the president placed a freeze on most foreign aid.\n\nIn the separate court decision late Friday involving USAID, another federal judge ordered the Trump administration to halt its plans to put at least 2,200 employees at the agency on administrative leave and required the temporary reinstatement of 500 other workers who had been suspended.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWe will not know the extent or the success of President Donald Trump\u2019s purge of the federal bureaucracy for some time. There will be lawsuits to fight some of his firings and delay or derail his effort to shut down departments and agencies.\n\nBut it is safe to assume the government that emerges at the end of his last four years in office will be permanently different than the one he inherited. Trump wants the federal government to be more immediately responsive to his political aims, and there have been comparisons to the spoils system put in place by his presidential hero, Andrew Jackson.\n\nIt\u2019s an imperfect comparison, as I learned from Daniel Feller, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Tennessee, who has written extensively about Jackson and the spoils system of the 19th century. Trump\u2019s purge of the federal government could go even deeper.\n\nOur conversation, edited for clarity, is below. It includes the story of a man named Samuel Swartwout, who swindled the US out of tariff revenue right under his Army buddy President Jackson\u2019s nose.\n\nWhat is the spoils system?\n\nWOLF: You\u2019ve written extensively about the spoils system. How would you describe it to Americans today?\n\nFELLER: It is a system by which government offices are filled by people whose major qualification is their political service to the president\u2019s party.\n\nHow did the spoils system come to be?\n\nWOLF: How did it kind of come about during the Jacksonian era?\n\nFELLER: The rise of the spoils system during and after Jackson\u2019s presidency \u2013 it wasn\u2019t all Jackson\u2019s doing \u2013 was attendant upon the rise of political partisanship in the United States.\n\nIn the years before Jackson, when party conflict had been muted and confused and even, at times, virtually invisible, then there was no reason, no motive, to appoint federal officers on the basis of partisan affiliation.\n\nWhat makes this partly complicated is the image that we have today of Jackson getting into office and firing everybody and then replacing them with party hacks. That is partly true. It\u2019s not a false image, but it\u2019s not as simple as that.\n\nJackson did not overtly intend to create a spoils system as so called. What he thought he was doing was cleaning out the federal bureaucracy from people who would become lazy and arrogant and incompetent, and replacing them with better ones.\n\nBut it is true that service, not to him personally, but to what Jackson called the \u201ccause of the people,\u201d was one of the qualifications. This certainly provided an opening for people whose main qualification was party service to put themselves in line for jobs. And then the whole thing became institutionalized after Jackson.\n\nIt became routine that people like postmasters and customs officers were going to be cleaned out when there was a transfer of administration.\n\nPortrait of US president Andrew Jackson. Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nRegarding Samuel Swartwout\u2026\n\nWOLF: Was there a particular spoils system appointee who was particularly bad?\n\nFELLER: There were some really bad ones. Jackson\u2019s worst appointment all around was a man named Samuel Swartwout. I\u2019m not actually sure how you pronounce it. Swartwout had been an old Army buddy of Jackson\u2019s.\n\nJackson had an incredible sense of loyalty to people who had served with him in the military, and along with that, he could not believe that anyone who had served bravely in combat and shed their blood in their country\u2019s cause could be anything other than scrupulously honest and efficient in civil office.\n\nIn 1829, shortly after he was elected, Jackson appointed Swartwout to be customs collector for the Port of New York.\n\nThe United States at that time got about 90% of its revenue from tariffs on imported goods.\n\nMore than half of that was collected at New York City. So the customs collector of the Port of New York had more than half of the federal government\u2019s revenue passing through his hands. As was discovered afterwards, a lot of it wound up sticking to Swartwout\u2019s hands.\n\nThe funny thing about this is Jackson did not say, \u201cI\u2019m appointing Swartwout because he\u2019s a political supporter of mine,\u201d though he was.\n\nJackson\u2019s new secretary of state was Martin Van Buren, who was from New York state. And Van Buren knew the players in New York very well and actually wrote Jackson and said, \u201cDo not do this.\u201d I\u2019m almost quoting, \u201cI was never surer of anything in my life than that you\u2019re going to be sorry about this.\u201d Van Buren actually orchestrated a letter writing campaign against Swartwout from all of his prominent political friends in New York state, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t appoint this guy.\u201d\n\nJackson, astonishingly, wrote Van Buren back, and he said, \u201cWell, it may be true that Mr. Swartwout is not wealthy, but an honest man is the noblest work of God.\u201d\n\nVan Buren hadn\u2019t been saying that Swartwout was poor but honest. He was saying he was rich and dishonest, and Jackson just didn\u2019t get it at all.\n\nSwartwout remained as customs collector the Port of New York for all of Jackson\u2019s term as president. When you left the federal government office, then all of your accounts had to be audited, and you had to reconcile your accounts. Swartwout\u2019s accounts came up short more than $1 million, which at that time was an astonishingly large sum of money. Swartwout decided it would be time to take a long, long trip to Europe.\n\nWhat are the echoes today?\n\nWOLF: It\u2019s impossible to directly apply news events today to what happened with a completely different federal bureaucracy in the 1820s and 30s, but as you read the news, what kinds of echoes and differences do you see?\n\nFELLER: Well, there certainly are echoes. There certainly are some surface level similarities. And we can\u2019t resist noticing those.\n\nI think Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s just like Andrew Jackson, and I can point out some rather startling ways \u2013 and really historically brazenly obvious ones \u2013 in which he\u2019s not.\n\nBut there is this similarity that both Trump and Jackson came into office thinking of themselves as outsiders to the ongoing government establishment and thinking that establishment was hostile to them and likely to be hostile to their policy initiatives. There\u2019s a certain amount, not only of overthrow of personnel, but of personal grievance, resentment, behind it.\n\nTrump himself used the word retribution a whole lot. Jackson did not use the word retribution, but he was certainly seeking retribution. There were not only people he wanted to put in place. They were, more particularly, people he wanted to fire. So there is that similarity.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House, on Monday, January 20, in Washington. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nHow is what Trump\u2019s doing different than the spoils system?\n\nWOLF: I\u2019m interested in the differences, because I do think that Trump sees himself as this kind of Jacksonian figure, to the extent that he thinks about it.\n\nFELLER: Trump\u2019s overhaul of the patronage is much more policy driven, or much more policy-grievance driven than Jackson\u2019s was.\n\nWhen Jackson replaced customs officers, for instance, and when he replaced a whole bunch of district attorneys, he was not signaling any kind of policy differentiation here. He wasn\u2019t doing this in order that the customs be collected differently.\n\nWhat Jackson complained about, about the people he removed, was that they\u2019d become arrogant through long tenure \u2013 they had become indifferent to the needs of the public that they were serving. They had become lazy, and they had used their official position to oppose his campaign, to oppose the voice of the people. You could find some similarities between that and Trump, but Jackson\u2019s response to all this is to put in customs officers who will just go ahead and collect the customs, which is what the previous officers had been doing. With the district attorneys it was the same thing. There wasn\u2019t any idea that by replacing the district attorneys, we\u2019re going to stop prosecuting one whole category of people and start prosecuting another.\n\nSo in a way, Trump\u2019s attack on the bureaucracy is much, much deeper. It\u2019s not just a matter of personalities. It\u2019s a matter of \u2013 I don\u2019t know if the right word is overall ideology or something else \u2013 but it\u2019s an attempt not only to switch some people out and to improve efficiency, but to entirely restructure and in some cases overtly destroy aspects of the federal government.\n\nThe other big news the last few days has been the tariffs, and Trump, back during his first term, actually, gave speeches in which he said, I\u2019m just like Andrew Jackson and Andrew Jackson imposed tariffs to protect American workers.\n\nIt\u2019s the exact opposite of the truth. The literal, exact opposite of the truth.\n\nJackson\u2019s view of tariffs\n\nWOLF: What happened with Jackson\u2019s tariffs?\n\nFELLER: A big issue when Jackson was elected president was the so-called protective tariff, which was providing most of the federal government\u2019s revenue. But it also, Southern plantation owners claimed, was skewed so that they had to pay for it in the form of higher prices for imported consumer goods and people who were benefiting from it were northern manufacturers.\n\nHe entered office as a very equivocal defender of the protective tariff. He dropped that within two years and instead took the position that the tariff should be reduced to the minimal level necessary to meet the federal government\u2019s basic expenses and no more. And throughout his term, he never advocated increasing a tariff on anything.\n\nWhat he did advocate more and more forcefully was reducing the tariff and bringing it down to what he called a revenue standard.\n\n\u2018It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.\u2019\n\nWOLF: I think we can assume that Trump will have a standoff with the Federal Reserve in the near future over interest rates. He has also announced there would be this new United States sovereign wealth fund to take ownership stakes in things like TikTok. This may be another imperfect application of history, but Jackson also fought the Bank of the US. Do you see any kind of, historical notes for what is to come in terms of the Fed or American money?\n\nFELLER: We\u2019re in such a different environment today. Let\u2019s say Trump attacks the Federal Reserve \u2013 having attacked the Federal Reserve during his first term also, and there was some talk then about, \u201cOh, this is just like Andrew Jackson.\u201d\n\nI see no similarity whatsoever.\n\nI wrote a piece published by The Conversation, with the title \u201cWarning of \u2018oligarchy,\u2019 Biden channels Andrew Jackson.\u201d\n\nThe point of that piece was that if you look at Jackson\u2019s banking policy \u2013 in particular his veto of the Bank of the United States in 1832 and then his farewell address \u2013 the main thrust of that was Jackson\u2019s feeling that a concentration of wealth, power and influence threatened American democracy; it threatened the political voice of ordinary people; and it threatened Americans\u2019 well-being. Jackson found that locus of concentrated wealth, power and influence in the Bank of the United States, and he had reasons for doing so.\n\n(Former President Joe) Biden found it in what he called an oligarchy \u2013 he also called it the tech industrial complex. I like as a historian not to be a partisan, because I think it undercuts my authority as a historian, but it\u2019s hard not to see the echo of Biden\u2019s attack on the technocracy in the fact that Elon Musk in large part seems to be running the country now. Musk is a tech mogul; he\u2019s not a banker.\n\nThe Bank of the United States is nothing like the Federal Reserve although it did indeed have a lot of powers of the Federal Reserve and had a lot of the powers of today\u2019s United States Treasury. It was a private bank. It had stockholders. It paid dividends, it made profits, and the people who were running the bank were the stockholders of the bank. This is not like the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is not out to make money for itself. That\u2019s not its job.\n\nWOLF: Sounds a little more like a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nFELLER: Well said. He laid this all out in the bank veto. As Jackson said in that veto, the most famous line in it, \u201cIt is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.\u201d That\u2019s his objection to the Bank of the United States. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s making that objection to the Federal Reserve.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk is not interested in buying video-sharing platform TikTok, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX said during a virtual meeting at the WELT Economic Summit on January 28.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not put in a bid for TikTok and I don\u2019t have any plans for what would I do if I had TikTok,\u201d Musk said in a video released online Saturday by The WELT Group, which is owned by German media company Axel Springer.\n\nThe Chinese-owned app, which has about 170 million monthly American users, was set to be banned on January 20 due to national security concerns. President Donald Trump gave ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, a last-minute lifeline by delaying the ban for 75 days. The extension has given TikTok more time to find a non-Chinese buyer, a condition in the bill signed by former President Joe Biden last April.\n\nByteDance has said it doesn\u2019t have plans to sell, though some investors have publicly stated they are interested.\n\nYouTube and TikTok influencer MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, posted in January that he intended to buy the app. \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt are also among a group of billionaires who have expressed interest.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest man, was thought to be a potential bidder.\n\nIn 2022, Musk completed a $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter, which he has since renamed X. But Musk says he\u2019s not one to acquire companies, calling it \u201chighly unusual.\u201d\n\nHe said that acquiring Twitter was because it was \u201cimportant to preserve freedom of speech in America,\u201d and that he\u2019s not sure \u201cif the same logic applies to TikTok.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t acquire things just for economic reasons. It\u2019s not clear to me what the purpose of acquiring TikTok would be apart from economics,\u201d he added.\n\nTikTok\u2019s US assets, without the algorithm, are estimated to be worth between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\nBut much of the app\u2019s value may lie in the algorithm, making it difficult to put a dollar figure on it. The first step for any buyer, as Musk acknowledged, would be to look at TikTok\u2019s algorithm, which impacts users\u2019 experience.\n\nMusk said that if he were to look at the algorithm, he would decide \u201chow harmful or useful is this algorithm.\u201d\n\nTesla and SpaceX did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.",

                "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nSonos was once a pioneer in wireless home audio, holding its own against giants like Apple and Google in the niche market of premium speaker equipment. But after nearly a year of missteps and disappointment, the company says it has a plan to turn around its misfortunes \u2013 and regain customer trust.\n\nThe audio company has been in turmoil after a dysfunctional app update last May caused customer outrage, overshadowing the launch of its first-ever headphones. The app meltdown cost the company $100 million, the CFO estimated late last year. Share prices slid (SONO).\n\nChief executive Patrick Spence stepped down in January, and on February 5, Sonos laid off 200 employees, or 12% of its workforce, adding to the company\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cAs a longtime passionate customer myself, I know the magic of Sonos, but I also know the extreme disappointment of the company\u2019s recent app challenges,\u201d interim CEO Tom Conrad said on the company\u2019s earnings call on February 6.\n\nThe company is reshuffling its product-focused teams into groups organized around topics like hardware, software, quality, design and operations, rather than individual product categories, Conrad said on that call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s salvageable, but they\u2019ve got to act quick,\u201d said Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies who covers Sonos. \u201cThey have great products. It\u2019s just I think they\u2019ve lost some of the consumer thrust and excitement, and they\u2019ve got to get back quick to regain this.\u201d\n\nSonos Ace headphones during a media preview in New York, on May 15, 2024. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe app debacle\n\nSonos\u2019 missteps with its May app update have turned the company on its head. The software update, which aimed to overhaul and improve the app experience, removed simple user features and introduced glitches like not being able to control speaker volume or set alarms.\n\nUsers flocked to social media and Reddit forums to complain about the company\u2019s app. Yet Sonos failed to act swiftly and offered inadequate fixes, according to Jefferies\u2019 Thill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a company take so long to make an update,\u201d Thill said. \u201cAnd I think they lost kind of critical time. They obviously had a lot of upset consumers and rightfully so.\u201d\n\nThe fallout from the app debacle hit Sonos\u2019 bottom line.\n\n\u201cWe estimate the challenges associated with our app launch adversely affected our revenue by at least $100 million,\u201d CFO Saori Casey said on the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call in November.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual revenue declined more than 8% from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, according to SEC filings, sliding from $1.66 billion to $1.52 billion. (The company\u2019s fiscal year ends in September.)\n\n\u201cIf you have good hardware, which they do, but you have crappy software, it\u2019s a toxic mix,\u201d Thill said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to use your hardware.\u201d\n\nFrom \u2018darling\u2019 to \u2018dropout\u2019\n\nSonos made a splash in consumer tech in the 2000s because it was a trailblazer in the field of wireless speakers, according to Saikat Chaudhuri, a professor at Berkeley Haas School of Business.\n\nBorn out of Silicon Valley, the company aimed to remake peoples\u2019 experience with audio in their homes. Sonos launched its first product, an audio player that powers speakers, in January 2005.\n\n\u201cThey were an innovative company, came up with a cool set of products, and it was really something novel,\u201d Chaudhuri said.\n\nSonos was the \u201ccustomer experience darling\u201d of tech companies in the 2000s, according to Larry Vincent, a professor at USC Marshall School of Business. From the packaging to the sleek hardware, Sonos\u2019 products developed a dedicated customer base.\n\nYet since Sonos\u2019 first product launch, the \u201clandscape has changed\u201d for home audio options, Berkeley\u2019s Chaudhuri said, as giants like Google and Amazon have moved into home devices, longtime competitors like Bose have diversified their products and new innovative companies have emerged.\n\nAdditionally, Chaudhuri said Sonos did not take advantage of the emergence of streaming services and the opportunity to become a more dynamic company beyond hardware offerings.\n\nSonos faces fresh competition from younger audio companies such as Turtlebox and BluOS, putting more pressure on the company to deliver, according to Jefferies\u2019 Thill.\n\nSonos' Digital Music System is on display in this photo taken Wednesday, February 23, 2005, in Los Angeles. Damian Dovarganes/AP\n\nIn recent years, Sonos also began to lose touch with its customer experience. The app rollout was the final straw, Vincent said, and a clear lesson in the importance of prioritizing customer experience while growing as a company.\n\n\u201cThey went from customer experience darling to a customer experience dropout,\u201d he said.\n\nThe redemption arc\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake for Sonos in 2025. The company posted back-to-back net losses in fiscal year 2023 and 2024, according to SEC filings, and its stock is down almost 22% year-over-year.\n\nInterim CEO Conrad said on Sonos\u2019 February 6 earnings call that his focus is \u201cgetting Sonos back on track.\u201d Conrad said he is focusing on three areas: \u201cperformance and reliability, usability and design and new experiences\u201d to \u201creturn to excellence in the core experience.\u201d\n\nNow, the company will have to prove it can deliver on that pledge.\n\nUSC Marshall\u2019s Vincent said that he thinks it is imperative that Sonos focuses on fixing its customer experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they are able to turn it around,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cBecause brands like this don\u2019t come around all the time.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThree former athletes at the University of Pennsylvania women\u2019s swimming program sued the school, the Ivy League Council of Presidents and athletics organizations Tuesday, claiming they violated federal law to allow transgender athlete Lia Thomas to compete against them.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid a flurry of efforts attempting to keep transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports, including legal moves in all three branches of the federal government such as President Donald Trump signing an executive order to that effect.\n\nThe complaint filed by Grace Estabrook, Ellen Holmquist and Margot Kaczorowski focuses on the 2022 Ivy League women\u2019s championships, where Thomas won four first-place medals and set multiple records, demanding that her records be vacated.\n\n\u201cThe Ivy League engaged in a season-long pressure campaign to keep Thomas eligible to compete and prevent women from speaking up for their equal rights,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn addition to UPenn and the Ivy League, the lawsuit names the NCAA and Harvard University, which hosted the 2022 league championship event, accusing them of violating Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal funding. Thomas is not a defendant in the suit.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by attorney Bill Bock, a former NCAA Infractions Committee member who also filed suit last year on behalf of other collegiate swimmers in connection with Thomas\u2019 participation in the 2022 NCAA championships.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit exposes the behind the scenes scheming that led to the attempt by Harvard University, UPenn, the Ivy League and the NCAA, to impose radical gender ideology on the American college sports landscape,\u201d Bock said in a statement to CNN.\n\n\u201cCollege sports are the premier stage for women\u2019s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women\u2019s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe NCAA also announced Thursday an overhaul of its transgender athlete policy to limit participation in women\u2019s sports, which the organization said it was in response to Trump\u2019s executive order.\n\n\u201cA student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women\u2019s team,\u201d the new policy states. It also prohibits transgender male athletes who receive testosterone treatment from competing on a women\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThis national standard brings much needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today\u2019s student-athletes,\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Harvard said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on active litigation.\u201d CNN did not immediately receive a response Thursday to requests for comment from the other defendants. No hearings have yet been scheduled in the case.\n\nLeague accused of favoritism toward Thomas\n\nThe plaintiffs say they were discouraged from expressing disagreement with the university\u2019s stand to accommodate Thomas, who had previously competed on the UPenn men\u2019s swimming team, including Thomas\u2019 presence in women\u2019s locker rooms.\n\nA swim coach allegedly had told Kaczorowski that Thomas would not be using the same locker room when Thomas joined the women\u2019s team, but that changed in the fall of 2021. That coach told Kaczorowski \u201cthere was nothing he could do\u201d about it, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cHarvard did not provide a unisex bathroom or separate bathroom for Thomas to use or for any other women to use who did not want to use the Women\u2019s Locker room while Thomas was using it\u201d during the Ivy League Championships, the complaint states.\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris of fighting against tighter NCAA rules on transgender participation in swimming, which the NCAA was considering and would have made Thomas ineligible to compete in 2022. Harris did not respond to a CNN request for comment Thursday.\n\nUnder NCAA guidelines adopted in 2010, athletes assigned male at birth could participate in women\u2019s sports as long as they had been using testosterone suppression medication for at least a year, a standard that has been heavily scrutinized as to whether it potentially gives recently transitioned athletes an unfair physical advantage.\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA adopted new sport-specific standards requiring testing for most transgender athletes to assure their testosterone levels are below a defined level. The rules for swimming, announced less than a month before the 2022 women\u2019s championships, would have made it impossible for Thomas to participate because it required three years of documented hormone levels, dating back to before her transition.\n\nThe association ultimately delayed implementation of the new standard until after the 2022 championship events, saying the short window for compliance \u201ccould have unfair and potentially detrimental impacts on schools and student-athletes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ivy League had won when the NCAA backed down and changed its nationwide rules to bring Thomas back into compliance and renew Thomas\u2019 eligibility,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nPlaintiff Ellen Holmquist did not qualify for the Ivy League Championships that year. Holmquist claims she was told by a coach that she had missed the cutoff by one spot, arguing that Thomas\u2019 participation effectively denied her the opportunity to compete.\n\nTransgender athletes facing backlash\n\nRepublicans now in control of the White House and both houses of Congress have quickly implemented their promised rollback of transgender participation in sports. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday cutting federal funding to educational programs in institutions that allow transgender athletes in women\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cWith this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs the \u201cNo Men in Women\u2019s Sports\u201d executive order Wednesday at the White House. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nThe House passed a similar bill last month. It has not yet been considered by the Senate.\n\nThe order was criticized by Athlete Ally, which advocates for transgender athletes, saying, \u201cOur hearts break for the trans youth who will no longer be able to know the joy of playing sports as their full and authentic selves.\u201d\n\nLast year, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, which organizes sports at 250 smaller colleges and universities, announced it was effectively banning athletic participation by transgender women in most of its women\u2019s sports programs.\n\n\u201cOnly NAIA student-athletes whose biological sex is female may participate in NAIA-sponsored female sports,\u201d the association said, providing exceptions only for practices, team activities and exhibitions.\n\nThe latest legal moves are causing whiplash within collegiate compliance departments after the Biden administration previously introduced regulations stating Title IX protections apply to transgender people. But a proposal to make that guidance apply explicitly to women\u2019s athletics was shelved, and the broader rules were overturned last month by a federal judge.\n\nLia Thomas has not commented publicly on the latest lawsuit. Despite her expressed intention to keep swimming competitively after college, Thomas has been barred from international events by the rules of World Aquatics, which only qualify transgender athletes who have not experienced biological puberty.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport denied Thomas\u2019 challenge to the rule, making her ineligible for most elite competitions, including the 2024 Olympics.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jessie Yeung and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report.",

The other four injured remain hospitalized, police said.\n\nFoster is facing an aggravated murder charge, according to an arrest warrant filed in Licking County Court.\n\nThe shooting appears to have been targeted, authorities said, noting they were still working to determine a motive.\n\nThe suspect and victims all worked at the warehouse, and the suspect had been on site for several hours before he started shooting at about 10:30 p.m., Police Chief Greg Jones said. No conflict or confrontation appeared to prompt the violence, Jones added, noting that some of what happened was caught on camera.\n\nThe gunman had already fled in a rideshare service when officers arrived at the shooting scene, Jones said.\n\nOfficers evacuated the roughly 150 people from the warehouse to a nearby building, police said.\n\nA day after the shooting, Foster was located at a home in Columbus, and police deployed a Taser and took him into custody, authorities said.\n\nThe handgun used in the shooting was found in the warehouse and had been \u201clawfully purchased\u201d by Foster in September, Daryl McCormick, a special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Columbus Field Division, said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nKDC/One manufactures beauty, personal care and home care products, its website states.\n\nThe shooting is a \u201cheartbreaking and tragic situation,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cOur officers, alongside multiple agencies, responded swiftly to protect lives and secure the scene,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe train for situations like this, and while it is something no community ever wants to face, we were prepared to act quickly and effectively. We will continue working to bring this situation to a full resolution.\u201d\n\nThe incident was the 26th mass shooting in the US so far this year, according to a tally by the Gun Violence Archive and CNN. CNN and the GVA define a mass shooting as one that injures or kills four or more people, not including the shooter. Hundreds of people are killed on the job every year in the United States.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has called for criminal charges to be filed and arrests to be made after an autopsy report determined Black inmate Robert Brooks\u2019 fatal beating at the hands of correctional officers in December to be a homicide.\n\nRobert Brooks, a 43-year-old man serving a 12-year sentence for assault, died in the early hours of December 10 after he was beaten by correctional officers at Marcy Correctional Facility, an all-male state prison about 50 miles east of Syracuse, New York.\n\nThe report from the Onondaga County Medical Examiner lists Brooks\u2019 cause of death as \u201ccompression of the neck and multiple blunt force injuries and the manner\u201d of death as homicide, an attorney for Brooks\u2019 family, Elizabeth Mazur, told CNN.\n\nCNN has not obtained a copy of the report, as autopsy reports are treated as confidential medical records under New York County Law, according to the Onondaga County Medical Examiner\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe autopsy report confirms what was already clear: Robert Brooks\u2019 violent death was a homicide. We look forward to the prosecution of those responsible. In the meantime, we are pushing forward with our fight for justice for Mr. Brooks and his family,\u201d Mazur said in a statement on behalf of the family.\n\nHis death, and video that emerged of the beating, has enraged people across the country, along with inmates\u2019 relatives and activists, one of whom called the incident a symptom of a decades-long incarceration system \u201cdesigned to dehumanize the people it takes and puts behind the wall.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators rally in support of fatally beaten Marcy Correctional Facility inmate Robert Brooks ahead of Gov. Kathy Hochuls 2025 State of the State Address on Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025. Will Waldron/Albany Times Union/Hearst Newspapers/Getty Images\n\n\u201cNow that the Onondaga County Medical Examiner has ruled Mr. Brooks\u2019 death was a homicide, I believe the legal process must quickly move forward with criminal charges being filed and arrests being made,\u201d Hochul said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis reprehensible act of violence demands the full force of our justice system \u2014 the family of Mr. Brooks deserves no further delays.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and US Department of Justice are already reviewing the case, and the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office of Special Investigations has launched an investigation into Brooks\u2019 death.\n\nThe case is set to be presented to an Oneida County grand jury on February 10. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick told CNN he planned to comment after the grand jury releases its findings.\n\nHochul previously ordered state officials to initiate proceedings to fire employees implicated in the attack. More than a dozen individuals were suspended without pay. One officer quit. CNN has reached out to the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association for comment on the autopsy report.\n\nA 2022 report about Marcy from the Correctional Association of New York, which provides independent oversight of prisons in the state, notes multiple problems at the facility, including allegations of \u201cphysical assaults\u201d by staff on inmates and \u201cpervasive allegations of racial discrimination.\u201d\n\nAround 80% of inmates surveyed in the report said they had seen or been subjected to verbal, physical, or sexual abuse by staff. Inmates reported experiencing seemingly random assaults from the staff as well as targeted attacks meted out as punishment, the report found.\n\nThe governor announced the appointment of a new superintendent at Marcy Correctional Facility and expedited $400 million to install fixed cameras and distribute body-worn cameras at all Department of Corrections and Community Service (DOCCS) facilities after a visit to the facility following Brooks\u2019 death.\n\nCNN\u2019s Karina Tsui, Zoe Sottile, Raja Razek, and Emma Tucker contributed to this reporting.",

And his young son who was also in the car is now fighting for his life, his family says.\n\nThe twin-engine medevac jet carrying a child patient, her mother and the crew members crashed into a road in northeast Philadelphia on Friday night, showering flames and debris on homes and vehicles traveling on the street.\n\nFirst responders at the scene found a person dead inside one of the vehicles and the Philadelphia medical examiner\u2019s office has now positively identified that man as 37-year-old Steven Dreuitt from Philadelphia.\n\nAll six people aboard the jet were killed when it crashed, along with Dreuitt on the ground. At least 24 people on the ground were injured, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said Monday.\n\nDreuitt\u2019s son Ramesses was with his father when their car caught fire near the crash site Friday night, engulfing the 9-year-old\u2019s body in flames, Virgen Viera, the child\u2019s grandmother, told CNN affiliate KYW in a story published Tuesday.\n\nThe boy, who has burns on 90% of his body, was recovering in a burn unit in Boston, Viera said.\n\nThe family, who has asked for privacy, is focused on Ramesses\u2019 recovery.\n\n\u201cI trust in God. Trust in God,\u201d Viera told KYW.\n\nInvestigators working to determine the cause of the fiery crash have been collecting debris from the crash site, which spans four to six blocks, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said.\n\nThe plane\u2019s cockpit voice recorder was located at the site of initial impact, along with the airplane\u2019s enhanced ground proximity warning system, which could also contain flight data. Both have been sent to an NTSB laboratory in Washington, DC for evaluation, according to the agency.\n\nThe six people on the plane were Mexican nationals, Mexico\u2019s president said.\n\nOn board were a pediatric patient and her mother returning home to Mexico after the child had been treated in Philadelphia, said Shai Gold, spokesperson for flight operator Jet Rescue Air Ambulance. The girl was being treated for an illness at Shriners Children\u2019s Hospital in northeast Philadelphia, city officials said Saturday.\n\nFour crew members \u2013 a pilot, co-pilot, paramedic and doctor \u2013 were also on board the flight, which was scheduled to stop for refueling at the Springfield airport before continuing to its final destination of Tijuana, Mexico, Gold told CNN.",

                "text": "New Orleans CNN \u2014\n\nSecurity for the Super Bowl in New Orleans will feature more boots on the ground, more tech and more intelligence \u2013 spearheaded by a federal official who grew up 40 miles from where kickoff will take place.\n\nEric DeLaune, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations\u2019 New Orleans office and the lead federal coordinator for the Super Bowl, has been heading meetings with local police, city officials and leaders from federal law enforcement agencies \u2013 many of whom are from Louisiana and want to make sure the horrors of the New Year\u2019s truck attack in the city won\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cI did take (the attack) personally. And my people take it personally,\u201d DeLaune told CNN. \u201cThis whole security effort. Not a single person involved in the planning of the security effort for the Super Bowl was unaffected by this. They all take this very personally, and what I saw was a level of renewed commitment and renewed passion for the implementation of this plan.\u201d\n\nThat security plan is already visible in the French Quarter ahead of Sunday\u2019s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. There are armored vehicles, scores of heavily armed police officers, street blockades, drones and more \u2013 transforming the party-friendly, pedestrian-heavy Bourbon Street to a scene akin to the presidential inauguration.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, this is very similar to what we had in Washington, DC, just a matter of 10 days or two weeks ago,\u201d said US Rep. Dale Strong, a Republican from Alabama who visited the French Quarter on Monday. He particularly noted the number of K9s in place \u2013 \u201cevery dog you could imagine.\u201d\n\nThe security plan comes just over a month after a terrorist attack in which a man drove a pickup truck at high speed on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring dozens more before he crashed into construction equipment and was fatally shot by police. The assailant also placed two improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, on the street, with one in a rolling cooler and one in a bucket cooler. They did not explode.\n\nThe attack raised questions as to why the city didn\u2019t have functional security bollards or use certain other vehicle barriers on one of the most walkable streets in the country.\n\nIn the wake of that attack, Super Bowl security officials went back and reviewed their plans, said Cathy Lanier, NFL chief security officer.\n\n\u201cNaturally there\u2019s a question of whether we have made adjustments in our security plan in light of the events of January 1, and the answer is an unequivocal, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d she said this week.\n\n\u201cWe have reviewed and re-reviewed all the details of what happened on January 1. We have reviewed and re-reviewed each of our roles within the overarching security plan, and we have reassessed and stress-tested our timing, our communication protocols, our contingency measures and our emergency response plans multiple times over the past several weeks.\u201d\n\nEven before the January 1 attack, the Super Bowl \u2013 which President Donald Trump is expected to attend, according to a White House official \u2013 had one of the federal government\u2019s highest security assessments for special events, which unlocks significant federal resources and support. After the attack, federal officials not only helped tweak Super Bowl security plans, but also granted this special status and support \u2013 known as SEAR-1 \u2013 to New Orleans\u2019 Mardi Gras festivities from February 21 to March 4.\n\nSecurity efforts are evident for anyone walking Bourbon Street this week. Notably, the city created a \u201cFrench Quarter Enhanced Security Zone\u201d in which coolers and vehicles are prohibited, and any backpacks are subject to law enforcement search.\n\n\u201cIn the days ahead there will be a significant increase in law enforcement presence in New Orleans, some of which will be visible and obvious,\u201d DeLaune said on Monday. \u201cThis includes special response teams, drone technology, tactical personal and equipment, intelligence analyses and covert assets.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the increased security around the French Quarter, the nearby Caesars Superdome where the game will be, and surrounding areas.\n\nPolice, armored vehicles and drones\n\nThere are \u201cno specific credible threats\u201d around this weekend\u2019s Super Bowl, US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Monday.\n\nStill, with tens of thousands of football fans from Philadelphia, Kansas City and elsewhere headed to the Big Easy, a significant law enforcement presence will be in New Orleans just in case.\n\nThe biggest change in the safety plan since the New Year\u2019s attack is the visibility of the security, Lanier said last week.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re talking about thousands of sworn law enforcement that will be very visible, some not as visible,\u201d she said.\n\nAn armored police truck blocks part of Bourbon Street in the French Quarter on February 4. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe security package for the Super Bowl includes as many as 600 uniformed law enforcement members on the ground, patrolling the city, with emphasis around the French Quarter, DeLaune said. That includes tactical teams with long guns that will also be on patrol, with the idea that their presence is a deterrent.\n\nCheckpoints will be set up in the areas all around NFL-related events that take place in the week leading up to the game, DeLaune said.\n\nArmored tactical vehicles known as BearCats will also be deployed throughout the area, with as many as 16 being used to block street access to vehicles, DeLaune said. And these will be in addition to strong temporary barriers that were missing during the January 1 attack but started blocking off streets more than a week ahead of the Super Bowl. Even blast shields will be featured at certain high-risk areas, DeLaune said.\n\nDrones will be flying overhead, relaying images of crowds in real time to a cadre of law enforcement members who are analyzing the images, looking for any potential threats. And this is all in addition to investigators who have been combing through intelligence, looking for possible bad actors or even the most common fear among law enforcement, the lone wolf attacker.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration has generally prohibited drone flights for the public around the Superdome for much of the next week. \u201cThe FBI will have a drone detection system in place, monitoring the skies over the Superdome,\u201d said Stephen Cyrus, FBI special agent who was asked to assist in Super Bowl security, said in a news conference Monday.\n\nOutside the French Quarter\u2019s streets, there will be a massive show of force, including helicopters in the air and tactical boats in the water.\n\nWhat the French Quarter from a security perspective will look like once these major events are over remains to be seen.\n\nNew Orleans had been working since before the attack to install new street bollards intended to block vehicle access to Bourbon Street ahead of the Super Bowl. The removable bollards would help close the street to cars during pedestrian-only times but be stored away when cars are allowed, according to the city. The bollard work was expected to be completed by the end of last week, the city said.\n\nHowever, those new barriers are designed to only withstand vehicle impacts of 10 mph, according to a Reuters report. Last month, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced a plan to ask a tactical expert to review the city\u2019s security plans \u201cto determine whether or not these bollards are sufficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not, how, and what, and where do they need to be placed?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a work in progress, and we\u2019re committed to doing everything necessary to ensure public safety measures.\u201d\n\nOther security barriers, such as those that can be temporarily placed on a sidewalk to prevent a vehicle from advancing there, have also been present along Bourbon Street since the New Year\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cWe harden the places we can as best we can,\u201d DeLaune said.\n\nPeople walk along a vehicle carrying temporary barriers in New Orleans on February 2. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nConcerns about gun violence\n\nGun violence is a key concern as well, particularly at such a mass gathering.\n\nAt a Kansas City Super Bowl parade last year, a shootout stemming from a personal grievance left a woman dead, wounded about two dozen others and cast a pall on what had been a celebratory day.\n\nIn New Orleans, raucous parades and celebrations during the Mardi Gras period \u2013 which take place all around the city \u2013 have sometimes been the site of gun violence. A shooting along a parade route in 2023, for example, left one dead and four others injured, police said.\n\nThe Super Bowl does come amid a sharp decline in murders in the city since peaking in late 2022. From January to November 2024, New Orleans recorded 117 murders \u2013 a decline from the 188 in that same period a year before, according to the Real-Time Crime Index. Cities across the US have seen similar sharp drops in murders the last couple of years, since the end of Covid-related shutdowns, according to FBI data.\n\nOne new challenge for New Orleans law enforcement will be a law that began last summer allowing anyone over 18 to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Still, guns are not allowed in bars, casinos, government buildings or the Superdome, and some businesses around the French Quarter have posted signs saying, \u201cNo weapons allowed.\u201d\n\nGov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, confirmed concealed guns will generally be allowed in the French Quarter\u2019s Enhanced Security Zone.\n\n\u201cLook, we went through great lengths \u2026 to balance the freedoms and constitutional rights that are enshrined in this state while making sure that we had enough security to protect our citizens,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nEven with the added security measures, the key is the average person walking by who might see a suspicious package or abandoned cooler, DeLaune said.\n\n\u201cThe most important person in this whole event are the people here to enjoy it, that they would keep their eyes open,\u201d DeLaune said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Eric Levenson wrote and reported from New York, while CNN\u2019s Mark Morales, Ryan Young and Jason Morris reported from New Orleans.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nNewly released data from ground-based radar came out Tuesday suggesting an Army helicopter was flying higher than it was supposed to be when it collided with American Airlines Flight 5342 a week ago, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.\n\nAccording to the \u201cbest quality flight track data\u201d available, the helicopter was flying at about 300 feet at the time of the midair collision with the plane on its approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport outside Washington, DC, according to a statement Tuesday evening from the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThis data is rounded to the nearest 100 feet,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was flying a training mission in a dedicated helicopter route where it was not allowed to fly above 200 feet, according to a published FAA chart. Since the accident above the Potomac River, the Federal Aviation Administration has indefinitely suspended the use of most of those routes.\n\nTuesday\u2019s update from the NTSB doesn\u2019t fully clarify an already murky situation. Although the air traffic control display at Reagan National should have shown the Black Hawk was flying at about 300 feet, the agency said it is continuing to collect data on its position, work that will not be finished until the helicopter wreckage can be pulled from the water. That is not expected to happen until next week.\n\nConflicting information about what controllers saw\n\nNTSB board member J. Todd Inman stated over the weekend the airport tower\u2019s radar was showing the Black Hawk altitude at 200 feet with the Bombardier CRJ700 jet\u2019s flight data recorder reading 325 feet, a discrepancy that investigators could not immediately explain.\n\nThe NTSB canceled previously announced news briefings on its investigation Monday and Tuesday and has not made officials available for questions on the Tuesday evening update.\n\nThe so-called black boxes containing the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from both aircraft have been recovered. The NTSB says it is still working to synchronize the recordings, but board chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN\u2019s Pete Muntean on Monday they will release what they can when they can.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of the information is critical to the investigation, and the NTSB is about transparency,\u201d she said.\n\nOfficials have warned against a rush to judgment on the cause of what is the deadliest US aviation disaster since the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in 2001. Still, figuring out how high the Army helicopter was at the time of the collision is considered key to determining how two aircraft flying in one of the nation\u2019s most heavily regulated airspace corridors under clear skies could run into each other.\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not wait for an investigative report before weighing in.\n\n\u201cThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot,\u201d the president posted last Friday on Truth Social. \u201cIt was far above the 200 foot limit. That\u2019s not really too complicated to understand, is it?\u201d\n\nThe newly released altitude information was collected by Potomac TRACON, the air traffic control unit that coordinates aircraft arrivals and departures at multiple airports in the region, including Dulles International in Virginia and Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. That facility, about 40 miles west of Reagan National, uses information from multiple radar sensors and telemetry transmitted from aircraft to pinpoint their positions, according to the NTSB.\n\nInvestigators piecing plane back together\n\nThe recovery of the jet wreckage from the Potomac continued Wednesday as weather conditions deteriorated in Washington. Wreckage from the jet \u201chas been offloaded from the barge and transferred to a secure location for a full wreckage layout and examination,\u201d the NTSB said in an update.\n\nThe NTSB\u2019s examination will account for major portions of the aircraft, witness marks on the aircraft structure and fracture surfaces, \u201cgeneral airworthiness\u201d of the aircraft, along with cockpit switch positions and instrument readings, the investigative update said.\n\nRecovery efforts will continue in the Potomac on Thursday, the update said.\n\nVideo footage showed crews removing large parts of the jet on Wednesday, including a portion of the plane\u2019s fuselage with the name \u201cAmerican Eagle\u201d on it.\n\nThe wreckage was transferred, one piece at a time, from a barge to a flatbed truck parked only a couple of hundred feet from the airport\u2019s main runway.\n\nThe recovery of the helicopter will begin after the wreckage of the jet is removed from the water, which is expected to be complete Thursday, Unified Command said.\n\nCrews have recovered and identified all 67 victims, officials said Wednesday.\n\nA preliminary report on the cause of the crash is expected within 30 days. A final report can take more than a year, but the NTSB chair says she hopes this investigation won\u2019t take that long.\n\n\u201cI would hope it would be much less than that,\u201d Homendy said.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the previous deadliest aviation disaster in the US in 2001.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump is seeking to end birthright citizenship in the US, a nearly 160-year-old practice guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born on American soil. But realizing this controversial order will be challenging as it is already facing major legal hurdles.\n\nThe US is among dozens of countries, mostly in the Americas, that grant unconditional birthright citizenship to anyone born in its territory under a legal principle known as jus soli, Latin for \u201cright of the soil.\u201d\n\nSome other countries grant birthright citizenship with conditions. Spain, for example, requires at least one of the parents to also be born in the country. And Chile does not give citizenship to children born to foreigners who are staying temporarily.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s argument for ending birthright citizenship relies on the clause \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d in the Constitution\u2019s statement.\n\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. 14th Amendment to the US Constitution\n\nThe administration claims that children born to undocumented immigrants, or to foreigners who are in the US legally but on temporary visas, are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the US and therefore not citizens.\n\nSo far, Trump\u2019s order has been met with legal pushback.\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal judge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction preventing its enforcement. This follows last month\u2019s decision from another judge, who issued a temporary restraining order to block it, calling Trump\u2019s order \u2018blatantly unconstitutional\u2019.\n\nMore than 20 states, mostly led by Democrats, have filed lawsuits in two different federal courts arguing that the president has no authority to change or override a constitutional amendment. Civil rights groups and expectant parents have brought similar legal action.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s order \u2014 assuming it survives court challenges \u2014 would not strip citizenship from children already born in the US before it takes effect, its implementation would affect millions of migrants if they have children.\n\nThe US had around 22.9 million immigrants who were not naturalized citizens as of 2023 \u2013 including green card holders, those on temporary student or work visas and unauthorized migrants, according to data from the US Census Bureau. They make up nearly 7% of the whole population, and more than half were born in Latin America.\n\nFurther data shows trends that highlight the significant share of immigrants in US births. In 2023, 86% of children under 18 in immigrant families were US-born, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The number of such children has more than doubled over the past three decades.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2024, an average of 860,000 babies were born to foreign-born mothers each year, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics. While total births in the US have broadly declined over the past decade, the fall has been steeper among US-born mothers than foreign-born mothers.\n\nThe case against Trump\u2019s order could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, which ruled in an 1898 landmark case that people born within US territory are citizens even if their parents are not.\n\nApart from being considered \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d multiple polls conducted last month find ending birthright citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants is unpopular with the public, with just below one-third expressing support in surveys from AP/NORC and Quinnipiac University.",

Specifically, in spaces that aren't considered the \"norm.\"\n\nBrian Tankersley\n\n\"When I was growing up and I just went to museums, I saw a lot of sculptures that had Eurocentric features, or if they were Black, they would be slaves,\" Merriweather said.\n\n\"I also want little girls to go to museums to feel proud of themselves. When I was growing up, I had really Afro hair... but I make sculptures like that because I want things to be relatable.\"\n\nSome of her sculptures feature things like green braids, bantu knots, earrings and grills.\n\nBrian Tankersley\n\n\"I want us to be able to be like, 'Yo like, I saw a sculpture that looked like me, or my dad, or my mom in this really cool museum,'\" Merriweather said with a smile.\n\nHer journey led her from drawing to ceramics, and this is in part thanks to her brother.\n\nHe asked her what she wanted to do with her life and she replied, \"Truthfully, I want to play in clay all day.\"\n\nWhen she was on her ceramics journey, she started small with cups, but now she's making full-scale projects like one titled \"Simi.\"\n\n\"He's one of the first pieces that I made that was big, but also unapologetically talking about the stereotypes that Black people have to come across.\"\n\nHe's also part of her \"Grill series,\" and not the George Foreman kind. We're talking about the teeth jewelry Nelly rapped about in the early 2000's.\n\nBrian Tankersley\n\nThe series aims to dispel stereotypes surrounding the jewelry.\n\nMurjoni speaks on her experience with grills Murjoni speaks about wearing grills\n\nEverything is intentional with Merriweather's designs. They have big smiles to shine past any negative comments and small ears to block out outward opinions.\n\nHer latest project even caught the attention of the NFL. She made a sculpture of Lamar Jackson for the NFL's Artist Replay Program, where artists show football fandom by creating work.\n\nBrian Tankersley\n\n\"I was selected to be a part of the NFL Artist Replay Program, where they select artists to be mentored by Cam Kirk during Art Basel and then we also show football fandom by creating work.\"\n\nMerriweather was contacted by an NFL representative, and the Jackson sculpture spent weekend in Miami at Art Basel, a show featuring artists from all over the world.\n\nNow, the sculpture is back home with her.\n\nIt may not look exactly like Jackson because its just supposed to embody the quarterback's energy.\n\nIf you're just discovering Merriweather for the first time, she just wants people to feel proud.\n\nBrian Tankersley\n\n\"I want to be able to take someone outside of the real world and put them inside of an actual feeling, in a place where they can feel vulnerable.\"",

HE'S BEEN ARRESTED FOR OTHER TIMES FOR BATTERY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AN\n\nAdvertisement Parents disarm teen threatening kids with gun at Cape Coral park Share Copy Link Copy\n\nGulf Coast News spoke to a parent and coach who disarmed a 13-year-old boy accused of threatening children at gunpoint at a Cape Coral park.Christopher Nicholsen says he is a softball coach and was holding practice Tuesday night when he heard other parents saying there was a teen with a gun.\"One of the parents had come to the fence line and started yelling, there's a there's a kid at the playground with a gun,\" Nicholsen said.Immediately, Nicholsen and other parents began looking for the child wearing a red and black striped shirt. That's when they began questioning the child.\"One of the fathers had asked him, were you the one with the gun? And he immediately said, no, it's just a BB gun,\" Nicholsen said. \"He withdrew and he brought his shirt up, I immediately recognized it as a firearm, actually, one that I owned myself personally.\"Nicholsen said the teen lowered his hand down to his waistband and looked as if he was going to draw on Nicholsen.\"It was a flight or flight response at that point in time, and I proceeded to basically block his hand away and get kind of control of the firearm, and I was able to disarm them at that time,\" he said.Cape Coral police says that the teenager was 13-year-old Jiovanni Peguero. Parents held Peguero until police arrived.The Cape Coral Police Department says the incident began when officers received a call from a family reporting that their child had been held at gunpoint by another minor in northeast Cape Coral, who then stole their scooter. The victim immediately informed their family, who contacted the police.As officers were investigating the case, they received another report of a child being threatened with a weapon at Burton Park. Law enforcement worked quickly to determine if the two incidents were connected.\"The description of that weapon matched the gun that was used in the second case as well.,\" said Lisa Greenberg, public information officer for the Cape Coral Police Department. \"Their guardian had noticed that their gun was missing. So it all kind of worked out that this was a situation that was connected.\"Police confirmed that both incidents were connected and took the 13-year-old into custody. Officers also noted that this was not the first time the suspect had been involved in serious criminal activity.Greenberg emphasized the importance of parental involvement in preventing these types of crimes.\"The whole situation is very sad. It's, you know, sad. As a family member of this particular suspect, it's also cited as a community to hear that someone this young is involved in crimes like this,\" she said.People who know Peguero say they wouldn't have expected this from him.\"Yeah, it's crazy, man. I wouldn't have guessed that, though,\" Ahmed Henry said.Henry said Peguero has battled issues at home for a while.\"You know, but I never really, like, got the gist of their relationship with him and with his dad. But all I know is he was, like, always run away from home. I was talking about some home problems or whatnot,\" Henry said. \"He told me his whole life and everything that's going on with him and I, you know, I kind of felt for him.The 13-year-old now faces serious charges, including aggravated assault and possessing a weapon.Nicholsen said he considered one 12-year-old the hero of this story for recognizing the situation, clearing the playground, and alerting parents.\"Difference that that child was raised right. He knew to do that. He didn't overreact to the situation. Some kids might have got defensive or started an altercation. Know that kid handled everything. You know, he's got a bright future,\" Nicholsen said.The investigation remains ongoing.",

Smith said her 10 chickens are now part of the family.\n\n\"They all have their own little names,\" said Smith. \"I come out here, they like flock to me.\"\n\nSmall farms like Smith\u2019s are legal in Palm Beach County but not allowed in Port St. Lucie. A petition with over 300 signatures hopes to change that.\n\nAngelina Smith tells WPTV how having chickens has benefited her\n\nPort St. Lucie residents petition to allow backyard chickens due to egg shortages, rising egg prices\n\nOne commenter named Courtney, pointed to the rising egg prices and wrote, \"Everyone should be allowed this freedom.\"\n\nOther people mentioned egg shortages, something Smith doesn\u2019t have to worry about.\n\n\"I just go to my backyard and I grab eggs when I need it,\u201d said Smith. \"If I need to bake a cake, I need two eggs, and I don't have any in the house, I just come to the coop and they're there.\"\n\nSmith said short term that building a co-op and buying feed can cost a lot, but long term it helps.\n\n\"Even if egg prices go up in the store. I don't even recognize it with my grocery bill,\" said Smith.\n\nBackyard farms are legal in unincorporated St. Lucie County for up to five chickens. Since 2021, 48 people have applied and 13 have been approved. County commissioner Cathy Townsend voted in favor of the ordinance after similar petitions and requests.\n\n\"It's worked in the county, and it's working in our neighborhoods,\" said Smith.\n\nWPTV reached out to the city of Port St Lucie and a spokesperson said the followng:\n\n\u201cRaising chickens has been determined to be incompatible with the city\u2019s design and a population that now surpasses 250,000.\u201d\n\nTownsend told WPTV she thinks the city should reconsider and give residents a crack at it.\n\n\"It\u2019s the right thing, especially with the times that we're in today,\" said Townsend. \"It's an animal, it's a pet, it's a need, it's an economic factor.\"",

YOU. WANT TO GET AN\n\nAdvertisement ICE takes custody of 19-year-old after pleading guilty to groping 72-year-old woman in Cape Coral Share Copy Link Copy\n\nA 19-year-old man, Luis Garcia, is now in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after pleading guilty to groping a 72-year-old woman in Cape Coral.Garcia had initially been facing a third-degree felony charge of battery on a person 65 years or older, but instead, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge. In court on Wednesday, Luis Garcia was sentenced to a 30-day work program, 12 months of probation, and an anger management program. Garcia, who believed he would walk out of the Lee County courthouse a free man, was unaware that ICE agents were waiting outside. As soon as the sentencing was concluded, Garcia was taken into custody by immigration authorities.The victim, Angela Johnson, spoke exclusively with NBC2, recalling the distressing encounter that occurred eight months ago. While out for a walk in her neighborhood near Durden Parkway in Cape Coral, Johnson was groped by Garcia, a construction worker. She vividly remembers the moment, which has since affected her daily life.\"I felt it brought tears to my eyes a little bit,\" Johnson said, describing the emotions she felt when facing Garcia in court. \"It made me sort of relive that moment.\" \"Every day I go for a walk, I think about it. Sometimes I get emotional talking about it, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to sleep,\" Johnson said, fighting back tears. \"Lately, when my grandkids run up and grab me, I tell them not to grab me from the back. I ask them to do it from the side or the front because it startles me.\"This week, Johnson finally got the justice she had been waiting for.Garcia's defense attorney responded with this statement:\"We are obviously very saddened by the fact that this young man is likely to be deported for a relatively minor charge that he apologized for. Nonetheless the victim has always wanted him to be deported and quite likely she's going to get her desire. As a citizen I certainly hope we focus in and narrow down those individuals which pose the greatest danger to our society when it comes to detention and deportation efforts and expenditures.\"",

Kathy Hochul announced Friday that inspectors have found seven cases of bird flu during routine inspections this past week in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nThose stores were shut down immediately. For the 80 or so remaining uninfected stores, they must finish selling their live inventory by next Monday, clean and disinfect, then keep their doors shuttered for five days.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution and to thwart any further transmission, we're issuing a notice and order to temporarily shut down all live bird markets in New York City, as well as in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties,\" Hochul said.\n\nHochul said the shutdown will last for a week, until next Friday.\n\n\"For a weeklong period, no poultry can be delivered to those live bird markets,\" Hochul said.\n\nThe markets will then be inspected before they are allowed to reopen.\n\nAssemblywoman Linda Rosenthal said the decision to allow uninfected markets to sell all inventory before closing is not safe.\n\n\"I think that's a big mistake to sell out the inventory. Have they tested every bird? Have they tested all the products that they're selling? What's better is that they be safely discarded. The state should help out those businesses that are losing revenue,\" Rosenthal said. \"They're near the bird, they touch them.\"\n\nHealth officials say it is safe to sell the inventory.\n\n\"There is no immediate public health threat,\" Hochul says\n\n\"These are just simply measured common sense steps that will curb the spread of bird flu and ultimately to keep New Yorkers safe, which is always my top priority,\" Hochul said.\"Now I want to reiterate that people should not be concerned. Let me be clear, there is no immediate public health threat.\"\n\n\"The New York State Department Health is using all the tools at its disposal the monitor for avian influenza in human beings, and we're prepared for widespread testing should the need arise,\" New York Department of Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. \"At this time, there's no human cases of avian influenza that have been diagnosed in New York State. And just to give you some context, we've had 67 cases in the United States since 2022. Right now, the New York State Department of Health assesses the threat to the public as low. There's no immediate public health threat.\"\n\n\"The people most at risk becoming infected with H5N1 are people who have contact with infected birds or infected poultry, cattle or other animals,\" McDonald added. \"I would like to remind everyone in general, you should avoid contact with dead or ill birds, you know, and for folks that do keep chickens, ducks or geese, you should familiarize yourselves with clinical signs of avian influenza and contact a veterinarian or the New York State Department of [Agriculture] and Markets if multiple birds die suddenly.\"\n\n\"The current risk to New Yorkers of bird flu (H5N1) remains low. Avian influenza viruses only present a wider risk if the virus develops the ability to transmit between people \u2013 which we have not seen,\" New York City Health Department Acting Commissioner Michelle Morse said.\n\nIt's important to note the transmission threats of bird flu to humans remain extremely low. Properly cooking and preparing poultry and eggs kills the bacteria that carries the bird flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nShutdown will impact businesses, families\n\nQuality Live Poultry in Queens is one of the markets that will temporarily shut down.\n\n\"West Indians, we come and get our duck, our chicken, weekends, celebrate,\" Barrat Khan said. \"It's going to impact us a lot.\"\n\nWhile communities rely on the poultry markets, residents say health and safety comes first.\n\n\"We just have have to abide by the rules. If it needs to be closed, it needs to be closed,\" Khan said.\n\nAt Rana's Live Poultry in the Bronx, customer after customer saw the closed sign, and were disappointed.\n\n\"It surprised me a little bit, because I come here all the time to buy chicken, which is good. See, now I gotta go back home, no chicken,\" Sandy Brito said. \"It's more fresh. The meat feels good. We really need this.\"\n\nFor many, buying live chickens at poultry shops isn't a preference, it's a religious and cultural requirement.\n\n\"Because we're Muslim, we are required to have Muslim person slaughter chicken,\" Nabeel Alhalmi said. \"Where are we going to buy chicken? From where? That's the only place we buy chicken from.\"\n\n\"It's vey important for this place to be open,\" Alhalmi added.\n\nBird flu driving up prices, but for how long?\n\nRecently, federal agricultural workers euthanized an entire flock of 100,000 ducks at a farm in Suffolk County, New York due to bird flu.\n\nThe national bird flu outbreak has driven egg prices up, and some small business owners have had to raise prices of New York City staples, like the classic bodega bacon, egg and cheese.\n\nExperts with Cornell University said it could take some time for egg prices to decrease, since it can take 6-9 months to get egg production flowing again from a flock that has been depopulated.\n\nNYC zoos impacted by bird flu\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society announced Friday that three ducks at the Queens Zoo have died due to avian influenza.\n\nAt the Bronx Zoo, they say nine wild birds and three collection ducks that may have been exposed to the virus have died, but they are waiting on lab tests to confirm the causes of death.\n\nAs a precaution, vulnerable bird species have been moved to protected areas in Wildlife Conservation Society parks.\n\nOfficials say the parks will remain open to the public, as there is little risk of visitors coming into contact with any birds.\n\nDoctors say the risk of human transmission is low.\n\n\"About 67 people have acquired avian flu thus far, but all of them have had direct contact either with wild birds, livestock or dairy farmers. So I want to reiterate, there's no sustained human-to-human transmission,\" one doctor said.\n\nThere's more information about safety measures online here. People are urged to report sick or dead birds to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets at 518-457-3502 for poultry, or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at 518-478-2203 for wild birds.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

                "text": "EAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Nearly two years after the devastating shooting at Michigan State University, the MSU community is using art to heal through its exhibition, 'Art in the Aftermath: Healing Gun Violence through Artivism'. The community was invited to take part in one of its programs Friday afternoon at the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum on campus called the 'Perspectives on Gun Violence Roundtable'. Over a dozen students and community leaders joined the public discussion as speakers shared their different viewpoints in addressing the issue of gun violence.\n\nAlina Hauter/FOX 17 Images from the Soul Box Project\n\nSecond-year MSU medical student, Andi Nations, was there representing SAFE, Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic. Nations had just been accepted into MSU's medical school when the shooting occurred.\n\n\"I remember getting a bunch of texts from people that I knew asking me if I was okay. And I told them, yeah, I'm still in California. I'd actually never been to Michigan yet,\" Nations said. \"And I remember thinking about everybody that day and thinking about the mass shooting that I went to when I was a first responder at King Estates in Oakland, [California] and the aftermath of that.\"\n\nAlina Hauter/FOX 17 Andi Nations shares their experience as a first-responder.\n\nIt's why Nations shared their experience and how the national organization, SAFE, hopes to prevent gun violence by viewing it through a perspective of public health.\n\n\"It is an issue that we see over and over again, and all of us are potential future gunshot victims, and that it's so easy to feel powerless in that,\" said Nations. \"We have three pillars, advocacy, research and education. And essentially what we do is we treat firearm violence as a public health issue, which it is.\"\n\nThey said preventative measures could start with something as simple as a doctor's appointment.\n\n\"Every pediatrician should be asking the patient's parents, \"Is there a gun in your home? How is it stored?\" Because for your safety and everyone else's, these problems are preventable if we work to prevent them,\" Nations added.\"And if we're able to ask the questions and get the funding to study them, then we can do something about this problem.\"\n\nAlina Hauter/FOX 17 Michael Lynn Jr adds his perspective to the discussion on gun violence.\n\nTheirs was just one perspective at the roundtable. Michael Lynn Jr. is the CEO of the Lansing Empowerment Network, an organization that \"aims to build a stronger community through collaboration.\"\n\n\"We are bringing together initiatives and the community around initiatives to work upstream on the gun violence,\" Lynn said.\n\nThe organization is able to strengthen the communication between law enforcement and the community by holding a weekly virtual meeting.\n\n\"We hold a meeting called Lansing 360 where we bring law enforcement, community groups, everybody from, you know, municipality leaders, mayors, so on and so forth, all to the conversation around gun violence once a week, every Wednesday from 12 to one,\" said Lynn. \"Since we've been doing this for about a year and a half, our numbers have gone down 20% in the City of Lansing.\"\n\nAlina Hauter/FOX 17 Images from the Soul Box Project\n\nDiscussants also included members of MSU's College of Human Medicine and Advance Peace Lansing.\n\n\"People all over the country deal with this. It doesn't matter if you're rural or urban, what your race is, gun violence doesn't really care,\" said Aron Sousa, Dean of MSU's College of Human Medicine. \"And so, it's how we take care of each other, how we protect each other. When people are depressed or or stressed, it's just about taking care of each other.\"\n\nLynn and Nations hope the conversations at the roundtable will invite others to view the issue of gun violence with a different perspective.\n\n\"I love when people start expanding their minds around how we can affect change with this. This is how, you know, cures come up, how we find penicillin and all these different things from this conversation. What have you tried? What hasn't worked? So, we save a lot of time when we talk about what people have tried, what didn't work, what does work,\" Lynn said.\n\nAlina Hauter/FOX 17\n\n\"I think it's really inspiring. I think a lot of people are doing this work, and it's important, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, to find the people that are already doing this work, because there are a lot of people who have really good ideas and just need your help,\" said Nations.\n\nThe roundtable was just one aspect of the week-long exhibition, which will be open till Thursday. Events included a student-film premiere Friday night and a spoken-word event which will take place on Saturday. Visitors can even contribute their own thoughts and messages on the nation's gun violence problem to the Soul Box Project in the exhibition.\n\nMSU holds roundtable on gun violence nearly two years after shooting\n\nFollow FOX 17: Facebook - X (formerly Twitter) - Instagram - YouTube",

It also doesn\u2019t apply when an individual is masturbating, donating sperm or if the intercourse takes place between members of the LGBTQ+ community and thus doesn't \"produce ova.\"\n\nSo what this would apply to is sex without a condom and without actually wanting to procreate.\n\nThis felony would cost violators thousands of dollars, with a max of $10,000 per discharge.\n\n\"It's beyond ridiculous what's going on here,\" Republican activist Austin Beigel laughed. \"It's a mockery of the most basic biological concepts.\"\n\nThe humorous aspect is something both Beigel and Somani agree on.\n\n\"If you think it's absurd to regulate men, then you should think it's equally absurd to regulate women,\" Somani responded.\n\n\"So this is to make a statement,\" I said.\n\n\"It is a statement,\" Somani giggled.\n\nVoters overwhelmingly legalized and protected the right to abortion in 2023.\n\nIssue 1 passed 57-43%, and it enshrined reproductive rights into the state constitution. Ohioans have the right to make their own decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care and continuing pregnancy. The state is prohibited from interfering with or penalizing someone for exercising this right.\n\nDespite this, anti-abortion advocates like Beigel are trying to reverse it. He is the president of End Abortion Ohio.\n\nHe said that in the coming weeks, lawmakers will introduce a new bill to criminalize abortion totally.\n\n\"It just says human life begins at conception,\" he told me. \"Therefore, all the protections that are offered to other people under the state law are also offered to the preborn.\"\n\nBeigel has been keeping me updated for years on his efforts to rid the state of abortion.\n\n\"Our bill is the Ohio Prenatal Equal Protection Act,\" he continued. \"It will be being introduced very soon.\"\n\nThe advocate believes his legislation could hold up in court because of an equal protection provision in the US Constitution. His idea would be to use the 14th Amendment to rule that the state constitution is now in violation of said clause.\n\nLegal experts have routinely criticized this argument, saying it won't hold up.\n\nBeigel knows this will be a legal challenge, but he is also trying to normalize the idea of a total ban. By continuing to introduce it, it may get passed further down the line, he argued.\n\nCLICK HERE to learn more about his progress.\n\nOhio court rules clinics can now prescribe abortion pill virtually\n\nRELATED: Ohio court rules clinics can now prescribe abortion pill virtually\n\n\"Would this bill be going against the will of the voters?\" I asked Beigel.\n\n\"Yeah, look back at American history... The issue of slavery was popular with the majority at certain times, and so it is absolutely possible for the majority of a state's populist to support something that's evil and something that's wrong,\" he responded.\n\nSomani has criticized that argument throughout the years for being inaccurate, while Democrats have called it racist to suggest abortion is similar to slavery.\n\nThe nonstop effort of anti-abortion activists is one of the reasons why this legislation is needed, the Democrat said.\n\n\"Just like abortion bills have penalized physicians or created felonies for physicians and patients, the intent of the bill is to show that we should not be policing any anybody's reproductive rights,\" Somani said.\n\nBeigel added that he understands that Somani is being satirical but that she is missing the mark.\n\n\"The pro-life movement has never tried to regulate women's bodies,\" he said. \"We're trying to regulate the actions of people who want to kill another person.\"\n\nThe bill is invasive and isn\u2019t based on science, he continued, questioning how the Democrats are spending their time.\n\n\"If they think that it's a waste of taxpayer money, well, then they should think the same on the other side,\" the doctor responded.\n\nShe is also sick of the Republicans choosing which bills are \"jokes\" or not since she thinks their legislation \"destroying public education in the state\" or \"not supporting kids getting free meals at school\" is absurd.\n\n\"I think this hits the idea of \"Republican freedom\" and \"men's freedom,\" and so that's why it's touching such a big nerve,\" Somani said.\n\nThis bill likely isn\u2019t conceivable in the GOP-controlled legislature, but it is heating up the conversation.",

                "text": "The GenAI boom of the last few years has unleashed a wave of startups promising to support the process of prompt engineering \u2014 i.e., coming up with instructions to precisely steer an AI chatbot to serve useful output. So think tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, which present the user with a blank field for their query \u2014 and where what you ask and also how you ask it can lead to very different results.\n\nNew York-based PromptLayer got into this space early, launching a tool to help app developers manage the prompting process around two years ago. Its founders had been playing around with AI chatbots themselves and wanted something to keep track of their own prompting, recounts co-founder Jared Zoneraich (a TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon alum, pictured above left with co-founder Jonathan Pedoeem).\n\nOn a bit of a whim, they put their MVP out there (on X) and the tool they\u2019d built for themselves made a splash, so they kept building. It\u2019s since evolved into a prompt management product they\u2019re selling to third-party businesses to support their development of AI apps, suggesting the founders hit the right timing to cater to growing interest from businesses in how large language models (LLMs) might help boost their productivity.\n\nWhile the prompt support space has heated up considerably in the years since PromptLayer released an MVP they\u2019ve gone on to build out a fully featured prompt management platform \u2014 offering a visual interface packed with tools for managing and monitoring the process of trying to extract the best value from LLMs.\n\nNow they\u2019ve closed a $4.8 million seed raise to continue building momentum for their approach. The round is led by Ivan Bercovich (ScOp Venture Capital), with Peter Boyce II (Stellation Capital) participating again (he also funded their pre-seed), along with several angels and AI founders and operators \u2014 including Michael Akilian, Joshua Browder, Byrne Hobart, Romain Huet, Josh Kamdjou, Logan Kilpatrick, Ben Lang, Alex Oppenheimer, Gokul Rajaram, Gabriel Stengel, and Luis Voloch.\n\nKeeping tabs on prompts\n\nZoneraich says the core of PromptLayer\u2019s product is a \u201cprompt registry.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s CMS, it\u2019s version control for prompts,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have a prompt, you create a new version, you could see why versions are different, and then you could choose which version\u2019s your production version \u2026 That\u2019s like the center of our product \u2014 and everything kind of expands out from that and tries to make that more useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, tests on top of that, or logs on top of that of when you use which prompt, or A/B tests between the prompts, and kind of like deeper insights into which version is the best one.\u201d\n\nThe platform is designed to support customers to test and evaluate different prompts for their particular app use case \u2014 say an AI coaching app or a chatbot for customer support \u2014 letting them test how different versions of prompts perform across a range of LLMs; and, more generally, get a better handle on this brave new world of app development where the language required to command cutting-edge tech is, mostly, just words (rather than code).\n\nUnusually for a dev tools maker, PromptLayer is deliberately focused on non-technical users.\n\nZoneraich says they made a conscious choice to build a prompt management business geared toward what he refers to as \u201cdomain experts\u201d \u2014 i.e., professionals with key expertise in their field, whether that\u2019s education, legal, healthcare, and so on \u2014 after they found early users were bringing non-coders to the app development party.\n\n\u201cWe believe you can\u2019t build healthcare AI without doctors, legal AI without lawyers, or therapy AI without therapists,\u201d the startup writes in a mission statement that says its software tooling \u201callows domain experts and engineers to collaborate using our visual prompt CMS.\u201d\n\nZoneraich goes further \u2014 saying the platform puts domain experts in the \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d of app development.\n\n\u201cThis becomes something they need to sort of be trained in \u2014 but it\u2019s not a huge leap,\u201d he suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that they have to learn to code. So it\u2019s something that the average person could pick up.\u201d\n\nTaking a different tack\n\nGiven how GenAI has cracked open the AI toolbox \u2014 thanks, in large part, to OpenAI\u2019s decision to embed generative AI in an accessible, natural language interface \u2014 the choice to focus on tools for non-technical users makes logical sense. Yet, Zoneraich reckons it sets them apart from the majority of players in the space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a very different approach than everyone else,\u201d he suggests during a call with TechCrunch. \u201cThis whole concept of domain experts leading the charge \u2014 basically nobody\u2019s doing that. I think we learned it from our customers. But in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s kind of a little bit less sexy to build for the non-technical, rather than the technical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to convince anyone this is the right way to do it. I think the market will do that talking for us,\u201d he goes on, arguing: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can win in a lot of these domains without employing domain experts [to do prompt engineering].\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough engineers anyway, even if we wanted to staff everything with engineers.\u201d\n\nOn the technically focused AI tools side, Zoneraich name-checks the likes of Zapier \u2014 as well as pointing to what he refers to as \u201cLLM ops\u201d companies like Braintrust and LangChain \u2014 when we discuss the competitive landscape. \u201cBut I think everybody\u2019s over fitting on that [tools for technical users],\u201d he contends, saying it\u2019s his conviction that for most companies seeking to leverage the power of LLMs, the relevant domain experts for the app they\u2019ll want to build will not be technical staff.\n\nHe also reckons the skills required to be a good prompt engineer are not necessarily the same as those that make for a good programmer.\n\n\u201cThe skill of prompt engineering is not 100% correlated with engineers. There\u2019s a subsection, but it\u2019s really, like, a tinker type of skill [that\u2019s required] \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m just gonna try this random thing, and then I\u2019m gonna see what the output is,\u2019\u201d he tells us. \u201cSome people try to really plan it out and do research on what the prompt should be. And in my opinion, those people are not good at [prompt engineering] because there\u2019s not really a science.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the less you try to understand the LLM, the better you are,\u201d he added.\n\nBuilding demand\n\nZoneraich is bullish on how large the market need will be for tools to get the best out of LLMs. Nor is he concerned that this newly emerged field of prompt engineering will end up a blip in the history of work that\u2019s quickly steamrollered by fresh developments in the fast-paced GenAI market.\n\nEven an AGI \u2014 were such a generally intelligent AI to be brought into being \u2014 would need something to work with, he argues, implying that humans are still going to need some form of tooling/support to nudge the machines for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is, what do I do with it? The hard part is, what task do I give it to solve?\u201d he says, underscoring PromptLayer\u2019s confidence that it\u2019s building tooling for the long term. \u201cThe hard part is defining what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you believe there\u2019s no one perfect solution to a lot of these problems, there are infinite ways to solve it, and that\u2019s the job of the prompt engineer \u2014 to choose what problem am I even solving? What is the context to solve the problem?\u201d he goes on.\n\n\u201cThe LLM is kind of just the tool to go from problem definition to solution, but you\u2019re just moving the abstraction layer \u2026 We moved it away from machine code to modern programming languages. Then we moved it from modern programming languages to prompts. And maybe we\u2019re going to move it from raw prompts to be like input to the prompts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, you still need some input. There\u2019s that irreducible part of it.\u201d\n\nThe seed round will be used to expand the team (currently eight-strong), with a focus on adding in-house engineering talent to ensure quality and reliability of service for customers, per Zoneraich. He says they also want to expand the platform to serve more use cases and grow usage \u2014 as well as putting effort and energy into community building to help nurture this unfolding field of prompt engineering.\n\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s not out on what a prompt engineer looks like or what a prompt engineer is. And I think it\u2019s our job to kind of build a community around this \u2014 be like a pioneer of this prompt engineering field and show people how to do it. So that\u2019s a big focus.\u201d\n\nPromptLayer isn\u2019t disclosing how many paying customers it has for its tools as yet \u2014 but Zoneraich says they have over 10,000 free and paid customers who have gone through their website. (ParentLab and OpenAI-backed Speak are two paying customers he names.)\n\nThe startup has also seen 13x revenue growth this year \u2014 and it claims this rapid revenue growth is purely through word-of-mouth \u201cas teams discover they need domain experts, not just engineers, to build AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll it takes to fix these prompting problems is you go, you change the prompt, and you see how the results are \u2014 and we have a lot of tooling to help you do that at scale. But that\u2019s the core thing: just scientific method,\u201d adds Zoneraich.",

                "text": "When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020 and schools transitioned to online learning, both Joe Titus and Paul Suhr were concerned about how to maintain their children\u2019s activity levels in the absence of mandatory physical education classes and sports.\n\nThe two friends\u2019 solution was Hiveclass, a New York-based edtech platform that hosts online courses for K-12 students to learn about fitness, sports, dance, yoga, nutrition, and mindfulness, among other things. There is also a self-defense course.\n\nEven in a post-pandemic world, the platform is attracting interest owing to a confluence of trends. Kids are becoming increasingly disengaged from P.E. classes in schools, often choosing to skip them entirely. Many students dread P.E. for its highly competitive environment, where bullying occurs often.\n\nAdditionally, parents across the U.S. are struggling to pay youth sports expenses. Titus and Suhr, who bonded over second-grade baseball, want their kids to experience the same enjoyment in sports that they once did, but many of these same experiences are becoming unattainable.\n\n\u201cAs a parent in New York City,\u201d said Titus, \u201cthe inequities of the cost of sports was beyond me. I was my son\u2019s first soccer coach, and the cost of it was just so high. I [wondered], \u2018How does a family that lives in low-income housing afford soccer?\u2019\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Hiveclass\n\nInvestors also recognize the value of online P.E. courses. Hiveclass \u2014 where Titus is CEO and Suhr is chief product officer \u2014 just raised $1.5 million seed funding.\n\nThe funding will be allocated to product development. It will also be used to enhance a teacher portal that\u2019s used by educators who use Hiveclass to increase engagement in their classrooms. Also on the roadmap: new services for students with special needs.\n\nIndeed, instead of offering subscriptions directly to parents, Hiveclass markets its services to public schools and libraries.\n\nThe platform offers a collection of short-form videos that teach children various skills, such as how to dribble a basketball. In addition to the videos, there are quizzes in between clips that require written responses, helping to keep kids focused and engaged.\n\nAccessing that teacher portal on the platform, educators can view all their students and their quiz answers to ensure that everyone is completing their work. (Hiveclass says another selling point is that students can earn P.E credits outside of class.)\n\nHiveclass believes it stands out from other edtech platforms and even educational YouTube channels by emphasizing the P.E. and wellness field. The company claims to align with national standards set forth by SHAPE America, the Society of Health and Physical Educators organization that governs physical education in the U.S. Its closest rival, PLT4M, is also a SHAPE America member.\n\nThe company currently partners with more than 80 educational institutions and has over 13,000 students and teachers on the platform.\n\nHiveclass doesn\u2019t publicly disclose pricing; it says that it\u2019s tailored for each client based on their specific requirements, including student count. But it says it has generated more than $2 million in revenue and hopes to hit an additional $1 million by next month. The outfit is also exploring additional revenue streams, says Titus, including licensing agreements.\n\nThe recent round was led by Spring Mountain Capital. Other investors in the round included Georgetown Angel Investor Network (GAIN), New York State Venture Fund, Rethink Education, and Techstars.\n\nThe funding brings the startup\u2019s total capital raised to over $3 million.",

                "text": "Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 star running back Saquon Barkley has not only become an investor in fintech startup Ramp, he is also the star of the company\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial.\n\nInterestingly, it was Barkley who reached out to Ramp about investing, not the other way around as is so often the case with celebrity endorsements.\n\nBarkley reached out after reading Peter Thiel\u2019s book, \u201cZero to One,\u201d according to Ramp CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman. Barkley chose Ramp after some mutual investor friends gave Ramp \u201cstrong\u201d recommendations, Glyman said.\n\nIn a blog post posted February 6 on Ramp\u2019s website, Barkley is quoted as saying: \u200b\u200b\u200d\u201dTrue partnership requires skin in the game. That\u2019s why I invested in Ramp. I saw firsthand how they\u2019re powering American businesses to cut costs and achieve a higher level of performance. That\u2019s the kind of impact I want to be part of.\u201d\n\nThe 15-second ad \u2014 which features Barkley buried in a mountain of expense reports \u2014 was conceived, shot and finished in seven days, Glyman said.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ramp has built a name for itself in the corporate card and expense management space. It\u2019s branched out into travel, bill pay, and more, and was last valued at $7.65 billion.\n\nAccording to Ramp, Barkley\u2019s investment in the fintech startup marks the NFL star\u2019s largest private technology investment to date. According to PitchBook, he\u2019s also backed crypto startup Monad Labs, fintech and Y Combinator alum Sequin, and beverage company X2 Performance.\n\nThe Super Bowl airs on February 9; the Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

                "text": "TrueFoundry, a startup run by a group of former Meta engineers to help enterprises deploy AI systems at scale, has raised $19 million in fresh investment led by Intel Capital.\n\nWith GenAI\u2019s emergence following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, enterprises of all sizes have looked at ways they could embrace AI. But GenAI relies on large language models to deliver intelligence (read efficiency), demanding significant compute power. Not all enterprises have the advantage of accessing hundreds or thousands of GPUs, making GPU optimization essential. Further, enterprises need to experiment with multiple models to find the best fit for their use case and fine-tune existing models to make AI systems relevant to their operations.\n\nTrueFoundry addresses all this with its software available under a platform-as-a-service model, targeting full-stack data scientists. It provides features such as auto-scaling, proactive maintenance, centralized access controls, and real-time monitoring to simplify end-to-end AI deployments.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by former Meta engineers Nikunj Bajaj and Abhishek Choudhary along with their IIT Kharagpur batchmate Anuraag Gutgutia, TrueFoundry initially offered a cross-cloud native software to speed up machine learning deployments. However, as GenAI became mainstream in 2023, the startup modified its system to support GenAI capabilities.\n\n\u201cEarlier, data scientists would only work with models and experiment with them, but a lot of the deployment was handed over to ML engineers. With our system, what we are enabling is that data scientists themselves can actually build this entire complex system and test it at scale before handing it over to the platform team for final deployments,\u201d Gutgutia said in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe startup provides a software solution called an autopilot system, which uses AI to look at logs and metrics to help scale AI applications by adjusting GPU usage and fixing memory requirements.\n\nUsing the autopilot system, Gutgutia told TechCrunch, one of TrueFoundry\u2019s customers with a small team of two people managed 10 million requests per second.\n\nTrueFoundry Co-Founders Abhishek Choudhary, Anuraag Gutgutia, and Nikunj Bajaj (Left to Right) Image Credits:TrueFoundry\n\nTrueFoundry currently has 30 paid customers worldwide alongside \u201ca lot of\u201d users accessing its open source RAG framework for experimentation. Of these customers, GPU giant Nvidia uses the software to build and deploy agents that optimize its GPU clusters. Med-tech company ResMed also uses TrueFoundry\u2019s offering to develop an internal AI platform. Similarly, Siemens Healthineers, Automation Anywhere, Games24x7, and Whatfix are among the customers.\n\nThe startup has architectured its software using Kubernetes, which makes it multi-cloud ready and compatible with all major cloud platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Azure, among others. Additionally, enterprises can deploy the platform natively on-premise.\n\nEnterprises using TrueFoundry have built and launched their internal AI platforms in two months and achieved their ROI in four months, unlike the industry average of 14 months, Bajaj stated. Gutgutia added that the startup delivered its customers with around 40-50% cost reduction on infrastructure spends, along with a 10\u00d7 deployment speed improvement, no matter whether they are working on an agent, RAG, a complex deep learning model or a fine-tuned model.\n\nCloud vendors have started offering their own software to ease the building and deployment of AI models, such as Amazon\u2019s SageMaker and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex. Nonetheless, Gutgutia told TechCrunch that TrueFoundry\u2019s solution is still pertinent as it helps \u201caccelerate the usage of compute\u201d for cloud providers, speed up the time-to-market for AI apps, and reduce their overall costs.\n\nThe all-equity Series A round saw participation from Eniac Ventures, Peak XV Partners, and Jump Capital, as well as angel investors including Gokul Rajaram, Mohit Aron, and Cyan Banister.\n\nThe startup will utilize the funding to expand the team from 45 members based in India to go-to-market positions in the U.S., including sales, customer success, and product marketing roles. It also plans to invest in partnerships, especially with cloud vendors, and is in the process of getting listed in the key cloud marketplaces, beginning with AWS Marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, TrueFoundry aims to launch its AI agent that will help suggest the right resources and enable auto-scaling, as well as troubleshooting.\n\nWith the fresh funding, TrueFoundry has raised over $21 million in total, including the $2.3 million in its seed round in September 2022 led by Peak XV\u2019s (then Sequoia India) Surge.\n\nThe startup quadrupled its customer base last year and deployed over 1,000 clusters across clients for ML workloads. Gutgutia also told TechCrunch that it is at \u201cnorth of $1.5 million ARR\u201d and is looking to double down this year.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "Fizz, the college social app, is looking for ways to enhance and expand its platform, and a recent new hire is poised to help drive these ambitions. The company has brought on David Vasquez, who previously served as TikTok\u2019s head of creator monetization and a product lead for TikTok Shop, as Fizz\u2019s new head of product.\n\nWith Vasquez\u2019s help, Fizz plans to build out its recommendation system, look at expanding its marketplace beyond peer-to-peer transactions with in-app payments, explore video content further, and open its platform to advertising and brand partnerships.\n\nVasquez came across Fizz through his role as startup adviser and was drawn to the social app because of its focus on authentic, community-based content. He was also impressed by the platform\u2019s high retention rate.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of social media apps that know how to grow really quickly and go viral, but they don\u2019t know how to retain their users,\u201d Vasquez told TechCrunch. \u201cSeeing that Fizz had people that were that engaged gave me a lot of confidence that they were on to something special here.\u201d\n\nVasquez says he\u2019s most excited about helping Fizz build out its recommendation engine, noting that one of the reasons TikTok is so successful is because of its ability to put the right content in front of the right user at the right time. Vasquez wants to help replicate that at Fizz, so the company is looking at ways to enhance recommendations and personalize content for users.\n\n\u201cPersonalization is really important to us, and as we scale our user base, we see trends around different types of topics,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cSo, when we can elevate certain trends, or we can personalize content based on what somebody is engaging with, if you\u2019re engaging a lot with sports content, how can we show you more of that type of content? We definitely want to diversify the content that people talk about and also personalize it to users\u2019 experiences.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Fizz\n\nIn addition, Vasquez plans to focus on expanding Fizz\u2019s recently launched peer-to-peer marketplace using insights he learned from scaling TikTok Shop, specifically around how Gen Z likes to shop. For example, Fizz might integrate payments into its platform and also open its marketplace to brands, he said.\n\n\u201cThe way that users buy products from each other today is purely via DMs,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we could do there. We could think about payments and allowing users to transact on Fizz as well. And so, starting to build in that direction, I think is really interesting for us, too. And then, thinking about brands as well, like, how can we integrate e-commerce brands into the Fizz marketplace such that people not only are buying peer-to-peer products, but maybe they can even buy products from established brands as well.\u201d\n\nFizz is also further exploring video; one of the first changes Vasquez pushed for at Fizz was to increase the maximum length of videos that users could share from 15 seconds to 30 seconds. After doing so, the platform has seen a 350% increase in video content creation on the platform.\n\nThe startup plans to continue to push into video given Gen Z\u2019s interest in the format. For now, Fizz is going to focus on short, engaging content and may expand the maximum limit to a minute at some point in the future.\n\nThe platform is now also open to brand partnerships and is seeing a lot of interest from generative AI companies looking to advertise.\n\nFizz is going into 2025 strong: It has seen a 245% increase in daily posts since the start of the year. The platform has also seen a 61% increase in daily active users (DAUs). Vasquez says some of the growth can be attributed to the uncertainty around TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. And Fizz isn\u2019t the only one: During Snap\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Evan Spiegel said \u201cthe overall environment of uncertainty [around TikTok] is benefiting our business.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021, Fizz is now available at more than 300 colleges and universities and has more than 18 million posts on its platform. The startup has raised $41 million in funding to date.",

                "text": "Supply chains have had a tumultuous few years, beginning in 2020, when COVID-19 upended legacy global supply chains. More recently, the \u201cTikTok-ification\u201d of retail has companies like Shein and Temu creating new products constantly as consumer demands change at the same rapid pace.\n\nPendulum aims to help companies better plan for supply and demand in this new on-demand economy.\n\nPendulum\u2019s software connects all of a company\u2019s fragmented internal data sources, like inventory, procurement, and pricing, into one AI-powered model that is meant to help companies predict and optimize their supply and demand.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Benjamin Fels told TechCrunch that getting supply and demand right helps companies not only improve their margins but also reduce waste. \u201cThe single most powerful thing you can do as a retailer to become more sustainable is absolutely nail supply versus demand,\u201d Fels said. \u201cIf you know everything you make somebody wants, you are going to dramatically decarbonize your operations, and you are going to increase at massive scale your margins.\u201d\n\nFels originally got the idea for Pendulum after he spent years on the derivatives trading floor and oversaw teams building AI-enabled prediction products for supply and demand on the financial side. Fels said he wondered if that same approach would also work for supply and demand in the supply chain world.\n\nHe launched Macro-Eyes in June 2013 alongside Suvrit Sra at MIT to find out. The pair spent years doing research and development around this concept. When the company was ready to commercialize and raise institutional capital in 2023, they rebranded to Pendulum.\n\nPendulum now works with enterprises across retail, healthcare, and national defense. Victoria Secret-owned Adore Me and the U.S. Department of Defense are customers.\n\nPendulum is announcing a $22 million funding round that includes $11 million of non-dilutive capital, for research and development, and $11 million in venture capital from firms including: Lowercarbon Capital, Cross-Border Impact Ventures, and Decisive Point, among others. Fels said the company plans to use the funding to help the company get to scale with a core set of customers, continue to grow its customer base, and improve its product.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9 Image Credits:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9\n\nIn addition to the funding news, Pendulum also announced that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the co-founder of Element AI \u2014 which was acquired by ServiceNow in 2020 for $230 million \u2014 is joining the company as the chief strategy and product officer.\n\n\u201cI realized that JF not only had this insight on bringing AI to the enterprise, but also this rich history across supply chain and across a lot of these fundamental optimization problems,\u201d Fels said. \u201cAfter multiple three-hour-straight conversations, it just clicked that JF needed to lead the product vision, and needed to lead strategy around how we take this to scale.\u201d\n\nSupply chain tech has become a hot category ever since the pandemic highlighted the fragility of existing global supply chains. Fels thinks that Pendulum stands out because its algorithmic approach was built on a decade of research and development.\n\n\u201cPeople have been trying to optimize supply chains for 5,000 years,\u201d Fels said. \u201cOver the last two or three years, the volatility and the uncertainty both around supply and around demand, has just hit every retailer, every organization that\u2019s exposed to supply chain, with tremendous force. We felt that really required a different kind of response.\u201d",

                "text": "When you think about platforms in the construction industry, chances are the concrete slabs designed to support steel beams and tall pillars will come first to your mind. Munich-based startup Comstruct wants to design a different kind of platform for the construction industry \u2014 a software platform.\n\nAt its core, Comstruct is a procurement platform for construction materials. For large-scale projects, processing materials orders can take a lot of time, as materials providers still print out delivery notes and invoices. Orders are often placed over the phone, and it can be difficult to reconcile invoices and create comprehensive data reports.\n\nAnd the startup is announcing a \u20ac12.5 million round ($13 million at current exchange rates) led by GV and 20VC, with existing investors Booom and Puzzle Ventures investing once again.\n\n\u201cToday, the procurement process of materials in construction is very analog. You could place a phone call to order 10 cubic meters next Thursday. Then you get a physical delivery note on the site that is then typed out into an Excel sheet,\u201d Comstruct co-founder and CEO Henric Meinhardt told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd then they\u2019d sometimes send it via post to the headquarters, where they then manually compare invoices to the receipts.\u201d\n\nEach materials supplier could build its own app to process orders, but the problem is that contractors don\u2019t want to deal with 100 different apps to get documents. That\u2019s where Comstruct comes in with its platform that can unify these processes.\n\nComstruct first contacts general contractors to understand how they get their materials, as they generally work with myriad suppliers depending on the location of the construction sites and other specific needs.\n\n\u201cWe approach those material suppliers. We call them and ask them: How can you share the data? Do you have an EDI interface? Do you have an email where you can forward the information? Do you have a customer portal that we can scrape to find materials? And then we structure the information,\u201d Meinhardt said.\n\nThe startup then uses machine learning to integrate each supplier on its platform. \u201cThis technical improvement enabled us to integrate 800 material suppliers over the last two years, which is quite a significant amount already,\u201d Meinhardt said.\n\nOn top of this data layer, Comstruct has built four modules around ordering, digital delivery receipts, invoice reconciliation, and ESG reporting. The startup runs on a usage-based pricing model with a simple per-document pricing strategy.\n\n\u201cWith the [Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive] in Europe, [contractors] need to report how much material went into construction projects. Until now, they didn\u2019t know how much concrete they used [\u2026] that\u2019s a number they didn\u2019t have,\u201d Meinhardt said.\n\nComstruct competes with Kojo in the U.S. and Qflow in the U.K, but each competitor has its own positioning. According to Meinhardt, Kojo \u201cfocuses a lot more on the procurement side,\u201d while Qflow \u201cfocuses a lot on waste management.\u201d\n\nThe company originally started working in Switzerland because Meinhardt studied there. Comstruct claims that it already has good coverage of the materials industry in that country, and it has 70% to 80% of requested suppliers on its platform already.

                "text": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang had an extensive CES 2025 address, detailing everything from Nvidia\u2019s next set of GPUs, its plans for embracing the next era of robotics and automotive innovation, and the launch of its own AI world models.\n\nAnd before he ended his keynote, Huang had one more reveal in store: Project Digits. Nvidia has shrunk down its Grace Blackwell hardware platform to fit into consumer devices, making its research- and data science- oriented chips more accessible to students and researchers. They\u2019ll still have to pay $3,000 for these machines, which are targeted to launch in May from \u201ctop partners.\u201d Nvidia has yet to offer more details, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction for this kind of processing power.\n\nFollow along with the rest of Nvidia\u2019s reveals and our coverage of CES via our liveblog.",

                "text": "Anthropic\u2019s CEO Dario Amodei is worried about competitor DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company that took Silicon Valley by storm with its R1 model. And his concerns could be more serious than the typical ones raised about DeepSeek sending user data back to China.\n\nIn an interview on Jordan Schneider\u2019s ChinaTalk podcast, Amodei said DeepSeek generated rare information about bioweapons in a safety test run by Anthropic.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s performance was \u201cthe worst of basically any model we\u2019d ever tested,\u201d Amodei claimed. \u201cIt had absolutely no blocks whatsoever against generating this information.\u201d\n\nAmodei stated that this was part of evaluations Anthropic routinely runs on various AI models to assess their potential national security risks. His team looks at whether models can generate bioweapons-related information that isn\u2019t easily found on Google or in textbooks. Anthropic positions itself as the AI foundational model provider that takes safety seriously.\n\nAmodei said he didn\u2019t think DeepSeek\u2019s models today are \u201cliterally dangerous\u201d in providing rare and dangerous information but that they might be in the near future. Although he praised DeepSeek\u2019s team as \u201ctalented engineers,\u201d he advised the company to \u201ctake seriously these AI safety considerations.\u201d\n\nAmodei has also supported strong export controls on chips to China, citing concerns that they could give China\u2019s military an edge.\n\nAmodei didn\u2019t clarify in the ChinaTalk interview which DeepSeek model Anthropic tested, nor did he give more technical details about these tests. Anthropic didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment from TechCrunch. Neither did DeepSeek.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise has sparked concerns about its safety elsewhere, too. For example, Cisco security researchers said last week that DeepSeek R1 failed to block any harmful prompts in its safety tests, achieving a 100% jailbreak success rate.\n\nCisco didn\u2019t mention bioweapons but said it was able to get DeepSeek to generate harmful information about cybercrime and other illegal activities. It\u2019s worth mentioning, though, that Meta\u2019s Llama-3.1-405B and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o also had high failure rates of 96% and 86%, respectively.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether safety concerns like these will make a serious dent in DeepSeek\u2019s rapid adoption. Companies like AWS and Microsoft have publicly touted integrating R1 into their cloud platforms \u2014 ironically enough, given that Amazon is Anthropic\u2019s biggest investor.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s a growing list of countries, companies, and especially government organizations like the U.S. Navy and the Pentagon that have started banning DeepSeek.\n\nTime will tell if these efforts catch on or if DeepSeek\u2019s global rise will continue. Either way, Amodei says he does consider DeepSeek a new competitor that\u2019s on the level of the U.S.\u2019s top AI companies.\n\n\u201cThe new fact here is that there\u2019s a new competitor,\u201d he said on ChinaTalk. \u201cIn the big companies that can train AI \u2014 Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, perhaps Meta and xAI \u2014 now DeepSeek is maybe being added to that category.\u201d",

                "text": "This week, Silicon Valley came barrelling into Washington, D.C., in the form of fresh-faced engineers supposedly running the government. A bombshell Wired report said that Elon Musk had quietly selected at least six engineers, the oldest of which is reportedly 24, to help him run his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe secrecy of the group, as well as the inexperience of the identified six, drew ire from the Washington establishment. \u200b\u200b\u201cThe American people will not stand for an unelected secret group to run rampant through the executive branch,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.\n\nBut mostly, it has spawned six new mysteries. Since the engineers are all reportedly under the age of 25, their digital footprints are limited, and, in true Muskian fashion, most have eschewed any media. Musk has even said that publicly naming these men was \u201ca crime,\u201d amounting to doxxing. So the country has been left to wonder who these young people are and what motivates them.\n\nIn late 2023, I spent an hour speaking to one of these newly crowned powerbrokers: Luke Farritor, a then-21-year-old \u201crun-of-the-mill computer science major\u201d at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln working on the Vesuvius Challenge. That\u2019s an effort spearheaded by AI investor Nat Friedman to use AI to decode ancient scrolls. Farritor, a Thiel Fellow, was like many young men in the Peter Thiel-verse: polite (he referred to me as \u201cma\u2019am\u201d), prone to tangents about bygone civilizations, and committed to technology above all.\n\nOur conversation was primarily about the Vesuvius Challenge, so I didn\u2019t ask, say, what methods he would use to dismantle the federal government should he be called upon to do so in the future. But Farritor did emphasize that the project showed him the power of coding \u2014 how technology enabled him to solve a problem that had stumped experts for decades. \u201cEven if you\u2019re just some scrawny kid from Nebraska, you can work hard and make an impact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to help\u201d\n\nWhen Farritor joined SpaceX in early 2023, as an intern working on the Starship launch pad software, he was following in his father\u2019s footsteps. His dad, Shane Farritor, is a professor of mechanical engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-founder of surgical robotics company Virtual Incision. Farritor shared his father\u2019s passion for technology, working long hours to help facilitate Starship launches. \u201cI just worked super hard night and day for all seven months,\u201d Farritor said of his internship, describing it as \u201ca ton of fun.\u201d\n\nOne day on the drive to work, he heard Friedman on Dwarkesh Patel\u2019s podcast, describing the mystery of the Vesuvius scrolls: papyrus documents buried in A.D. 79 by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. The scrolls looked like blocks of charcoal, but Friedman and a handful of professors believed that, with 3D modeling and AI technology, someone could read them. He offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who succeeded.\n\nFarritor had studied Latin and was fascinated by ancient civilizations. \u201cI always read about archaeology growing up, and it\u2019s like, wow, now I get to actually be involved in a project with Richard Janko,\u201d he recalled, referring to the classics scholar who was a judge for the Vesuvius Challenge.\n\nAfter listening to the podcast, Farritor went home to his Texas apartment and started working, creating software that could detect patterns on the charred paper that would correlate to letters. He went as far as making his own test scrolls, buying up papyrus from Amazon and burning it in the oven of his father\u2019s robotics company.\n\nFriedman announced some of the cash prize recipients on a livestream \u2014 right before a Starship launch where Farritor\u2019s job was to check all 60-something computers in Mission Control. \u201cI have this very distinct memory where in my left hand I\u2019m holding this livestream of Nat talking,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then, with my right hand, I\u2019m going from computer to computer, turning on each thing in Mission Control.\u201d\n\nFarritor and his friends would eventually take home the grand prize of $700,000, which Farritor told me he\u2019d use to pay off his parents\u2019 mortgage, \u201cbuy the new iPhone,\u201d and likely put the rest into \u201cstarting a company.\u201d\n\nHis plans back then were a far cry from his current gig, where Wired reports he has a government email and access to the physical office at the General Services Administration.\n\nBut his time at the Vesuvius Challenge did include run-ins with the university establishment. He described the Vesuvius Challenge organizers butting heads with the university bureaucracy as they tried to access certain high-tech scanners. His view as to why the team should get the access they wanted: They were trying to help.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re a bunch of Silicon Valley tech bros, but we\u2019re here to help and kind of build all that goodwill,\u201d he said of the project\u2019s university dealings. \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate balance, right? People are very complicated creatures.\u201d",

                "text": "Andrew Ng, the founder and former leader of Google Brain, supports Google\u2019s recent decision to drop its pledge not to build AI systems for weapons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad that Google has changed its stance,\u201d Ng said during an onstage interview Thursday evening with TechCrunch at the Military Veteran Startup Conference in San Francisco.\n\nEarlier this week, Google deleted a 7-year-old pledge from its AI principles web page, which promised the company would not design AI for weapons or surveillance. Alongside the deletion, Google published a blog post penned by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, who noted companies and governments should work together to build AI that \u201csupports national security.\u201d\n\nGoogle made its AI weapons pledge in 2018 following the Project Maven protests, in which thousands of employees protested the company\u2019s contracts with the U.S. military. The protestors specifically took issue with Google supplying AI for a military program that helped interpret video images and could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.\n\nNg, however, was baffled by the Project Maven protestors, he told an audience largely made up of veterans.\n\n\u201cFrankly, when the Project Maven thing went down \u2026 A lot of you are going out, willing to shed blood for our country to protect us all,\u201d said Ng. \u201cSo how the heck can an American company refuse to help our own service people that are out there, fighting for us?\u201d\n\nNg did not work at Google when the Project Maven protests happened, but he did play a key role in shaping Google\u2019s efforts around AI and neural networks. Today, Ng leads an AI-focused venture studio and AI fund, and speaks out frequently about AI policy.\n\nNg later said he was grateful that two AI regulatory efforts \u2014 the vetoed California SB 1047 bill and Biden\u2019s overturned AI executive order \u2014 were no longer in play. He had repeatedly argued that both measures would slow down open source AI development in America.\n\nThe real key to American AI safety, Ng argued, is to ensure America can compete with China technologically. He noted that AI drones would \u201ccompletely revolutionize the battlefield.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only former Google executive who has spread that message. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt now spends his days lobbying Washington, D.C., to purchase AI drones to compete with China; his company, White Stork, may eventually supply those drones.\n\nWhile Ng and Schmidt seem to support the military\u2019s use of AI, the topic has split the ranks within Google for years.\n\nMeredith Whittaker, now the president of Signal, led the Maven protests in 2018 while working at Google as an AI researcher. When Google made the pledge to not renew its Project Maven contracts, Whittaker said she was happy about the decision, noting the company \u201cshould not be in the business of war.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not the only Googler who\u2019s dissented. Former Google AI researcher and Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton previously called for global governments to prohibit and regulate the use of AI in weapons. Another longtime and revered Google executive, Jeff Dean \u2014 now the chief scientist of DeepMind \u2014 previously signed a letter opposing the use of machine learning in autonomous weapons.\n\nIn recent years, Google and Amazon fell under renewed scrutiny for their military work, including their Project Nimbus contracts with the Israeli government. Employees of both cloud providers staged sit-ins last year to protest Project Nimbus, under which Google and Amazon reportedly provided cloud computing services to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe Pentagon and militaries around the globe have a renewed appetite to use AI, the Department of Defense\u2019s chief AI officer previously told TechCrunch. As Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other tech giants invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, many are looking to recoup that investment through military partnerships.\n\n",

                "text": "An AI system developed by Google DeepMind, Google\u2019s leading AI research lab, appears to have surpassed the average gold medalist in solving geometry problems in an international mathematics competition.\n\nThe system, called AlphaGeometry2, is an improved version of a system, AlphaGeometry, that DeepMind released last January. In a newly published study, the DeepMind researchers behind AlphaGeometry2 claim their AI can solve 84% of all geometry problems over the last 25 years in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a math contest for high school students.\n\nWhy does DeepMind care about a high-school-level math competition? Well, the lab thinks the key to more capable AI might lie in discovering new ways to solve challenging geometry problems \u2014 specifically Euclidean geometry problems.\n\nProving mathematical theorems, or logically explaining why a theorem (e.g. the Pythagorean theorem) is true, requires both reasoning and the ability to choose from a range of possible steps toward a solution. These problem-solving skills could \u2014 if DeepMind\u2019s right \u2014 turn out to be a useful component of future general-purpose AI models.\n\nIndeed, this past summer, DeepMind demoed a system that combined AlphaGeometry2 with AlphaProof, an AI model for formal math reasoning, to solve four out of six problems from the 2024 IMO. In addition to geometry problems, approaches like these could be extended to other areas of math and science \u2014 for example, to aid with complex engineering calculations.\n\nAlphaGeometry2 has several core elements, including a language model from Google\u2019s Gemini family of AI models and a \u201csymbolic engine.\u201d The Gemini model helps the symbolic engine, which uses mathematical rules to infer solutions to problems, arrive at feasible proofs for a given geometry theorem.\n\nA typical geometry problem diagram in an IMO exam. Image Credits:Google (opens in a new window)\n\nOlympiad geometry problems are based on diagrams that need \u201cconstructs\u201d to be added before they can be solved, such as points, lines, or circles. AlphaGeometry2\u2019s Gemini model predicts which constructs might be useful to add to a diagram, which the engine references to make deductions.\n\nBasically, AlphaGeometry2\u2019s Gemini model suggests steps and constructions in a formal mathematical language to the engine, which \u2014 following specific rules \u2014 checks these steps for logical consistency. A search algorithm allows AlphaGeometry2 to conduct multiple searches for solutions in parallel and store possibly useful findings in a common knowledge base.\n\nAlphaGeometry2 considers a problem to be \u201csolved\u201d when it arrives at a proof that combines the Gemini model\u2019s suggestions with the symbolic engine\u2019s known principles.\n\nOwing to the complexities of translating proofs into a format AI can understand, there\u2019s a dearth of usable geometry training data. So DeepMind created its own synthetic data to train AlphaGeometry2\u2019s language model, generating over 300 million theorems and proofs of varying complexity.\n\nThe DeepMind team selected 45 geometry problems from IMO competitions over the past 25 years (from 2000 to 2024), including linear equations and equations that require moving geometric objects around a plane. They then \u201ctranslated\u201d these into a larger set of 50 problems. (For technical reasons, some problems had to be split into two.)\n\nAccording to the paper, AlphaGeometry2 solved 42 out of the 50 problems, clearing the average gold medalist score of 40.9.\n\nGranted, there are limitations. A technical quirk prevents AlphaGeometry2 from solving problems with a variable number of points, nonlinear equations, and inequalities. And AlphaGeometry2 isn\u2019t technically the first AI system to reach gold-medal-level performance in geometry, although it\u2019s the first to achieve it with a problem set of this size.\n\nAlphaGeometry2 also did worse on another set of harder IMO problems. For an added challenge, the DeepMind team selected problems \u2014 29 in total \u2014 that had been nominated for IMO exams by math experts, but that haven\u2019t yet appeared in a competition. AlphaGeometry2 could only solve 20 of these.\n\nStill, the study results are likely to fuel the debate over whether AI systems should be built on symbol manipulation \u2014 that is, manipulating symbols that represent knowledge using rules \u2014 or the ostensibly more brain-like neural networks.\n\nAlphaGeometry2 adopts a hybrid approach: Its Gemini model has a neural network architecture, while its symbolic engine is rules-based.\n\nProponents of neural network techniques argue that intelligent behavior, from speech recognition to image generation, can emerge from nothing more than massive amounts of data and computing. Opposed to symbolic systems, which solve tasks by defining sets of symbol-manipulating rules dedicated to particular jobs, like editing a line in word processor software, neural networks try to solve tasks through statistical approximation and learning from examples.\n\nNeural networks are the cornerstone of powerful AI systems like OpenAI\u2019s o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. But, claim supporters of symbolic AI, they\u2019re not the end-all-be-all; symbolic AI might be better positioned to efficiently encode the world\u2019s knowledge, reason their way through complex scenarios, and \u201cexplain\u201d how they arrived at an answer, these supporters argue.\n\n\u201cIt is striking to see the contrast between continuing, spectacular progress on these kinds of benchmarks, and meanwhile, language models, including more recent ones with \u2018reasoning,\u2019 continuing to struggle with some simple commonsense problems,\u201d Vince Conitzer, a Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor specializing in AI, told TechCrunch. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors, but it illustrates that we still don\u2019t really know what behavior to expect from the next system. These systems are likely to be very impactful, so we urgently need to understand them and the risks they pose much better.\u201d\n\nAlphaGeometry2 perhaps demonstrates that the two approaches \u2014 symbol manipulation and neural networks \u2014 combined are a promising path forward in the search for generalizable AI. Indeed, according to the DeepMind paper, o1, which also has a neural network architecture, couldn\u2019t solve any of the IMO problems that AlphaGeometry2 was able to answer.\n\nThis may not be the case forever. In the paper, the DeepMind team said it found preliminary evidence that AlphaGeometry2\u2019s language model was capable of generating partial solutions to problems without the help of the symbolic engine.\n\n\u201c[The] results support ideas that large language models can be self-sufficient without depending on external tools [like symbolic engines],\u201d the DeepMind team wrote in the paper, \u201cbut until [model] speed is improved and hallucinations are completely resolved, the tools will stay essential for math applications.\u201d",

The move comes a day after workers embraced the digital cutlery to protest the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d resignation offer.\n\nThe emailed offer, titled exactly how Elon Musk titled an email to Twitter employees soon after he purchased the platform, is a bid for government workers to resign their roles while receiving payment through September.\n\nThe proposal has raised the ire of federal workers and labor unions alike. On Wednesday, employees at the Technology Transformation Services division of the GSA reportedly unleashed a torrent of spoon emojis in the chat that accompanied an organization-wide, 600-person video conference with new leader Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer. Some have also taken to adding a spoon to their Slack status as a form of silent protest.",

                "text": "GitHub has announced a slew of updates for Copilot, while also giving a glimpse into a more agentic future for its AI-powered pair programmer.\n\nAmong the notable updates includes a feature called Vision for Copilot, which allows users to attach a screenshot, photo, or diagram to a chat, with Copilot generating the interface, code, and alt text to bring it to life.\n\nSo for example, someone on a marketing team could take a screenshot of a web page and illustrate some changes they want made to that page. Rather than requesting such changes via text prompts, it\u2019s now possible to upload an image and just ask Copilot to implement the changes as indicated in the file.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this has been available as an extension in VS Code since October, with Microsoft confirming in the app\u2019s description that it would eventually be deprecated in favor of a native feature within GitHub Copilot Chat. Previously, it also required the user to have their own API key.\n\nVision for Copilot Image Credits:GitHub\n\nGitHub is also introducing a new feature dubbed \u201cnext edit suggestions\u201d as part of Copilot\u2019s broader code-complete functionality.\n\nBefore now, GitHub Copilot in VS Code\u2019s editor worked from the cursor position, but now it will look at other recent edits to predict what you might want to do next. It\u2019s basically using richer contextual cues to automatically identify and suggest what the next edit should be.\n\nIf the developer wants to accept the suggestions, they can hit the Tab key, or Esc to reject.\n\nGitHub Copilot Next Edit Suggestions Image Credits:GitHub\n\nGitHub\u2019s agentic future\n\nGitHub also debuted Copilot Edits last November, serving as a new way to carry out multi-file edits using natural language prompts. This features is now graduating to general availability, while also packing a new \u201cagent mode\u201d that identifies all the files that are relevant to the changes that a developer is trying to make \u2014 rather than relying on them to manually select the files that the changes should apply to.\n\n\u201cCopilot [now] does more of the work to figure out the intent that you had with your original request, and then tries to solve that,\u201d GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told TechCrunch.\n\nLonger term, the goal is to have such \u201cagent modes\u201d apply to other aspects of Copilot, enabling greater automation across a broader range of interlinked tasks. This is why GitHub has also teased a new initiative it\u2019s calling Project Padawan, which is basically a SWE (software engineering) agent that can independently handle entire tasks under the direction of a developer who assigns issues to Copilot.\n\nDohmke didn\u2019t give any indication when this might be ready for prime time, merely noting that it will be working with partners and the community to improve it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for partners that are also building agents, to integrate into that flow, and for customers to work with us and and give us feedback \u2014 because we know it\u2019s not going to be perfect at this stage,\u201d Dohmke said.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "A clearer picture of Bench\u2019s downfall is emerging thanks to newly released bankruptcy filings.\n\nThe records show that the Canada-based startup, which ironically enough offered cloud accounting software for small businesses, consistently struggled to reach profitability. It burned through $135 million from its founding in 2012 to September 2024.\n\nBy the time of its collapse, Bench was forced to shut down due to a \u201cliquidity crisis,\u201d the records say. Bench had $800,000 left in cash in its Canadian account while a separate account for its U.S. entity had less than $400,000.\n\nBench had been making some progress on cutting its burn in recent years, the filings show. Improving finances was the main mission of Bench\u2019s second CEO, Bench\u2019s former CFO who took over in 2022 and began conducting layoffs, according to former staff.\n\nFor example, Bench lost almost $30 million on $42 million in revenue from March 2022 to March 2023. But Bench cut its losses in half the next fiscal year while growing revenue to $49 million.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t enough improvement to stop Bench\u2019s losses from accumulating. As the company struggled, in June 2024, Bench\u2019s biggest lender, the private National Bank of Canada (NBC), made over $40 million in loans available to Bench, per the filing.\n\nThat gave Bench some time to shop itself around for a sale, the task of its third CEO. And NBC appeared on board: On December 12, 2024 \u2014 just 13 days before Bench\u2019s collapse \u2014 NBC signed a new funding and forbearance agreement with Bench, the filing says, meaning it agreed to temporarily pause or modify the startup\u2019s loan repayment obligations.\n\nThe records don\u2019t specify exactly why Bench shut down just two weeks later. A bank \u2014 possibly NBC \u2014 called in Bench\u2019s venture debt, The Information reported. Newcomer reported that NBC declined to make other concessions as Bench was being shopped around.\n\nNBC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch. NBC is owed $51 million by Bench and this number is continuing to accrue due to interest and other fees, the filing notes.\n\nRegardless, Bench is now on a new path after U.S.-based Employer.com suddenly announced it planned on acquiring the startup just 72 hours after its collapse. That process is based on an agreement that \u201ccontemplates\u201d a closing date of February 28, 2025, per the filing.\n\n\n\nStill, Bench\u2019s bankruptcy offers a window into the dangers of too much debt for startups. And venture debt lenders will play a big role in the fire sales and startup shutdowns that are predicted to continue at a fast clip this year, experts say.",

Discovery (WBD) for what it claimed was a willful circumvention of its IP rights.\n\nAccording to Alcon\u2019s complaint, Musk and WBD asked to use imagery from \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d to promote Tesla\u2019s futuristic concept cars hours before their unveiling on a Warner studio lot. When Alcon wouldn\u2019t agree to provide the rights through WBD, the suit alleges that Tesla, at Musk\u2019s direction, sourced that imagery as raw material to duplicate it using an AI model. No specific AI model is named in the suit (yet).\n\nMusk then showed this allegedly fake \u201cBlade Runner\u201d imagery during the event while talking about the film itself.\n\nAlcon also claims in its complaint that it was never made privy to any of the agreements between Tesla and WBD that would\u2019ve been necessary before Tesla\u2019s presser. The production company\u2019s suit proposes banning Tesla from further distributing the disputed promotional materials, as well as unspecified damages \u2014 although the complaint also notes that infringements under the U.S. Copyright Act can be up to $150,000 per violation, and it provides a further cost estimation that is higher:\n\n\u201cBased on past actual brand affiliation contracts for automotive partners on BR2049 [BladeRunner 2049], Tesla likely would have had to make significant expenditures \u2014 at least in the mid-six-figures (at least $500,000) and possibly into the eight figures ($10 million or more) to obtain a BR2049 brand affiliation with Tesla and the [company\u2019s] cybercab [robotaxi] at market value, if Alcon had even been willing to do it at all,\u201d reads the original complaint filed by Alcon\u2019s legal team. \u201cThe copyright infringements here facilitated allowing Tesla to save this expenditure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "For decades, the U.S. healthcare system has struggled to address the diet-related chronic illnesses affecting nearly half of all adults.\n\nThat changed in recent years with the discovery of Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs that help people lose weight. While insurance covers these medications, doctors frequently require patients to see a nutritionist as part of their treatment plan.\n\n\u201cI would argue that GLP-1 for dietitians is the biggest tailwind that any single provider type in American healthcare has ever seen,\u201d said Noah Kotlove, co-founder and CEO of Berry Street, a nutrition counseling platform that launched two years ago.\n\nBerry Street, which provides registered dietitians with tools for managing an independent practice, just raised a $50 million funding round from investors including Northzone, Sofina, and FJ Labs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown tremendously fast,\u201d Kotlove said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very large market.\u201d\n\nBerry Street is one of several nutrition counseling startups booming because of GLP-1 medications.\n\nFay, a startup that, just like Berry Street, matches independent dieticians with patients, revealed on Wednesday that it has raised a $50 million Series B led by Goldman Sachs at a $500 million valuation. The funding comes just nine months after the company announced its $25 million Series A from General Catalyst and Forerunner Ventures.\n\nNourish, which raised a $35 million Series A last March, is another startup that offers similar services.\n\nKotlove says that the growth in GLP-1 usage is not the only factor driving people to seek nutritional therapy.\n\n\u201cIf you have commercial health insurance, you most likely have really generous coverage to see a dietitian,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t know that nutrition counseling is typically 100% covered by insurance, with $0 out-of-pocket for patients. \u201cIt\u2019s arguably the most under-utilized benefit in all of the American health system,\u201d Kotlove said.\n\nStartups like Berry Street are making it easier for practically anyone covered by health insurance and concerned about how they eat to receive counseling from a registered dietician.\n\nBerry Street allows registered dietitians, many of whom are also employed full-time in clinics, to start their own practices in the evenings or on weekends, which means that patients have more opportunities to use the benefit that they likely didn\u2019t even know existed in the past.\n\nKotlove, a serial entrepreneur whose previous venture was a popular alcohol recovery app, has personally experienced the benefits of nutritional counseling. He says that he has been clinically obese since childhood.\n\n\u201cI tried everything to combat my poor diet,\u201d he said. He was at his heaviest when a doctor recommended seeing a dietician.\n\n\u201cI left that visit thinking, \u2018I know what the healthy foods are and what the unhealthy foods are. I don\u2019t really need a dietitian to tell me that,\u2019\u201d he said. But he still gave nutritional therapy a try.\n\nThen Kotlove was surprised at just how much his sessions with the dietitian helped him. \u201cIt felt a lot like therapy, but instead of talking about my relationship with my family members, or my partner, we were talking about my relationship with food,\u201d he said.\n\nHe ended up losing 60 pounds and keeping that weight off. Another surprise was that all his sessions were entirely covered by insurance.\n\nKotlove\u2019s transformation was the inspiration for Berry Street. He hopes that his company will help many people have similar transformations.",

                "text": "In just a few days, France will host the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, with heads of state flocking to Paris to meet global tech leaders. They\u2019ll most likely announce some big investments and diplomatic agreements focused on safety or the environmental impact of artificial intelligence.\n\nAhead of the summit, early-stage VC firm Galion.exe, growth investment firm Revaia, and advisory firm Chausson Partners teamed up to create the French AI Report, which looks at the current trends in the tech ecosystem.\n\nWhile all eyes are currently on the U.S. and China with OpenAI looking to raise tens of billions of dollars and DeepSeek capturing everyone\u2019s attention, there has been a boom in AI startups in Europe, too. In 2024 alone, AI companies represented around 20% of all VC funding in the region.\n\nIn total, that represents around $8 billion in funding for AI startups in 2024. That metric is most likely going to grow rapidly, as AI startups are still relatively young. Seventy percent of the capital raised by AI startups in 2024 was for a seed to Series B round.\n\nImage Credits:French AI Report (screenshot)\n\nEuropean countries that tend to attract VC funding in general have also become the main AI investment hubs, with the U.K. leading the group, France and Germany following suit, and the Nordics punching above its demographic weight. Here\u2019s the breakdown from 2020 to 2024:\n\nImage Credits:French AI Report (screenshot)\n\nInterestingly, as AI companies become bigger, they tend to attract international investors, with U.S. VC firms accounting for around 50% of money invested in AI companies at the Series C round and later.\n\nIn France more specifically, there are \u201cmore than 750 startups that have created 35,000 jobs and operate in all areas that are transforming today\u2019s society,\u201d minister delegate for artificial intelligence and digital technologies Clara Chappaz said at a press conference.\n\nShe also mentioned that there are 2,000 scientists focused on AI research and 600 doctorate students working on artificial intelligence. And you may have noticed that there are quite a few French engineers and researchers working for AI companies in the U.S., too.\n\nThe team behind the French AI Report looked more closely at the top 400 AI startups in France and tried to identify the rising stars. While Mistral AI and Poolside are already some familiar names for readers who have followed the AI industry, the vast majority of AI startups aren\u2019t working on the next foundation model.\n\nOn the infrastructure front, some companies are optimizing the data workflows and pipelines, such as Linkup and Kestra, or improving inference performance, such as ZML, or developing agents that can sift through large datasets and improve productivity. Dust is a good example of that.\n\nImage Credits:French AI Report (screenshot)\n\nBut the reality is that most AI startups in France are focusing on applications for specific verticals. Based on this report, two important areas for AI startups in France are health and climate.\n\nOwkin and its spinoff biotech company Bioptimus have been leading the pack on the health tech front, but it\u2019s a surprisingly diverse group of companies with three big areas of interest: imaging tools, drug discovery, and medical treatment improvement.\n\nImage Credits:French AI Report (screenshot)\n\nSimilarly, while a large chunk of the AI industry is focused on productivity gains for office workers, artificial intelligence is also actively being used to build the next generation of climate startups. In addition to agtech, carbon and energy management \u2014 two topics that are related \u2014 seem to be a big focus. There are also a handful of promising new materials companies that are emerging (Altrove, for instance).\n\nImage Credits:French AI Report (screenshot)\n\nAll the companies included in the list can be found here. You\u2019ll also find plenty of AI companies working on one job function \u2014 sales, customer care, HR or legal \u2014 and using AI to simplify the most common tasks.\n\nOf course, some companies aren\u2019t going to be there in five years. But many of them are currently growing at a rapid pace. We\u2019re still at the beginning of the AI revolution, and though it\u2019s easy to think about the AI industry as a zero-sum game with one country or one company \u201cwinning\u201d over the others, it seems like the AI boom is more distributed than expected.",

                "text": "On a clear spring evening in Michigan, the stars aligned \u2014 just not in the way Upfront Ventures partner Nick Kim expected.\n\nHe\u2019d just led a $9.5 million seed round for OurSky, a software platform for space observational data, and was eager to see what its telescope partner PlaneWave Instruments could do.\n\nBut when they rolled out the telescopes that night at PlaneWave\u2019s manufacturing facility, he was stuck waiting.\n\n\u201cIt took them quite a long time to get the first image. I\u2019m talking like, multiple hours. And these are the people who make the telescopes! They were using all this, like, off-the-shelf, open source software that they kind of cobbled together,\u201d Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nKim wasn\u2019t upset, though. He was excited. \u201cThis is why OurSky needed to exist, right? This is the problem,\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cWhat a perfect match.\u201d\n\nIt was such a good match that, now, OurSky and PlaneWave are merging to create a new company called Observable Space.\n\nOurSky founder Dan Roelker and PlaneWave founder Richard Hedrick say this will make the telescopes easier to use. And they also believe the tighter integration will open up new markets \u2014 especially as they leverage their position as the only U.S.-based telescope manufacturer. They already count NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and Georgia State University\u2019s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy as customers.\n\n\u201cMy dream was to integrate all the components on the telescope, even the parts we don\u2019t sell, and then integrate the control of the telescope,\u201d Hedrick said in an interview. \u201cIt was very obvious for us to be working together.\u201d\n\nRoelker, who was SpaceX\u2019s VP of software engineering from 2015 to 2019, said telescope users have to deal with what he called a \u201cmash of integration bullsh\u2013.\u201d PlaneWave\u2019s vertical strategy combined with OurSky\u2019s software will eliminate those headaches, he said.\n\nSolving that integration problem is an opportunity for Observable Space to grow the market, Roelker said. (The platform OurSky has built will continue on in that name, and the telescopes will continue to be sold under the PlaneWave brand.)\n\nThat can involve a number of things, like letting users tap multiple telescopes at a single site \u2014 or even around the world \u2014 to mimic the capabilities of a much larger telescope, or sending communications to and from space via laser, all while lowering cost.\n\nSqueezing more out of his high-quality telescopes sold Hedrick on the merger. It will make the tech more approachable and affordable for enthusiasts and institutions alike.\n\nHedrick said one of those institutions recently designed some one-meter telescopes and had them custom-built by someone else. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018God, if you had existed, we never would have done that,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nNew business\n\nAs the cost to get to orbit shrinks, more companies are sending things to space, Roelker said. That means there is increased demand for the ability to locate and track objects orbiting the Earth, communicate with spacecraft, and enable defense and intelligence applications.\n\nObservable Space can be a key player in that new economy, according to Mislav Tolusic, managing partner at dual-use venture fund Marlinspike, which has invested in Observable Space.\n\n\u201cEvery day you\u2019re relying on space,\u201d Tolusic said in an interview. \u201cIf you take out GPS constellations, we\u2019re in trouble economically. It\u2019s a big, big, big deal. A lot of systems stop functioning. And guess what? The future is going to be even more dependent on that infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTolusic praised PlaneWave\u2019s quality, and noted Hedrick built up the company at a time when basically all telescope manufacturing is overseas \u2014 which he believes is an advantage.\n\n\u201cIf you want to replicate that [in the U.S.], you have to go figure out how to make those fine lenses, how to make gimbals \u2014 and not just how to design them but how to spit them out by the thousands,\u201d he said.\n\nJordan Noone, general partner at Embedded Ventures, explained his fund\u2019s investment with a specific example of what OurSky and PlaneWave can do as a combined company.\n\nShortly before the merger, Noone was at Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles for a demo of the companies\u2019 products working together.\n\nHe told TechCrunch that the teams pulled an observation request from the queue on OurSky\u2019s platform: a satellite operator had lost radio contact with its spacecraft. The OurSky and PlaneWave teams located it quickly.\n\nWhat he described was a much smoother experience than Kim\u2019s demo in Michigan, and served as proof in his mind that Observable Space was a good bet to make.\n\n\u201cMany of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, like Apple, Nvidia \u2014 they\u2019re hardware/software platform combos,\u201d Noone said. \u201cCompanies that approach just one of those two can have a lot of inherent value, but the combination of both in today\u2019s world is extremely powerful.\u201d\n\nStar Wars or Star Trek?\n\nObservable Space has about 100 employees, with the manufacturing operations remaining in Michigan, some engineering happening in Los Angeles, California, and an observatory outside Washington, D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s already revenue-generating, and the combined company has raised $11 million to date, including funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s nonprofit strategic investment arm.\n\nHedrick and Roelker said the two companies have fit together easily, since they were both focused on such different businesses and didn\u2019t have massive back-office operations.\n\n\u201cGoing through the merger process itself was actually really valuable, because when you\u2019re going through it, a lot of issues pop up,\u201d Roelker said. \u201cYou actually get a really good sense of how you\u2019re going to work together. And I think both Rick and I felt really good about that, because we actually went through some really hard things during the merger.\u201d\n\nWhen asked, the pair did not describe those \u201chard things,\u201d and Hedrick instead quipped: \u201cWe had to decide on whether [the company] was going to be Star Wars or Star Trek.\u201d\n\nThe answer?\n\n\u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d Roelker said.",

                "text": "Swiss startup LogicStar is bent on joining the AI agent game. The summer 2024-founded startup has bagged $3 million in pre-seed funding to bring tools to the developer market that can do autonomous maintenance of software applications, rather than the more typical AI agent use case of code co-development.\n\nLogicStar CEO and co-founder Boris Paskalev (pictured top right, in the feature image, with his fellow co-founders) suggests the startup\u2019s AI agents could end up partnering with code development agents \u2014 such as, say, the likes of Cognition AI\u2019s Devin \u2014 in a business win-win.\n\nCode fidelity is an issue for AI agents building and deploying software, just as it is for human developers, and LogicStar wants to do its bit to grease the development wheel by automatically picking up and fixing bugs wherever they may crop up in deployed code.\n\nAs it stands, Paskalev suggests that \u201ceven the best models and agents\u201d out there are unable to resolve the majority of bugs they\u2019re presented with \u2014 hence the team spying an opportunity for an AI startup that\u2019s dedicated to improving these odds and delivering on the dream of less tedious app maintenance.\n\nTo this end, they are building atop large language models (LLMs) \u2014 such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT or even China\u2019s DeepSeek \u2014 taking a model-agnostic approach for their platform. This allows LogicStar to dip into different LLMs and maximize its AI agents\u2019 utility, based on which foundational model works best for resolving a particular code issue.\n\nPaskalev contends that the founding team has the technical and domain-specific knowledge to build a platform that can resolve programming problems which can challenge or outfox LLMs working alone. They also have past entrepreneurial success to point to: He sold his prior code review startup, DeepCode, to cybersecurity giant Snyk back in September 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning we were thinking about actually building a large language model for code,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThen we realized that that will quickly become a commodity\u2026 Now we\u2019re building assuming all those large language models are there. Assuming there\u2019s some actually decent [AI] agents for code, how do we extract the maximum business value from them?\u201d\n\nHe said that the idea built on the team\u2019s understanding of how to analyze software applications. \u201cCombine that with large language models \u2014 then focus into grounding and verifying what those large language models and the AI agent actually suggest.\u201d\n\nTest-driven development\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? Paskalev says LogicStar performs an analysis of each application that its tech is deployed on \u2014 using \u201cclassical computer science methods\u201d \u2014 in order to build a \u201cknowledge base.\u201d This gives its AI agent a comprehensive map of the software\u2019s inputs and outputs; how variables link to functions; and any other linkages and dependencies, etc.\n\nThen, for every bug it\u2019s presented with, the AI agent is able to determine which parts of the application are impacted \u2014 allowing LogicStar to narrow down the functions needing to be simulated in order to test scores of potential fixes.\n\nPer Paskalev, this \u201cminimized execution environment\u201d allows the AI agent to run \u201cthousands\u201d of tests aimed at reproducing bugs to identify a \u201cfailing test,\u201d and \u2014 through this \u201ctest-driven development\u201d approach \u2014 ultimately land on a fix that sticks.\n\nHe confirms that the actual bug fixes are sourced from the LLMs. But because LogicStar\u2019s platform enables this \u201cvery fast executive environment\u201d its AI agents can work at scale to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, and serve its users with a shortcut to the best that LLMs can offer.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is [LLMs are] great for prototyping, testing things, etc., but it\u2019s absolutely not great for [code] production, commercial applications. I think we\u2019re far from there, and this is what our platform delivers,\u201d he argued. \u201cTo be able to extract those capabilities of the models today, we can actually safely extract commercial value and actually save time for developers to really focus on the important stuff.\u201d\n\nEnterprises are set to be LogicStar\u2019s initial target. Its \u201csilicon agents\u201d are intended to be put to work alongside corporate dev teams, albeit at a fraction of the salary required to hire a human developer, handling a range of app upkeep tasks and freeing up engineering talent for more creative and/or challenging work. (Or, well, at least until LLMs and AI agents get a lot more capable.)\n\nWhile the startup\u2019s pitch touts a \u201cfully autonomous\u201d app maintenance capability, Paskalev confirms that the platform will allow human developers to review (and otherwise oversee) the fixes its AI agents call up. So trust can be \u2014 and must be \u2014 earned first.\n\n\u201cThe accuracy that a human developer delivers ranges between 80 to 90%. Our goal [for our AI agents] is to be exactly there,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for LogicStar: An alpha version of its technology is in testing with a number of undisclosed companies which Paskalev refers to as \u201cdesign partners.\u201d Currently the tech only supports Python \u2014 but expansions to TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java are billed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main goal [with the pre-seed funding] is to actually show the technology works with our design partners \u2014 focusing on Python,\u201d adds Paskalev. \u201cWe already spent a year on it, and we have lots of opportunity to actually expand. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to focus it first, to show the value in one case.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s pre-seed raise was led by European VC firm Northzone, with angel investors from DeepMind, Fleet, Sequoia scouts, Snyk, and Spotify also joining the round.\n\nIn a statement, Michiel Kotting, partner at Northzone, said: \u201cAI-driven code generation is still in its early stages, but the productivity gains we\u2019re already seeing are revolutionary. The potential for this technology to streamline development processes, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation is immense. and the team\u2019s vast technical expertise and proven track record position them to deliver real, impactful results. The future of software development is being reshaped, and LogicStar will play a crucial role in software maintenance.\u201d\n\nLogicStar is operating a waiting list for potential customers wanting to express interest in getting early access. It told us a beta release is planned for later this year.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

                "text": "An estimated 20% to 30% of all inventory in the U.S. is surplus, with much of it ending up in landfills. A startup called Sotira wants to help address this problem: It leverages AI to help companies offload and monetize their surplus inventory. Sotira partners with brands to offload millions of pounds of surplus grocery, health and wellness, and cosmetics goods all over the United States.\n\nTo fuel its mission, the company has closed a $2 million pre-seed funding round. Sotira plans to use the new funding to expand its operations nationally, specifically in the Midwest and southeast.\n\nThe startup, which exhibited at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200 2024, was founded by CEO Amrita Bhasin and CTO Gary Kwong. The pair met at UC Berkeley and bonded over their shared interest in the e-commerce and logistics space. Bhasin and Kwong were both running their own companies that were focused on selling previously owned, new, or used products.\n\nThe duo then started running a liquidation business together because they wanted to understand how the space operated before jumping into starting a company. They decided to cast a wide net before zeroing in on their mission with Sotira.\n\n\u201cWe learned that the market opportunity for monetizing overstock is huge,\u201d Bhasin told TechCrunch. \u201cIt is a multibillion-dollar market, and it is a very old-school manual space, like the people we\u2019re talking to are doing things on pen and paper. They\u2019ve never heard of ChatGPT, they don\u2019t know what AI is. And so that pretty much was the catalyst for us starting the company. We were like, there is a market opportunity here.\u201d\n\nSotira helps to offload products that are nearing their expiration date, items that are facing storage capacity issues, and products that have been over-ordered. Vetted suppliers can sign up for Sotira and link their storage capacity or inventory. Sotira then matches the products to a buyer that will then pick up pallets from the supplier\u2019s warehouse.\n\nBuyers are verified, brick-and-mortar stores all over the country. They can share the UPC codes of the kind of inventory they purchase, and Sotira will use AI to match them with inventory. Sotira automates compliance and facilitates transactions and logistics with buyers so suppliers get paid upon pickup. Sotira\u2019s goal is to clear surplus within a few days of receiving inventory data.\n\nIn the past, brands would have had to identify the stock they would not be able to sell to their primary purchasers, and then call up different liquidators to compare offers and manually negotiate prices. Sotira has brought this process online and allows suppliers to clear up inventory much faster.\n\nSotira charges a monthly fee for access; it also takes a percentage of revenue from each transaction on its platform.\n\nWhile Sotira is beneficial for suppliers and buyers, Bhasin says Sotira is also proud of its ability to open up affordable access to premium products that people may otherwise be unable to access. For instance, Sotira works with a lot of CPG beverage brands that end up offloading their excess inventory to discount grocery stores.\n\n\u201cIn the economy right now, where you currently look at how rapidly grocery prices are increasing, these are the categories consumers purchase the most,\u201d Bhasin said. \u201cThere is so much value in opening affordable access to these items. A lot of the buyers we work with are in rural areas. They\u2019re in areas that they may be more impoverished, where consumers actually rely on purchasing from over-stock stores, like they won\u2019t purchase from a Whole Foods, they\u2019re purchasing from a discount grocery store.\u201d\n\nBhasin also noted that since California has passed legislation to stop grocery stores from dumping food and beverages, Sotira can now approach these companies and inform them that there\u2019s a market for their surplus inventory.\n\nSotira plans to expand beyond food, beverage, health, and cosmetics in the future and move into the apparel space. The company is getting interest from brands that want help moving their excess clothing and shoes, Bhasin said.\n\nSotira\u2019s pre-seed funding included participation from Unusual Ventures, Night Capital, K5 Global, Ritual Capital, and others.",

                "text": "The fashion industry has concerned Emily Gittins since adolescence.\n\nThe sector is, after all, one of the most polluting in the world. According to some sources, it is responsible for nearly 10% of the earth\u2019s CO 2 emissions and more than 20% of all water waste.\n\nYet people still want more, fast.\n\n\u201cThe way we consume today is hugely problematic,\u201d Gittins told TechCrunch.\n\nIn 2021, Gittins teamed up with Ryan Rowe to launch Archive, a company that provides software to fashion brands and merchants so they can create resale platforms tailored to each business\u2019 wants and needs, including a spot where people can sell used clothes to each other.\n\nCompetitors include Trove and Treet, which also creates online resale software for brands to sell used items. Archive says its product is different because it can support global brands across various continents.\n\nArchive\u2019s features include smart pricing and product feeds, as well as warehouse management to handle intake, processing, repair, and fulfillment; it also provides tools to analyze profits and costs, and allows brands to connect it to their own tools and share data. Archive already works with more than 50 brands, including New Balance, The North Face, and Oscar de la Renta, Gittins says.\n\nThere is a massive opportunity in the general secondhand market, which is expected to hit $73 billion by 2028 in the U.S. alone, according to a resale report by retailer ThreadUp. That share of the fashion industry is only expected to increase, as the Guardian reported, especially among young people and anyone else looking for more eco- and budget-friendly options.\n\nThat\u2019s what convinced VCs to invest a $30 million Series B, led by Energize Capital. Other investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, G9 Ventures, and Bain Capital Ventures. Archive has raised $54 million in total funding to date. Archive will use the new funding to further develop its resale software and more product innovation.\n\nAnother good sign for the clothing resale industry is growing legislation in a number of states that encourages it, like California\u2019s new Responsible Textile Recovery Act, and well as similar legislation in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve debunked the concern that resale cannibalizes full-price sales,\u201d Gittins added. \u201cWe\u2019re in scaling mode with many of our brands and are excited to be launching resale businesses for so many new brands in 2025.\u201d\n\nThis piece was updated to clarify Bain Capital Ventures invested in Archive.",

                "text": "Chinese e-commerce and fast fashion giant Shein is facing fresh scrutiny in the European Union in relation to consumer protection rules following the launch of a coordinated action by the bloc\u2019s Consumer Protection Cooperation Network (CPCN).\n\nThe action is being conducted with reference to the EU\u2019s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, Consumer Rights Directive, Unfair Contracts Terms Directive, Price Indication Directive, and e-commerce Directive \u2014 although it\u2019s not clear what specific concerns the Network has about Shein\u2019s marketplace.\n\nThe move was announced Wednesday by the European Commission as it simultaneously presented a package of measures and reforms aimed at tackling a slew of risks attached to a surge in low-value e-commerce activity in recent years.\n\nDuring a press conference announcing a Communication on e-commerce, EU lawmakers warned that a \u201ctsunami\u201d of cheap imports were flooding the market with products that fail to meet the bloc\u2019s standards \u2014 creating health and safety risks for European consumers.\n\nUnsafe products such as toys with small detachable parts that could pose a choking risk, electrical appliances with inadequate insulation, and chemicals in clothing were cited as examples of hazards linked to cheap imports.\n\n\u201cRecent evidence and findings of tests carried out by national authorities and consumer organizations leave us in no doubt \u2014 the evidence here is clear \u2014 up to 96% of products tested and sold on these platforms are not fully compliant with our rules and our safety standards,\u201d said rule-of-law commissioner Michael McGrath.\n\nThe EU says some 4.6 billion \u201clow-value consignments\u201d (meaning goods with a value not exceeding \u20ac150) entered the market \u2014 equivalent to 12 million parcels per day \u2014 which is twice as many as in 2023 and 3x 2022.\n\nThe boom in ultra-low cost e-commerce is also raising environmental and competition concerns in the EU.\n\nLawmakers said the bundle of issues involved necessitates a multipronged approach which both seeks to make use of a full range of existing laws in relevant areas \u2014 such as the EU\u2019s Digital Services and Digital Markets Act, its General Product Safety Regulation, and Ecodesign rules \u2014 while also pushing for legislative reforms and additional rules in other areas, such as related to custom duties.\n\nSafe and sustainable e-commerce\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Communication sets out what\u2019s being couched as a \u201cA Comprehensive EU Toolbox for Safe and Sustainable E-commerce,\u201d with the proposal spanning big ticket issues like custom reforms and targeted measures for imported goods, as well as calling for consumer protection and competition enforcement to be stepped up in this area.\n\nOn consumer protection, it\u2019s worth noting that while the Commission plays a coordinating role in the CPCN, actual enforcement of laws in this area falls to Member State-level authorities \u2014 so there is only so much centralized action the EU itself can do here. Hence, its loud and public call for action.\n\nThe Communication also urges adoption of the first action plan on the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, to help respond to environmental challenges posed by the surge in e-commerce, as well as pushing for its EU co-legislators to get behind a proposed amendment to the Waste Framework Directive \u2014 which focuses on dealing with textile waste.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Commission also trailed a plan to present a \u201cdigital fairness act\u201d \u2014 which McGrath said would aim to \u201creinforce consumer protection in the digital sphere in a targeted manner.\u201d\n\nThe EU has already taken some actions in this area \u2014 sending request for information to Shein and another low-cost e-commerce platform Temu last June, under the Digital Services Act (DSA), after the two platforms became subject to centralized EU oversight following their designations as very large online platforms (VLOPs). (While, also like Shein, Temu is the target of consumer protection concerns: back in May consumer groups filed a series of coordinated complaints against it, accusing it of breaching the DSA.)\n\nSince March 2024, the Commission has also had an open DSA investigation into online marketplace, AliExpress, another importer of cheap goods into the bloc. And since starting to operate the online governance framework the EU has identified e-commerce as one of its enforcement priorities \u2014 which EVP Henna Virkkunen reiterated that today.\n\n\u201cWe will prioritize and intensify also the Commission supervisory and enforcement of the rules applicable to online marketplaces under the Digital Services Act, including the obligation to assess the risks their service poses to consumers and the measures they take to mitigate these risks,\u201d Virkkunen said during the press briefing.\n\nCustoms reform\n\nOn reform of the EU\u2019s customs union, the bloc has had a proposal on the table since 2023 \u2014 which would eliminate the duty relief currently granted to packages with contents worth less than \u20ac150.\n\nDuring today\u2019s briefing, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, said the proposal anticipated needs related to surging uptake of e-commerce and contained \u201ccritical measures\u201d requiring online platforms to assume more responsibility as importers.\n\n\u201cThe current practice of treating citizens as importers for customs purposes is ineffective in ensuring their protection,\u201d he warned, also stressing the need for \u201cenhancing control capacities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response to the surge of low-value e-commerce imports, it is critical to finalize our customs union reform and possibly front load it to 2026,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Commission is suggesting Member States get behind \u201cpossible complementary measures,\u201d such as a non-discriminatory handling fee for goods delivered directly to consumers. Other actions it\u2019s floating in this area include launching a \u201ccustoms priority control area\u201d dedicated to e-commerce goods; and launching coordinated actions that aim to speedily identify and remove dangerous goods, such as product safety sweeps.\n\n\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d conceded the Communication represents a \u201ccall to action,\u201d urging EU legislators and other stakeholders to \u201cwork collectively \u2026 to ensure that every citizen benefits from a trusted online marketplace.\u201d\n\nResponding to the Commission proposal, BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation, pushed for \u201curgent and ambitious action.\u201d \u201cConsumer groups\u2019 tests show that plenty of products sold online such as toys and textiles are unsafe. If the EU is serious about protecting consumers and hitting the road to decarbonisation, it must ensure everybody plays by the same rules,\u201d said its DG, Agust\u00edn Reyna, in a statement.\n\n\u201cConsumer groups fully support the European Commission and national authorities launching enforcement actions, like the ongoing one we launched against Temu and the one announced today against Shein,\u201d he added.\n\nShein was contacted for comment on the CPCN action. Spokesman Jakub Hera Adamowicz emailed a statement in which the company wrote: \u201cWe share the CPC Network\u2019s goal of ensuring European consumers can shop online with peace of mind, and we intend to work closely with the CPC Network and the Commission to address any concerns.\u201d\n\nIn wider remarks responding to the Commission\u2019s proposed toolbox for safe and sustainable e-commerce, Shein wrote that it welcomes \u201cefforts that enhance trust and safety for European consumers when shopping online,\u201d and also voiced support for \u201ca level competitive playing field.\u201d\n\n\u201cShein\u2019s on-demand model aims to reduce inefficiency and lowers waste on material and unsold inventory, allowing us to offer great style and quality at accessible prices,\u201d it also said, adding: \u201cOur regulatory and compliance teams across the EU will engage our partners at EU and national government-level to study these recommendations and examine how Shein can play our part in strengthening our industry to enhance the online shopping experience for European consumers.\u201d",

                "text": "DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company, is raising the ire of regulators around the world. DeepSeek\u2019s viral AI models and chatbot apps have been banned by a growing number of countries and government bodies, which have expressed concerns over DeepSeek\u2019s ethics, privacy, and security practices.\n\nCorporations have banned DeepSeek, too \u2014 by the hundreds. The biggest worry reportedly is potential data leakage to the Chinese government. According to DeepSeek\u2019s privacy policy, the company stores all user data in China, where local laws mandate organizations to share data with intelligence officials upon request.\n\nAs the list of regions where DeepSeek\u2019s apps are no longer available grows, we\u2019ll continue updating this roundup. Also included: the public sector departments that have prohibited DeepSeek tech.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly became one of the first countries to ban DeepSeek following an investigation by the country\u2019s privacy watchdog into DeepSeek\u2019s handling of personal data.\n\nIn late January, Italy\u2019s Data Protection Authority (DPA) launched an investigation into DeepSeek\u2019s data collection practices and compliance with the GDPR, the EU law that governs how personal data is retained and processed in EU territories. The DPA gave DeepSeek 20 days to respond to questions about how and where the company stores user data and what it uses this data for.\n\nDeepSeek claimed its apps didn\u2019t fall under the jurisdiction of EU law. Italy\u2019s DPA disagreed and took steps to remove DeepSeek\u2019s apps from the Apple and Google app stores in Italy.\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Digital Affairs said that DeepSeek \u201cendangers national information security\u201d and has banned government agencies from using the company\u2019s AI.\n\nIn a statement, the Taiwan ministry said that public sector workers and critical infrastructure facilities run the risk of \u201ccross-border transmission and information leakage\u201d by using DeepSeek\u2019s technology. The Taiwanese government\u2019s ban applies to employees of government agencies as well as public schools and state-owned enterprises.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek AI service is a Chinese product,\u201d the Ministry of Digital Affairs\u2019 statement reads. \u201cIts operation involves [several] information security concerns.\u201d\n\nU.S. Congress\n\nU.S. congressional offices have reportedly been warned not to use DeepSeek tech.\n\nThe House\u2019s chief administrative officer (CAO), which provides support services and business solutions to the House of Representatives, sent a notice to congressional offices indicating that DeepSeek\u2019s technology is \u201cunder review,\u201d Axios reported.\n\n\u201c[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,\u201d the notice said. \u201cTo mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek\u2019s functionality on all House-issued devices.\u201d\n\nAccording to Axios, the CAO has prohibited staffers from installing DeepSeek applications on any official smartphones, computers, or tablets.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an order banning software from DeepSeek and other Chinese companies from government-issued devices in the state.\n\nIn a statement, Abbott said that Texas \u201cwill not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state\u2019s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps. Texas will continue to protect and defend our state from hostile foreign actors.\u201d\n\nU.S. Navy\n\nThe U.S. Navy has instructed its members not to use DeepSeek apps or technology, according to CNBC.\n\nIn late January, the Navy sent an email prohibiting service members from using DeepSeek products \u201cin any capacity\u201d due to \u201cpotential security and ethical concerns associated with the [tech\u2019s] origin[s] and usage.\u201d A Navy spokesperson told CNBC the email was in reference to the Department of the Navy\u2019s chief information officer\u2019s generative AI policy and based on an advisory from the Navy\u2019s cyber workforce manager.\n\nIn the email, the Navy said it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d that members don\u2019t use DeepSeek\u2019s AI \u201cfor any work-related tasks or personal use,\u201d and \u201crefrain from downloading, installing, or using [DeepSeek AI].\u201d\n\nPentagon\n\nThe Pentagon has blocked access to DeepSeek technologies, but not before some staff accessed them, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe Defense Information Systems Agency, which is responsible for the Pentagon\u2019s IT networks, moved to ban DeepSeek\u2019s website in January, according to Bloomberg. The decision is said to have come after defense officials raised concerns that Pentagon workers were using DeepSeek\u2019s applications without authorization.\n\nBloomberg notes that while the prohibition remains in place, Defense Department personnel can use DeepSeek\u2019s AI through Ask Sage, an authorized platform that doesn\u2019t directly connect to Chinese servers.\n\nNASA\n\nNASA has also banned employees from using DeepSeek tech. That\u2019s according to CNBC, which obtained a memo from the agency\u2019s chief AI officer informing personnel that DeepSeek\u2019s servers operate outside the U.S., raising national security concerns.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek and its products and services are not authorized for use with NASA\u2019s data and information or on government-issued devices and networks,\u201d the memo said, per CNBC. \u201c[Employees are not authorized to] access DeepSeek via NASA devices and agency-managed network connections.\u201d\n\nNASA has blocked use of DeepSeek apps on \u201cagency-managed devices and networks,\u201d CNBC reports.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "Startups and big tech companies have aggressively used AI to help developers write code or learn programming better. People have used chatbots to prepare for different scenarios in life, like interviews. Tech assessment platform CodeSignal, which introduced a learning platform for technical subjects with AI assistants last year, launched soft skill courses on its platform today to practice different professional skills and work-life scenarios.\n\nThe company thinks that historically, only the top brass of different organizations could afford to hire an expensive executive coach to skill up in areas of leadership and communication. Using different AI models, CodeSignal has created a practice and learning stack to make the skills and knowledge of a coach available to the masses.\n\nTigran Sloyan, CEO of CodeSignal said that companies hire non-technical people in large numbers. So, it saw an opportunity to train those folks in different areas of their professional life.\n\n\u201cWith the advancement of generative AI, we saw the opportunity to unlock a whole new world of soft skills, including leadership training, sales training, and learning negotiation tactics. We believe that hands-on training is the best way to learn a skill, and that is why after introducing technical training, we are looking at this new area,\u201d Sloyan said.\n\nCodeSignal has launched more than 100 courses on its platform, with topics covering areas like effectively running one-on-one meetings, strategic leadership assessment, behavioral profile assessment, sales skills assessment, and improving public speaking.\n\nUsers can select any of these courses or ask the AI assistant to find them and start practicing different scenarios based on the description. You can use voice to talk to the AI character in the simulation. The company has developed its own voice stack for this instead of using an off-the-shelf solution like ElevenLabs\u2019 conversational agent platform as it thought developing the solution in-house will save costs long-term. Once your conversation is over, the AI assistant gives you tips about your chat, and helps you with areas of improvement.\n\nImage Credits:CodeSignal\n\nEach time you ask for the help of the assistant to give you feedback, you lose an energy bar from an energy meter. Free users \u2014 which represent 90% of the chunk \u2014 get only a limited energy bar per day. Users can unlock unlimited chat with the AI assistant by paying a fee of $24.99.\n\nWhen people complete practices and courses successfully, they progress to different levels of competency in that skill that is marked by developing, intermediate, advanced, and expert markers.\n\nCodeSignal also has enterprise plans where it designs courses specific to a company using its knowledge base and cultural values. Sloyan said that in customized courses, companies can also opt for the AI character to have different personalities to help professionals practice different real-life situations.\n\nHowever, there is a question of baking in cultural sensitivity based on location and company culture. If that\u2019s not baked into the courses, they could create an unpleasant experience for employees.\n\nSumit Singla, an India-based HR consultant, said that AI might suggest being assertive in some cases, but in certain locations, that could be frowned upon.\n\n\u201cAI might encourage \u2018radical candor\u2019 in feedback, but in cultures where indirect communication is preferred, this could backfire. The tool may misinterpret humor, sarcasm, or culturally specific expressions, leading to awkward or incorrect responses in training,\u201d Singla said.\n\nHe believes that AI could be useful to practice some skills in a low-pressure environment. However, there is a chance that the tool might not have emotional intelligence or contextual awareness in some cases.\n\n\u201cIn training, one of the things we do is called \u2018reading the room.\u2019 AI won\u2019t be able to adjust to different personality types, work environments, or leadership styles. Soft skills development is highly personalized, and AI may not always give context-aware feedback,\u201d Singla noted.\n\nSloyan said that when the company works with different clients, it tries to bake in a lot of the cultural and personality context in the experiences, but he admitted that it is an iterative process. He said that CodeSignal also builds cultural templates when it starts to work in different locations and regions.\n\nThe startup, backed by Menlo Ventures and Index Ventures, is not the only one using AI for learning soft skills. Microsoft LinkedIn has also experimented with using AI-powered tools for courses in this segment. CodeSignal primarily engages with users on its website, and the company plans to launch iOS and Android apps later this year to expand its reach.",

                "text": "Uber customers in Austin may notice a new offer when they open the app and hail a ride: an invitation to signal their interest in a Waymo robotaxi.\n\nFor now, this doesn\u2019t translate into a Waymo picking them up. But it will soon.\n\nThe \u201cinterest list,\u201d which launched Wednesday, is part of a partnership between Uber and Waymo to operate a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025. The service is expected to begin soon in Austin, although neither company would share an official start date. A new co-branded robotaxi was also revealed Wednesday.\n\nThe \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service is the latest example of Uber\u2019s push back into autonomous vehicles. Uber divested of its own autonomous vehicle subsidiary, known as Uber ATG, through a complex deal with Aurora in December 2020. Prior to that, ironically, Uber and Waymo were archrivals, going head-to-head in lawsuits alleging Uber stole trade secrets belonging to Waymo (which at the time was part of Google/Alphabet, which today remains a majority shareholder) \u2014 Uber eventually settled the suits.\n\nUber has spent the past couple of years shoring up its position in the emerging robotaxi market. The company has partnered with 14 autonomous vehicle companies that cover ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking \u2014 a handful of which are operating commercially. In December, Uber launched robotaxi rides with WeRide in Abu Dhabi and Waymo\u2019s autonomous vehicles have been available on the Uber app in Phoenix since October 2023.\n\nBut in Austin and Atlanta, the arrangement with Waymo will be more exclusive.\n\nUnder the partnership, only Uber users will be able to hail Waymo\u2019s fleet of autonomous Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. (Waymo has operated its fleet in Phoenix and is now in the process of handing that job over to Moove.) Uber will handle the charging, maintenance, and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles, as well as managing access to the robotaxis via the app. Waymo will still monitor the tech and the autonomous operations, including rider assistance.\n\nThe Waymo robotaxis will be available to customers within 37 square miles of Austin, including downtown, Hyde Park, and Montopolis. The companies said they plan to expand that territory. The Waymo robotaxi fleet will be smaller to start \u2014 although Uber would not disclose a figure \u2014 and eventually grow to hundreds of vehicles across both Austin and Atlanta over the next few years.\n\nUber said riders who are matched with a Waymo will pay the same rate as human-driven options such as UberX or Uber Comfort.\n\nCustomers who sign up for the \u201cinterest list\u201d will receive updates from Uber and increase their chances of being matched with a Waymo autonomous vehicle at launch, according to the companies. To join, Uber customers in Austin need to update the app, then go to settings. From here, customers can click on ride preferences, where they should see a list that includes autonomous vehicles.",

                "text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI closed the year with \u201c12 Days of OpenAI,\u201d a series of 12 streams highlighting new product reveals and features. The event included the aforementioned Sora model, the rollout of real-time vision capabilities in Advanced Voice Mode, as well as a preview of its new \u201creasoning\u201d model family: o3 and o3-mini. You can revisit all the announcements on our live blog.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all big feature rollouts and model reveals though. OpenAI faced internal drama this year, including sizable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\n\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\n\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like \u2018chatty\u2019 and \u2018Gen Z\u2019\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nDecember 2024\n\nChatGPT Search can be tricked into misleading users, new research reveals\n\nChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries, The Guardian has found. They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews and generate \u201centirely positive\u201d summaries by inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI reportedly have a finance-centric definition of AGI\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have a very specific, internal definition of AGI based on the startup\u2019s profits, according to a new report from The Information. The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect.\n\nOpenAI trained o1 and o3 to \u2018think\u2019 about its safety policy\n\nOpenAI released new research outlining the company\u2019s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used \u201cdeliberative alignment\u201d to make o1 and o3 \u201cthink\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s safety policy. According to OpenAI\u2019s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered \u201cunsafe\u201d questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones.\n\nOpenAI announces new o3 reasoning models\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the successors to its o1 reasoning model family: o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline\n\nIn an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announced a 1-800 number to call the chatbot \u2014 even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode \u2014 minus the multimodality.\n\nOpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply.\n\nOpenAI brings its ChatGPT Search to more users\n\nOpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Search to free, logged in users. Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid users when it launched in October. Not only is Search available now for free users, but it\u2019s also been integrated into Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nOpenAI blames massive ChatGPT outage on a \u2018new telemetry service\u2019\n\nOpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a \u201cnew telemetry service\u201d gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn\u2019t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed to collect Kubernetes metrics.\n\nYou can make ChatGPT sound like Santa for a limited time\n\nOpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could access a new \u201cSanta Mode\u201d voice during December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, \u201cmerry and bright,\u201d as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly \u2014 more or less like every Santa you\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nOpenAI adds vision to Advanced Voice Mode\n\nOpenAI released the real-time video capabilities for ChatGPT that it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what\u2019s on a device\u2019s screen through screen sharing.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\n\nChatGPT and Sora hit with a major outage\n\nChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbus denied it in a post on X, saying the \u201coutage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.\u201d\n\nChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we've recovered. https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 12, 2024\n\nCanvas rolls out to everyone\n\nCanvas, OpenAI\u2019s collaboration-focused interface for writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs.\n\nOpenAI pauses Sora sign-ups due to high demand\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being.

You won\u2019t be able to save or share chats, use custom instructions, or other features associated with a persistent account. This version of ChatGPT will have \u201cslightly more restrictive content policies,\u201d according to OpenAI. When TechCrunch asked for more details, however, the response was unclear:\n\n\u201cThe signed out experience will benefit from the existing safety mitigations that are already built into the model, such as refusing to generate harmful content. In addition to these existing mitigations, we are also implementing additional safeguards specifically designed to address other forms of content that may be inappropriate for a signed out experience,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot store is filling up with spam\n\nTechCrunch found that the OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",

While Anduril founder Palmer Luckey is the face of the company, it names five men as co-founders, among them Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. Founders Fund has been an investor in Anduril from the start, leading its seed round in 2017. It also co-led Anduril\u2019s 2024 financing.\n\nThat previous round was to help pay for Anduril\u2019s billion-dollar weapons megafactory it is building in Ohio. Sources also told CNBC that the company\u2019s 2024 revenue doubled to $1 billion. Anduril declined further comment.",

                "text": "A number of startups are racing to make vehicle inspections faster, easier, and cheaper. Self Inspection, a startup based in San Diego, thinks it has them all beat with its AI-powered service \u2014 and now it has convinced outside investors.\n\nSelf Inspection, founded in 2021, is set to announce Thursday it\u2019s raised $3 million in seed round co-led by Costanoa Ventures and DVx Ventures, the firm run by former Tesla president Jon McNeill. Joining the round was Westlake Financial, which handles more than one million vehicle transactions annually.\n\nKarim Bousta, partner at DVx Ventures, believes the traditional vehicle inspection process is ripe for innovation. Self Inspection\u2019s technology \u201cnot only streamlines operations for auto lenders, dealerships and rental companies, but also sets a new benchmark for quality, reliability and a seamless digital experience in the $30 billion vehicle inspection market,\u201d Bousta said in a statement.\n\nThe seed round is validation of the tech the company has been working on for the last few years, CEO Constantine Yaremtso told TechCrunch. Self Inspection already counts Avis and CarOffer (a digital wholesaler owned by CarGurus) as customers, along with Westlake Financial.\n\n\u201cBasically we\u2019re going to start expanding, growing, and scaling,\u201d Yaremtso said about the funding.\n\nSelf Inspection has taken a much different path from UVEye, which recently raised $191 million for its AI-powered drive-through inspection technology.\n\nSelf Inspection only needs a smartphone camera, although its software can also leverage data pulled from a car\u2019s OBD2 port.\n\nThe company trained its AI models on what it describes as \u201cone of the largest datasets of damaged vehicles.\u201d Those models can quickly detect damage and assess the severity, before generating a cost estimate and \u201cone of the most thorough vehicle inspection reports available in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we deliver is actually a fully detailed PDF report that you would normally only get from a body shop, which will tell you what labor needs to be done on the damage, how much it costs to repair, how many parts do you need, and so on,\u201d Yaremtso said.\n\nSelf Inspection\u2019s service is designed to be simple but configurable, which also sets it apart from competitors like Ravin, Yaremtso said.\n\nIn other words, Self Inspection\u2019s software is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nWhat that means for customers is access to a slick back-end configurator. For instance, if a fleet or vehicle marketplace wants to prioritize certain high-wear areas of a car, or add a step to make sure an EV\u2019s charging cable is in the trunk, they can just drag and drop those in Self Inspection\u2019s software.\n\nSelf Inspection is also designed to be easier to use.\n\nThe software doesn\u2019t require users to be a specific distance away from a car as they take photos or videos, like other services do. And for now, it\u2019s not even a standalone app. Self Inspection integrates the software into its customers\u2019 own workflows, and all vehicle inspections are done through a smartphone\u2019s web browser \u2014 accessed after a user gets texted or emailed a link.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a good camera, everyone has a good phone, everyone knows how to capture photos. As soon as they receive text message or email, it\u2019s easy to go,\u201d Yaremtso said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give this tool to marketplaces, or banks, so anyone can inspect super simply and expedite the sales cycle process.\u201d",

                "text": "A large portion of Egypt\u2019s population lacks access to traditional banking, forcing many to rely on cash transactions and informal lending. Khazna, a fintech startup founded in 2019, is tackling this issue by offering financial services tailored toward low- and middle-income workers. The company provides solutions like salary advances, digital payments, and microloans to help employees and contractors access much-needed financial services.\n\nKhazna recently secured $16 million in pre-Series B funding, bringing its total funding to over $63 million. The investment will support its expansion plans as it prepares to apply for a digital banking license in Egypt and expand into Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen we covered the fintech in 2022, it had just raised a $38 million Series A with more than 150,000 customers across its products. Today, Khazna has grown its user base to over 500,000 people; that number is half what it was targeting by the end of 2022, according to what co-founder and CEO Omar Saleh shared at the time.\n\nThe company focuses on workers earning three times less than Egypt\u2019s minimum wage, providing them with affordable financial tools. About 100,000 users receive their payroll through Khazna, allowing the company to integrate financial services such as loans and insurance directly into their payroll accounts.\n\nFor the remaining 400,000 users, Khazna offers lending services, helping gig workers and pensioners access credit. Saleh explained that this product made the fintech break-even last month.\n\n\u201cWhat we did over the last two and half years was to focus on our core product, which is credit offering to payroll and pension recipients and also unsecured loans to gig workers,\u201d Saleh told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is the most profitable and core product in our journey, and getting it right was very important because it has helped us to hit profitability.\u201d\n\nOn the path to becoming a digital bank\n\nKhazna provides other services, like bill payments, buy now, pay later, medical insurance, and a rent-to-own product. But by embedding itself into both payroll and lending, it is strategically moving toward becoming a full-fledged digital bank for Egypt\u2019s underserved communities.\n\nBut one thing is missing: Unlike traditional banks, Khazna doesn\u2019t have access to customer deposits, making it expensive to fund loans. So far, Khazna has relied on wholesale debt financing in dollars (USD) and Egyptian pound (EGP) to fund its lending operations.\n\nTo reduce borrowing costs and offer more affordable loans, Khazna is now working to obtain a deposit-taking license in Egypt. This license would allow the startup to accept customer deposits, allowing it to lower its cost of funds.\n\n\u201cThe biggest game changer here is for us to get access to user deposits. There\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to capture part of that market as well in a way that will make our cost of funding much more attractive than it is today, and ultimately, that would put us in a very differentiated position,\u201d Saleh remarked.\n\nKhazna is targeting mid-2026 to secure the banking license from Egypt\u2019s Central Bank, which laid out its regulatory framework for digital banks in July 2024.\n\nAs the six-year-old fintech gets started with that process, it\u2019s simultaneously setting sights on Saudi Arabia, where there is a growing demand for consumer finance solutions. Unlike BNPL players like Tabby and Tamara, which focus on short-term BNPL credit, Khazna hopes to differentiate itself with medium-term credit products like earned wage access (EWA), payroll-backed lending, and pension-based credit.\n\nExpansion plans, including a not-so-imminent IPO\n\nAnother reason Khazna is prioritizing Saudi is its strong connection with Egypt, Saleh notes. With nearly three million Egyptians living in Saudi, the Egypt-Saudi remittance corridor is one of the world\u2019s largest, presenting an opportunity to offer cross-border financial services, combining credit-led offerings with foreign exchange (FX) solutions.\n\nBeyond market size and product fit, Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital markets are also a driver in Khazna\u2019s decision, according to Saleh. Tadawul, the stock exchange in Saudi Arabia, is one of the region\u2019s most liquid and retail-investor-driven stock exchanges, launching several IPOs over the past couple of years.\n\nFor that reason, Khazna plans to have 40-50% of its business coming from Saudi in the next four years, making it eligible for a public listing on Tadawul. For early-stage investors who have backed the company for four to five years, Saleh says this provides a clear path to a high-value exit.\n\nSure, Khazna will fund this expansion with the recently raised growth capital. However, the macroeconomic challenges in Egypt over the past two years had a hand in structuring this pre-Series B round.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, Egypt faced currency devaluations and economic instability, making fundraising more difficult for startups and ventures. The overall slowdown in deal flow reflected this, as investors took a cautious approach to Egyptian startups. But 2024 brought a major shift, with over $50 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into Egypt following economic reforms and a more flexible exchange rate. As a result, investor confidence returned, bringing renewed interest from global and regional investors.\n\nAs such, Khazna welcomed participation from new and existing investors, including global investors like Quona and Speedinvest, as well as regional investment firms like Aljazira Capital (the investment arm of Bank Aljazira of Saudi Arabia), anb Seed Fund (managed by anb Capital), DisrupTECH, ICU Ventures, Khwarizmi Ventures, and SANAD Fund for MSME.",

                "text": "Self-driving truck startup Waabi is partnering with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to jointly develop and deploy autonomous trucks, an important milestone as it gets closer to a commercial launch.\n\nThe tie-up also marks Volvo\u2019s second partnership to co-develop self-driving big rigs with a startup partner. In May 2024, Volvo teamed up with Aurora Innovation to reveal the Volvo VNL Autonomous truck.\n\nWaabi will be using the same truck, but it will have Waabi\u2019s tech on it, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software.\n\n\u201cWe now have everything we need to scale our product,\u201d Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have the next-generation AV 2.0 technology, we have an approach that is much more capital efficient, and a much faster path to market.\u201d\n\nWaabi plans to launch commercial pilots with the Volvo-built trucks in Texas over the next couple of months. The startup is working towards a product-ready driverless demonstration on public roads for the end of 2025. A fully driverless commercial launch \u2014 directly between customer depots from day one, rather than via terminals \u2014 will follow soon afterward, according to Urtasun.\n\nThe founder did not confirm if Waabi\u2019s first driverless launch will be with Volvo or a future OEM partner.\n\nUrtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021, claims to have built AI models that can reason as a human would, which in turn speeds up commercial deployment and makes for a more efficient system overall. She has reasoned that a better-quality AI will require much less data and compute to understand and react to the world around it.\n\nWaabi has relied on its simulation technology to not just test and train its self-driving technology, but also to help design trucks for OEM integration. The startup unveiled its first purpose-built truck \u2014 with sensors, compute, and software built in at the assembly line \u2014 in 2022.\n\nBy contrast, competitor Kodiak Robotics has developed a self-driving system that includes all of the redundant hardware and software system, but is not tied to one manufacturer. Urtasun is more interested in integrating the Waabi Driver into autonomous trucks at the factory level with no interruption to an OEM\u2019s assembly line.\n\nUrtasun believes this is the best approach to building a safe, reliable product.\n\nWaabi\u2019s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker\u2019s strategic investment into the startup two years ago via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital. Volvo later participated in Waabi\u2019s $200 million Series B.\n\nVolvo will build trucks for Waabi at its production-ready facility in Virginia. Urtasun said the first \u201chandful\u201d would come off the assembly line in 2025, and that she expects a timeline of around two to three years to reach volume scale.\n\nOver that time, Urtasun also noted that capital efficiency will be \u201can absolute must\u201d to be successful in this industry. She says Waabi\u2019s \u201cAI-first approach\u201d means the startup\u2019s capital needs to get to a driverless launch will be \u201ca tiny fraction of what you see in the industry today.\u201d\n\nTo date, Waabi has raised $282 million, per PitchBook data, and Urtasun says the startup has enough to launch a driverless operation on public roads and beyond. Its main competitors, Aurora and Kodiak, have raised $3.46 billion and $243 million, respectively.\n\nAurora plans to launch a driverless commercial trucking operation in April, and Kodiak last month delivered its first autonomous trucks to a commercial partner that will use them for off-road operations.\n\n\u201c2025 is the year of trucking; it\u2019s a make it or break it situation,\u201d Urtasun said. \u201cI think there will be potentially more consolidation.\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t many players left in the game since Embark and TuSimple shut down and Waymo paused its autonomous truck ambitions.\n\nWhen asked if Waabi was considering a merger or acquisition, Urtasun replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. Trucking is only the beginning. We\u2019re going to do so much more than trucking \u2014 robotaxis, warehouse robotics. I have tremendously big plans for the company, and we are going to remain a fully independent company.\u201d\n\nThis article has been updated to clarify that Waabi\u2019s driverless launch may or may not be with Volvo-built trucks.",

                "text": "\u201cTabular data\u201d is a broad term that encompasses structured data that generally fits into a specific row and column. It can be an SQL database, a spreadsheet, a .CSV file, etc.\n\nWhile there has been tremendous progress on artificial intelligence applied to unstructured and sequential data, these large language models (LLMs) are fuzzy by design. They are built to manipulate input tokens to generate a coherent output without necessarily following a fixed structure. The best LLMs are also either expensive to access via an API or expensive to run on your own cloud infrastructure.\n\nAnd yet, many companies already have a data strategy with a data warehouse or data lake to centralize all important data and some data scientists that can leverage this data to improve the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nFrench startup Neuralk-AI is an artificial intelligence company that has been working on AI models focused on tabular data. The company this week announced $4 million in funding.\n\n\u201cData with real value for companies is data that was identified a long time ago, structured in the form of a table, and used by the data scientists of these companies to create all their machine learning algorithms,\u201d Neuralk-AI co-founder and chief scientific officer Alexandre Pasquiou told TechCrunch.\n\nNeuralk-AI thinks there\u2019s an opportunity in revisiting AI model development, but with a specific focus on structured data. At first, it plans to offer its model as an API to data scientists working for commerce companies because these companies love data \u2014 think product catalogs, customer databases, shopping cart trends, etc.\n\n\u201cToday, LLMs are great for search, natural user interaction, and answering questions based on unstructured documents. But it has some limitations the moment we go back to classic machine learning, which is really based on classic tabular data,\u201d Pasquiou said.\n\nWith Neuralk-AI, retailers can automate complex data workflows with smart deduplication and enrichment. But they could also use the company\u2019s models to detect fraud, optimize the product recommendations, and generate sales forecasts that could be used for inventory management and product pricing.\n\nFly Ventures led the company\u2019s $4 million round with Steam AI also participating. Several business angels also invested in the startup, such as Thomas Wolf from Hugging Face, Charles Gorintin from Alan, and Philippe Corrot and Nagi Letaifa from Mirakl.\n\nThe team is still actively working on its models. It plans to test with a group of leading French retailers and commerce startups, such as E.Leclerc, Auchan, Mirakl, and Lucky Cart.\n\n\u201cWithin three or four months, we\u2019ll release the first version of our model and the public benchmark on which we\u2019ll be able to rank our model compared to the state-of-the-art in this space,\u201d Pasquiou said. \u201cAnd in September, the idea is to be the best tabular foundation model in everything related to representation learning.\u201d",

                "text": "Last month, Apple offered up more insight into its consumer robotics work via a research paper that argues that traits like expressive movements are key to optimizing human-robot interaction. \u201cLike most animals,\u201d starts the report, \u201chumans are highly sensitive to motion and subtle changes in movement.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate its point, Apple pays homage to Pixar, another company founded with help from the late Steve Jobs. Since Pixar first debuted in an eponymous 1985 short film, the Luxo Jr. lamp has served as the animation studio\u2019s long-time mascot. For its research, Apple, too, chose a lamp for its own \u201cnon-anthropomorphic\u201d example. After all, lamps don\u2019t possess any obvious humanlike traits, but they can be made to behave in familiar ways.\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\n\u201cFor robots to interact more naturally with humans,\u201d the paper notes, \u201crobot movement design should likewise integrate expressive qualities, such as intention, attention, and emotions, alongside traditional functional considerations like task fulfillment and time efficiency.\u201d\n\nA video released in conjunction with the paper showcases some of these movements. Unsurprisingly, they mostly echo those of Pixar\u2019s creation. That includes the same analogous parts, with the lampshade serving as the head, while the arm stands in for a neck.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the video, with regard to potential productization, comes as a user queries the robot. At its simplest, the unnamed lamp robot operates as a more kinetic version of a HomePod, Amazon Echo, or other smart speaker. The person facing the lamp asks a query and the robot responds in Siri\u2019s voice.\n\nImage Credits:Apple\n\nA split screen video highlights the importance of expressive movements. Asked what the weather is like outside, one version simply states the answer. The other swivels its head to look out the window as if the view offers insight on which the robot can draw. It\u2019s a simple example, but one that drives home how even small movements tap into our lizard brain\u2019s pareidolia. The familiarity of expressive movements helps form a connection between human and object.\n\n\n\nScreenshot Image Credits:Apple\n\nApple\u2019s research arrives as the company is reportedly ramping up its consumer robotics efforts ahead of the planned release of a more advanced smart home system. It\u2019s clear how these learnings might be applied to make a robotic home hub more expressive. It\u2019s similar to the approach Amazon has taken with its Astro robot. However, the inclusion of a non-anthropomorphic form factor in the research implies that the robot may be even less humanoid than Amazon\u2019s.\n\nRumors surrounding the upcoming release have described the hub as \u201ca robot arm with an iPad attached.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see how the lamp form factor could be applied there. Of course, Apple\u2019s consumer robotics division appears to still be the research phase. Plenty can happen between now and then, from a major shift in form factor to a decision to pull the plug on the project prior to launch.",

At the time, there were reports that the Chinese government was open to a deal in which Musk (a key Trump ally) would acquire the app. Trump even told reporters that he\u2019d like to see Musk or Oracle chairman Larry Ellison acquire TikTok; he\u2019s also signed an executive order to create a sovereign wealth fund that could purchase a stake in the app.\n\nBut Musk claimed that he wasn\u2019t interested, flatly stating, \u201cI have not put in a bid for TikTok.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans for what would I do if I had TikTok,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI guess I would look at the algorithm and try to decide: How helpful or useful is this algorithm? And what can we do to shift the algorithm to be more productive and ultimately be beneficial to humanity?\u201d\n\nHe added that he doesn\u2019t \u201cuse TikTok personally\u201d and is \u201cnot that familiar with it.\u201d And he described his acquisition of Twitter (now X) as an anomaly in his career: \u201cI usually build companies from scratch.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s comments on TikTok came nearly 20 minutes into the interview, which initially focused on his plans for his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration. Musk and his allies have subsequently taken control of federal agencies and gained access to large troves of sensitive data.\n\n\u201cWith respect to government, really the challenge is overcoming bureaucracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think bureaucracy is perhaps the penultimate boss battle. The ultimate boss battle is defeating entropy \u2026 The second hardest battle is defeating bureaucracy. That\u2019s how difficult it is to improve government.\u201d",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nSo I had like four times where I thought,\n\nhey, I'm pretty good at programming,\n\nand then I was either given a hard task or feedback\n\nand I said, No, there's another level here.\n\nAnd so by the time I go to Harvard,\n\nI've had thousands of hours\n\nof complex programming experience.\n\nI was so lucky in those things.\n\nHi, I'm Steven Levy.\n\nToday we spoke with Bill Gates about privilege,\n\nhis desire to succeed, and how,\n\nas a kid, he drove his parents insane.\n\nThis is The Big Interview. [intense music]\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nI know that you have been thinking\n\nabout doing a first-person book,\n\nsome sort of autobiography, for many, many years.\n\nI talked to you about it like 30 years ago maybe.\n\nWhy do that now?\n\nI hired Rob Gupt to help me dig out all the old facts,\n\nget the report cards, and go talk to all of my friends\n\nand colleagues from early days.\n\nSo yes, it's a project we've been working on for some time.\n\nIt was only about 18 months ago\n\nthat we decided taking this first phase of my life,\n\nabout 25 years, right as I start Microsoft,\n\nand doing a book where my parents, my upbringing,\n\nthe luck of what I was exposed to, that was the whole story.\n\nAnd once that idea came up, I got quite enthused about it,\n\nbecause we weren't getting into the current stuff\n\nwhere there's still a lot not figured out.\n\nI mean, the foundation's goals are ongoing.\n\nEven Microsoft, although I play a modest role as an advisor,\n\nthe AI stuff is of course very, very much ongoing.\n\nAnd so it was really fun to take this period\n\nand try and explain how amazing my father was, my mother,\n\nmy sisters, just a huge variety of things\n\nthat got me to be kind of forward looking.\n\nAnd by the time I'm 20 years old,\n\nI found myself more enmeshed in programming and the magic\n\nof what programming could do than almost anyone.\n\nSo I love the way it's come out,\n\nthat we just do this first 25-year period,\n\nwhich we're calling Source Code.\n\nAnd then another book can take the whole Microsoft story.\n\nAnd then a different one can take the philanthropic work\n\nand contemplate that.\n\nWell, by doing that, by breaking that out,\n\nit becomes way more personal\n\nthan anything that we've seen from you.\n\nPeople like me have been pounding you, asking you questions.\n\nWhen can these self-reflectives?\n\nAnd you've done it here.\n\nI know that you admire the Agassi book by J.R. Moehringer.\n\nI don't know whether you considered him to be a co-writer.\n\nIs that a thought you might have?\n\nNo, we, I mean, we had our team pretty early on.\n\nBut that's a great book.\n\nBut you, in a way, went on there\n\nand you held a mirror to yourself.\n\nThis is very much a bildungsroman,\n\nlike a coming-of-age story.\n\nAnd sometimes the mirror didn't portray\n\nsuch a flattering image, did it?\n\nI mean, I had my ups and downs.\n\nI had conflicts with my parents.\n\nI had, I was using Harvard computer time,\n\nand they were confused about what I was doing.\n\nThe first customer, you had MITS, we had a complex contract.\n\nWe ended up in a dispute, surprisingly, with them.\n\nMy relationship with Paul is a very central piece\n\nof how Microsoft comes together,\n\nand Paul and I are working together super well,\n\nand then disagreeing.\n\nSo yes, between my parents and Paul.\n\nAnd I had a lot of uncertainty,\n\neven though the software thing,\n\nthere were many experiences that made that\n\njust such a unique thing that, wow,\n\nwhy do I see this when other people don't see it.\n\nBut yeah, it's hopefully a very human story.\n\nIt's not immaculate conception.\n\nWell, it is a human story,\n\nand I think one where it gets to very emotional ground.\n\nI remember I did a profile of you, I think in 1999.\n\nAnd your father told me a little bit\n\nabout some of the stuff in here,\n\nand he said your mother was traumatized by the situation.\n\nYou wouldn't talk for days on end.\n\nYou say yourself that the things that really interested you\n\nwere like reading, and math, and being inside your own head,\n\nand in some ways you weren't kind to your parents.\n\nAnd I think unrolling some instances like that,\n\nyou seem a little remorseful.\n\nWell, I give both of my parents, each in their own way,\n\na lot of credit for how they shaped me.\n\nYou know, with my dad, it was much more setting an example\n\nof always being serious about his work,\n\nof sharing anecdotes.\n\nWith my mom, it was far more intense, that,\n\nOh, you didn't get up here as soon as I wanted,\n\nor, Your table manners weren't as good as I wanted.\n\nSo yeah, in the case of my mom, I was often falling short.\n\nShe did get me to interact with the adults that were around.\n\nThat was a skill that became quite valuable for me.\n\nSo she helped compliment my intense desire\n\nto study and understand things.\n\nBut yeah, the tension between my mom and I was,\n\nshe was always pushing for me to do better,\n\nand eventually proud of what I achieved.\n\nBut that was a complex relationship.\n\nVery amazing, I mean, my mom was a phenomenal person,\n\nnot just her social skills,\n\nor her ambition for herself, her husband, and me,\n\nbut just, she was a special person.\n\nClearly there was a lot of love,\n\nbut they were at their wit's end\n\nto figure out what to do with you.\n\nTowards the end of the book, you say something that,\n\nyou say if this were today you would've been diagnosed,\n\nyou said, probably, on the autism spectrum.\n\nWhat led you to that conclusion?\n\nWhen did you start thinking about that?\n\nWell, I know when I was growing up, this idea that they,\n\nI would go and talk to a therapist\n\nwas actually quite an unusual thing.\n\nAnd this guy, Dr. Cressey, who really got me thinking about,\n\nokay, what was I trying to achieve\n\nin this conflict with my parents.\n\nDid I really have some thought in mind\n\nor was I just trying to make trouble?\n\nThat was, I think, quite unusual.\n\nBut back then, the idea that kids were very different,\n\nand there some kind of interventions,\n\nthat just wasn't commonplace at all.\n\nI was clearly somewhat hyperactive.\n\nI could concentrate a great deal.\n\nI think, in fact, I did get to see that therapist was good.\n\nWho knows what it would've been like?\n\nKids are much more looked over.\n\nThe thing where I was able to go off to the computer center,\n\nor even spend all that time alone,\n\neven going out on those hikes,\n\npeople are protective enough, they might view a lot of that.\n\nYeah, you describe these epic, crazy hikes\n\nthat you wouldn't think of sending a 12-year-old\n\nor 13-year-old today.\n\nThey were super dangerous.\n\nYeah, even though now you'd have a GPS tracker.\n\nWell, has that realization sort of shaped you?\n\nYou're a super curious person.\n\nCuriosity is something that runs through this book.\n\nHave you like pursued the curiosity about that,\n\nin terms of understanding yourself?\n\nWell, I do, even at this age, I love learning new things,\n\nand I view all of my work as kind of being a student,\n\nand super lucky, not just the things I get to read, but.\n\nAnd these days you can learn so easily.\n\nAnd then I get access to experts.\n\nI mean, when I'm confused about AI,\n\nSam Altman gets 10 people together and we sit and talk.\n\nI'm very lucky that my career path has meant\n\nthat my deep curiosity, I've been able to maintain it.\n\nAnd I think it is part of my success,\n\nis really wanting to understand things in a pretty deep way.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nAnother thing which struck me, reading the book,\n\nis I knew you came from a well-off family.\n\nAnd something, again, you refer to\n\ntowards the end of the book,\n\nhow much privilege is part of your story.\n\nYou say, I was like a white male\n\nthat's in a privileged position.\n\nBut your family was very well off.\n\nAt various parts, your father sort of like swoops down\n\nwith like legal help, and you get in trouble at Harvard,\n\nand he flies out across the country.\n\nAnd it seems that, just at other times,\n\nteachers would come in, even though you were\n\ninside your own head, people had your back at every turn.\n\nOh, there were teachers who put such a high percentage\n\nof their time into me versus the other students.\n\nI was so lucky in those things.\n\nAnd the one funny thing is my parents were well off,\n\nbut compared to the kids at this private school I was at,\n\nI was below average.\n\nI mean, they had bigger houses and they had wealth.\n\nMy dad was well paid to be a lawyer,\n\nbut we weren't a family that had wealth.\n\nSo I managed to both have the benefit\n\nof being at that school and actually have a little bit\n\nof a chip on my shoulder that, hey,\n\nyou guys are so much better off,\n\nyour parents gave you a car,\n\nand you didn't have to work in the summer.\n\nBut yes, you could hardly design a better childhood,\n\nincluding a timesharing computer terminal showing up\n\nwhen I'm 13 years old, and the high school scheduling,\n\nwhich is a super interesting algorithmic problem where,\n\nbecause I was good at math, they asked me to solve it.\n\nYeah, you did this unbelievable scheduling thing\n\nfor your school. Right.\n\nAnd the first time they asked me, I say,\n\nNo, I don't know how to do that.\n\nAnd then six months later when, tragically,\n\nthe people who are working on it are in a plane crash,\n\nI've actually figured out how to do it.\n\nSo the first serious algorithm was actually deciding\n\nwhen the classes would meet,\n\nand who would be in which classes,\n\nwhich is a very kind of cool problem.\n\nAnd so then to have that,\n\nthen to have TRW have this incredible project\n\nthat was very state of the art,\n\nin terms of real time reliability,\n\nand to have the great programmers there, including Norton,\n\nembrace me and say, Yeah, you think you're good,\n\nbut this code is not very good.\n\nRight, this was like a mentor you had\n\nwhen you were working on this project for TRW as a kid.\n\nRight, so I had like four times where I thought,\n\nhey, I'm pretty good at programming,\n\nand then I was either given a hard task or got feedback\n\nand I said, No, there's another level here.\n\nSo by the time I go to Harvard, I've had thousands of hours\n\nof complex programming experience.\n\nAnd then when I get there, I get to do even more.\n\nSo yes, the fact that parents encouraged me, as a male,\n\nthe idea of doing all, being weird like this was,\n\neh, it was kind of okay.\n\nThe school I went to,\n\nand that high school is a fantastic high school.\n\nI had at least five or six teachers\n\nwho kind of saw a spark in me and really engaged with me.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, in his book about outliers,\n\nsays that the ingredients are like 10,000 hours,\n\ncertainly you've topped that by a big number,\n\nin terms of programming,\n\n10,000 hours of practice doing something.\n\nI guess a degree of timeliness, which you just talked about.\n\nI still find that kind of unsatisfying.\n\nWhat makes Bill Gates, Bill Gates?\n\nWell certainly it's not just the circumstances,\n\nbut that's gigantic.\n\nI mean that eliminates people born at a different time,\n\nand many people\n\nwho didn't get the educational opportunities.\n\nYes, there's still a few million kids\n\nwho are in the same milieu that I am.\n\nAnd then it's okay, seeing my father,\n\nunderstanding the common sense of business,\n\nseeing a business like Physio Control that was up and down,\n\nthe early engagement with Digital Equipment Corporation,\n\nwhich to me was this vaunted company\n\nthat proved that it wasn't just mainframes,\n\nand those people embraced me.\n\nI mean, I got to know them in many phases,\n\nincluding once they offered me a job,\n\njust 'cause I wanted that reinforcement.\n\nSo yes, there's something about my desire to succeed,\n\nand my skillset, being forward looking,\n\nwhich my friend Kent Evans, who's in the book,\n\nhelped really cement that.\n\nKent helped shape me as forward looking, amazing person.\n\nAnd then Paul's more off reading about the chip stuff.\n\nI didn't read Electronics magazine.\n\nWell after Paul showed me it, okay, then I did.\n\nBut that's Paul, and it's actually pretty unnatural,\n\n'cause he's two years ahead of me,\n\nthe fact that he seeks me out and says,\n\nBill, what does exponential improvement mean?\n\nAnd I say, Are you kidding?\n\nThat is mine.\n\nExponential improvement is a very, very special thing\n\nthat doesn't happen except in rare, rare, rare cases.\n\nPaul also clued you on to LSD,\n\nwhich you talk about taking a couple times.\n\nSteve Jobs would always say\n\nthat was like the formative experience\n\nand helped open up the gates of design in his mind.\n\nI don't get that impression that you felt that\n\nto be a life-changing experience.\n\nI think the batch that he got\n\nmust have really been good [Steven laughs]\n\nfor product design and marketing.\n\nI mean, my god, just think if I'd had that batch.\n\nYeah, I did some crazy things when I was young,\n\nand Paul deserved some credit for that.\n\nBut yeah, we did that together a few times.\n\nEventually we gave it up.\n\nBy the time we get serious about work,\n\nwe're not doing that anymore.\n\nYou also mentioned the famous time you got busted\n\nfor speeding and spent the night in jail.\n\nI was hoping to learn more about that.\n\nDid that freak you out, spending a night in jail?\n\nNo, it was just kind of a funny thing.\n\nI mean, they thought it was strange to have somebody\n\nso young that had a nice car.\n\nYou had a Porsche.\n\nWhat was the story with this kid?\n\nWas I a drug dealer or something?\n\nI clearly didn't fit their normal pattern.\n\nWe kept enough cash around\n\nthat Paul was able to come down and bail me out,\n\nbut took him a few hours to get it together.\n\nSo yeah, there's that, a famous mugshot of me in Albuquerque\n\nbecause I got pulled over and didn't have my license.\n\nIn the end of the book,\n\nyou say that sometimes you look back\n\nand wish you were back again\n\nwhere you were when you were 13 years old,\n\nand just like learning about everything.\n\nAnd you describe yourself, at that time,\n\nas someone who just lived largely inside your head.\n\nTalk about that. Are you?\n\nWith all your success, and all the access to the world,\n\nreally, that you have, you look back,\n\nand wanna roll the tape back?\n\nWell, I've been so lucky\n\nthat I'm not saying I want to go back and change something.\n\nBut it was kind of amazing to live through that,\n\nhey, I'm just this kid and all of us are the same,\n\nto okay, here's something I'm curious about,\n\nhere's some people to do it with me.\n\nHaving a dream, a computer on every desk in every home,\n\nthe importance of software,\n\nto actually have it come completely true\n\nand get to work with, in this phase of my life,\n\nwith Kent, and with Paul,\n\nand I'm just meeting Steve Ballmer at Harvard,\n\nbut he hasn't come to help.\n\nI'm sure we'll hear a lot about that.\n\nThat'll be right at the start of the Microsoft book.\n\nWe're up in Seattle and I decide,\n\nboy, I can't run this thing myself.\n\nI need my friend who really gets business,\n\nand management, and people, and so he comes in.\n\nSo it was so magical and so incredible\n\nthat I do kind of miss that wonderful thing\n\nwhere the whole thing was in doubt.\n\nThere were days when I thought, oh, we are so messed up,\n\nand other people are ahead of us,\n\nand who do we think we are to have these wild dreams,\n\nand yet, step by step,\n\nwe build this incredible group of people.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nYou know, it's interesting, the book, again,\n\nis a coming-of-age story.\n\nBut you talk about, you look back\n\nand say how much we are shaped by who we are,\n\nand we are like who we are.\n\nYou talk about saying, boy,\n\nI think somewhat remorsefully saying,\n\nI was like a smart aleck in school\n\nand that wasn't a smart thing to do.\n\nAnd you talk about being, pushing back about everyone.\n\nAnd it made me think really the way you behaved\n\nin your deposition, being a smart aleck there.\n\nAh, you think I was a smart aleck, that lawyer,\n\nnow that's a smart aleck. [Steven laughs]\n\nNot recalling the specifics of the interview is\n\nthat it's very unlikely I would make a statement like that\n\nwithout some common understanding between myself\n\nand the reporter of what that term,\n\nwhich, out of context, is incredibly ambiguous,\n\nwhat it meant in the context of her series of questions.\n\n[Lawyer] And just to be sure I understand it,\n\nwhat you're saying is that you don't remember\n\nwhat the definition was,\n\nand you don't even remember that there was a definition,\n\nbut you believe there must have been a definition\n\nor you wouldn't have been using these words.\n\nIs that fair?\n\nThere must have been a common understanding,\n\nI wouldn't say a definition.\n\nThere's a certain clever boy shortcut use of sarcasm\n\nthat allows you to communicate efficiently.\n\nIt can be kind of funny.\n\nAnd yes, that whole kind of sparring,\n\nthat sitting at night at Harvard, talking to each other,\n\nthat kind of dialogue doesn't work\n\nwhen you're managing people.\n\nOr even my skill of procrastination, which at Harvard,\n\nthat was my personal position was,\n\nah, I don't work in these classes 'til late.\n\nSo yeah, there's a lot of habits of being a young,\n\ntrying to be a cool, maybe not succeeding,\n\nbut trying to be a cool student,\n\nthat I actually had to break those habits,\n\nprocrastination, being super clever and kind of sarcastic,\n\ntearing somebody's argument apart.\n\nI mean, yes, the underlying skill is actually worthwhile,\n\nbut knowing not to deploy it as the kind of go-to approach,\n\nwhich when I was a student was kind of my whole way\n\nof engaging with other people.\n\nWe have the one anecdote in there\n\nwhere I told this professor how wrong he was,\n\nand I was just so certain of myself.\n\nAnd you were wrong.\n\nAnd then five minutes after I attack him,\n\nI realized, oh god,\n\nthere's a reason why it actually comes back.\n\nAnd his thing was completely right\n\nand I was completely wrong.\n\nThat was a helpful experience\n\nbecause the guy was so nice about it,\n\nand I was so outta line.\n\nOne final question, do people really change?\n\nNo, I think you moderate,\n\nand you become wiser, and you grow.\n\nBut the idea of, am I still pretty much\n\nthat same kind of hyperactive, curious,\n\nmaybe I can figure this out\n\nthat other people can't figure out.\n\nAnd if I do figure it out, what am I gonna do about it?\n\nWho do I work with on this?\n\nI'm still 95% that same person.\n\nBill, thanks so much for doing The Big Interview.\n\nThank you.

You'd find them on every continent.\n\nAnd then we see this impact layer,\n\nthis ash, the fallout from the asteroid,\n\nand nowhere on Earth has anyone found\n\na single in-place dinosaur fossil\n\none centimeter above this layer.\n\nWe can see that there was a day in history when, poof,\n\nthey were gone.\n\n@Whereisbrandon writes, If asteroids killed the dinosaurs,\n\nhow come every other animal that was alive\n\nat the same time as them, that's still alive now, survived?\n\nThe biggest killer that day, when the asteroid struck,\n\nwas the heat.\n\nSo if you were on the surface of the Earth\n\nand had no place to hide, you'd die that day.\n\nIf you could get underground,\n\nlike a little shrew-like mammal, or a lizard,\n\nor crocodiles, or good burrowers, or even birds,\n\nthere were birds at the end of the Cretaceous period,\n\nif you could get under the ground that day,\n\nyou had a chance at surviving.\n\n@DaRealLemm1ng asks, Where is the asteroid\n\nthat killed the dinosaurs? Has it ever been found?\n\nIt has been found actually.\n\nAnd there's a crater off the Yucatan Peninsula,\n\nthat's the east coast of Mexico,\n\nthat's about 110 miles across and 12 miles deep.\n\nIt was published in 1991,\n\nthat's when scientists knew about it.\n\nBut, actually, petroleum companies knew about it\n\nsince the seventies and they didn't tell anyone\n\n'cause they're petroleum companies.\n\nThe asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs\n\nwas about 18 kilometers across,\n\ntraveling at about 45 times the speed of a bullet,\n\nand it probably landed in the springtime\n\nbecause there are some fish in North Dakota,\n\nsome fossil fish,\n\nthat have spring pollen trapped in their gills.\n\n@SunpaiTarku asks a good question,\n\nWhich animal species came the closest to going extinct\n\nand then successfully recovered?\n\nWell, the best example I know of is the California condor,\n\nin 1972, was down to about 22 individuals.\n\nThe chemical DDT was causing their eggshells\n\nto be soft and to break, and so they couldn't reproduce.\n\nPlus, they're scavengers,\n\nso they would eat a dead deer that had been shot by a hunter\n\nwith a lead shot, and they were getting lead poisoning.\n\nAnd so through an amazing effort,\n\nzoos and other conservation organizations,\n\nthey captured every single remaining condor, all 22.\n\nThey had an intensive breeding program\n\nand then they started to release them back into the wild.\n\nThey are not outta danger,\n\nthey are still a critically endangered species,\n\nbut right now there are about\n\n550 California condors in the world.\n\nSome of them have actually made their way from California\n\nto Zion National Park,\n\nand there's now a small breeding population\n\nof California condors there.\n\nSo they seem to be moving in the right direction\n\nbecause we took action, because we banned DDT,\n\nbecause California banned lead shots.\n\nSo it's not like we're helpless in these cases,\n\nthere are things that we can do\n\nto help pull these organisms back from the brink,\n\nbut the time to act is now.\n\n@Nomondensele asks, What's the worst that could happen\n\nif mosquitoes and flies were to be extinct?\n\nWell, although they are pests,\n\nsmall insects like that are really down\n\npretty close to the base of the food chain.\n\nAnd you think about all the things\n\nthat eat mosquitoes and flies,\n\nthere are a lot of birds, frogs,\n\nother amphibians, small mammals.\n\nAnd so you know what?\n\nIf you wanna precipitate an extinction event,\n\nif you wanna wipe out the big animals, kill off the insects,\n\nthat's the best way to do it.\n\n@Hombre_del_queso, or Cheese Man,\n\nHow many animals have humans hunted to extinction?\n\nCertainly we have examples.\n\nWhen the government of Australia\n\nput a bounty on the Tasmanian tiger,\n\npeople went out and shot every single one of them.\n\nThere's a heartbreaking film of the last Tasmanian tiger\n\ncircling rearly in this cage,\n\nand that was the last of its species.\n\nPassenger pigeons, we killed all of them just for sport.\n\nThey used to block out the sun for hours\n\nwith flocks of billions.\n\nDodos, Dutch sailors would club them to death.\n\nThey wouldn't eat them, they would just stack them up\n\nand use them for firewood.\n\nThe same thing happened to the great auk,\n\nwhich was sort of the penguin of the North Atlantic.\n\nAnd then if you go back a little further in time\n\nto Stone Age humans, the woolly mammoth,\n\nand the woolly rhino, and the giant ground sloth,\n\nand all those amazing Pleistocene creatures\n\nthat all of a sudden died when humans showed up.\n\n@Based_shiver states, 'Invasive species are bad.\n\nThey outcompete native ones!'\n\nYeah, so? It's called the free market.\n\nIt's true, in that there's natural selection\n\nthat is occurring,\n\nbut invasive species for the most part,\n\nare able to invade those places because of us,\n\nbecause of our transportation systems,\n\nor sometimes intentionally humans releasing them\n\ninto the environment.\n\nAnd the result of that is that native species go extinct,\n\nnative species that are important in the ecosystem\n\nor important to us as maybe a food crop,\n\nand so, you know, I don't think we wanna really be playing\n\nplanetary engineer with the Earth's biosphere.\n\n@Deathbykoolaidman writes,\n\nWhat extinct animals do you think\n\nis really just hidden away from humans?\n\nI would be surprised if us paleontologists\n\nhave discovered 1% of the species that have ever lived.\n\nAnd if you look at just the group that we call dinosaurs,\n\nif you go back to the early part of the last century,\n\nthere was a new dinosaur species published\n\nabout once every year.\n\nBy the seventies, it was about a half a dozen a year.\n\nAnd now, it's about one a week.\n\nNow there are some animals that were at one point\n\nbelieved to have gone extinct, that are later found alive.\n\nIt's very, very rare,\n\nthey're actually called Lazarus species,\n\nand a good example of that would be the coelacanth,\n\nwhich is a very ancient fish.\n\nIt lived alongside of the dinosaurs,\n\nand it was believed to be extinct until one was dredged up\n\noff the coast of South Africa in the 1930s.\n\nThere's a pine tree called the Wollemia pine\n\nthat was thought to have been extinct\n\nsince the Cretaceous period,\n\nand in the nineties, it was discovered alive\n\nin a valley in Australia.\n\nSo this can happen, but it's very, very rare.\n\nMost things that we determine\n\nare extinct in the fossil record, we never see again.\n\n@GreatBluePanda asks,\n\nWhat if super-volcano 'Yellowstone' erupts?\n\nWhat happens to all species?\n\nWell, probably bad things.\n\nYellowstone is a giant super-volcano.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't discovered until just a few decades ago\n\nbecause it's so big,\n\ngeologists didn't know they were inside a volcano.\n\nIt was when satellite imagery started to become available\n\nthat we saw Yellowstone as this huge, huge volcanic caldera.\n\nThe last time it had a really huge eruption\n\nwas about 600,000 years ago,\n\nand parts of the West were covered with 600 feet of ash.\n\n600 feet.\n\nIf that were to ever happen again,\n\nit would take out a lot of the United States.\n\nEven here in New York, a couple thousand miles away,\n\nthere would be terrible effects.\n\nThe ash would reach New York,\n\naviation here, and probably globally, would shut down.\n\nIt's probably not going to erupt tomorrow,\n\nbut there is going to be a tomorrow someday.\n\n@Maverick8358 writes,\n\nWould we as humans be extinct\n\nif another Chixilub asteroid hit Earth?\n\nProbably not. Not at least initially.\n\nAnd when an asteroid hits, the most deadly moment\n\nis when the fallout comes in,\n\nthe rock and the dust that's blasted from the impact zone\n\ngoes into space\n\nand then resettles back through the atmosphere.\n\nYou can imagine the energy released\n\nby the impact in the case of the asteroid\n\nthat wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nA body of rock the size of Massachusetts\n\ntimes 12 miles deep, was blasted into space.\n\nSo that day when the dinosaurs died,\n\nglobal temperatures got up to probably somewhere between\n\ntoaster oven and pizza oven.\n\nAnd that means if you were on the surface\n\nof the Earth that day, you were dead.\n\nNow if that happened in today's world,\n\nit would surely be calamitous.\n\nBut a lot of humans are underground, they work underground,\n\nthere's tunnels underground, there's subways,\n\nthere are defense facilities underground,\n\nso, certainly, some humans would survive that day.\n\nWe'd probably be in a Mad Max situation for some time.\n\nWhether we pull out of that or not, who knows?\n\n@Brrrtje writes, How strong is the evidence\n\nfor an alternative hypothesis for the dinosaur extinction?\n\nWell, I would say, weak at this point.\n\nThere are other hypotheses\n\nthat have been out there for decades.\n\nFor example, maybe volcanoes wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nWell, that sort of thing\n\ntakes hundreds of thousands or millions of years,\n\nand it would unfold gradually around the planet,\n\nand it doesn't look like the instantaneous extinction\n\nthat we see in the fossil record.\n\nSome people have said,\n\nWell, the dinosaurs weren't doing so well\n\nleading up to the extinction,\n\nso they really died of multiple causes.\n\nAnd, A, we have no evidence that they weren't doing well.\n\nWe don't have that kind of resolution in the fossil record.\n\nAnd actually, it looks more like they were doing great\n\nand their biodiversity was flourishing.\n\nBut to say that they died of multiple causes\n\nwould be something like saying,\n\nBob had a cold and he got shot by a bazooka,\n\nso he died of multiple causes.\n\n@Smudgey90 90 asks, What stopped dinosaurs\n\nreemerging as the dominant species after the meteor event?\n\nWell, death. Death is hard to come back from.\n\nBut, birds tried. We call birds avian dinosaurs.\n\nA flamingo or a hummingbird is a dinosaur to the same degree\n\nthat a stegosaurus or a triceratops is.\n\nWe have certain anatomical features\n\nthat you have to have to be considered a dinosaur.\n\nAnd if we go back to the very first creature\n\nthat satisfies those criteria,\n\n237 million years ago,\n\na fossil found in Africa that we call Nyasasaurus,\n\n100% of that species' descendants,\n\nthat's the group that we call dinosaurs.\n\nSo when I say that dinosaurs went extinct\n\n66 million years ago, what I'm really talking about\n\nis the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nBut some avian dinosaurs survive until today.\n\n@SwenRoschlau asks, Would human evolution,\n\nthe evolution of higher intelligence,\n\never been possible without this mass extinction event?\n\nOr would it have taken a different course?\n\nI think it would've almost certainly\n\ntaken a different course.\n\nEarth history is so contingent.\n\nIf you run the the movie of life on Earth back,\n\nit never turns out the same way twice.\n\nIf you can imagine\n\nthat asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs,\n\nwell, that formed the same time the solar system did\n\nfour and a half billion years ago.\n\nGo out to the asteroid belt at that time\n\nand hit that asteroid with a piece of popcorn,\n\nand then 66 million years ago, it doesn't hit the Earth.\n\nAnd our mammalian ancestors\n\nduring the entire reign of the dinosaurs,\n\nwere little, tiny, nocturnal shrew-like creatures\n\nliving in the hidden and forgotten recesses\n\nof the dinosaur world.\n\nThey could never really get anywhere\n\nuntil the dinosaurs went extinct.\n\nAnd then the dinosaurs went extinct and almost immediately,\n\nearly primates evolve,\n\nsome mammals return to the sea, they become whales,\n\nsome mammals become big predators, big herbivores.\n\nNone of that happens,\n\nI think including intelligent species such as us,\n\nwithout the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nA Reddit user asks, 99% of all living things\n\nthat ever lived on Earth are now extinct.\n\nFact or fiction?\n\nIt's fact-ish.\n\nWe don't know the exact percentage,\n\nbut certainly the vast, vast majority\n\nof creatures that ever lived,\n\nsomething approaching 99% have evolved,\n\nthey've persisted for some amount of time,\n\nand then they went extinct.\n\nExtinction is a natural process,\n\nbut it generally happens gradually over geological time,\n\nnot in rapid succession, as is happening today.\n\n@Sangkancilguru opines,\n\nPandas are so bloody useless, they deserve to go extinct.\n\nWell, that's pretty judgy there, Guru.\n\nPandas have a place in this world just like we do,\n\nand they fulfill a role in their ecosystem.\n\nAnd pandas, like every creatures,\n\nhave an unbroken chain of ancestry\n\nstretching back 3.8 billion years\n\nto their microbial forebearers.\n\nThis is a lineage that's survived all five mass extinctions,\n\nincluding the one that wiped out the dinosaurs,\n\nbut they're having trouble surviving us.\n\nSo what does that tell you?\n\nLynne Irwin wants to know,\n\nHow did cockroaches survive\n\nthe dino-killing asteroid strike?\n\nWell, have you ever tried to kill a cockroach?\n\nIt's not that easy.\n\nCockroaches are small,\n\ntheir needs are meager, and they can get underground,\n\nand that is a formula for success.\n\n@Rnadeau12 writes, What will cause the extinction\n\nof life on the planet next time?\n\nVolcanoes erupting, asteroid impact, sunspots,\n\nor developing fatal diseases in a lab?\n\nWell, here's what we know from history.\n\nThere have been five past mass extinctions,\n\nand every one was caused by a climate crisis.\n\nThe last, a climate crisis caused by an asteroid impact.\n\nWe are experiencing a sixth extinction right now.\n\nWe're not quite at the levels, obviously,\n\nthat happened when the dinosaurs were wiped out,\n\nbut the rate of extinction that's happening right now,\n\nif it persists, will cause Earth's sixth extinction.\n\n@Yaboy asked, What if there was a mass extinction\n\nso big it wiped away all evidence of anything being there?\n\nWell, there was actually a time in early Earth history\n\ncalled the Age of Bombardment\n\nfour and a half billion years ago\n\nto 3.8 billion years ago,\n\nwhen there was still a lot of debris in the solar system.\n\nAnd so planet sterilizing impacts happened commonly.\n\nIt might well be possible\n\nthat microbial Earth got started several times,\n\nbut was wiped out by asteroid bombardment,\n\nand that wouldn't leave a record that we would ever find.\n\n@Stigmatronic writes, The whole concept\n\nof the sixth mass extinction is bogus for the most part.\n\nAnd you know what, Stigmatronic?\n\nI appreciate your skepticism.\n\nThat's essentially the basis of science.\n\nBut we have data for the assertion that a sixth extinction\n\nis underway right now.\n\nThe background extinction rate of vertebrate animals\n\nover the last 2 million years\n\nis to lose about nine species per century.\n\nWell, just in the last century,\n\nwe have lost 615 species of vertebrate animals.\n\nSome people think the rate might be\n\nas much as 100 times higher than the normal background rate.\n\nIf you look at not species,\n\nbut populations of wild animals today, this is shocking.\n\nSince 1970, there are 69% fewer wild animals on the land.\n\nIf that doesn't concern you, if that doesn't make you think\n\nthat a sixth mass extinction is underway,\n\nI don't know what data you would need then.\n\n@Lizwei34 asks, Why, WHY,\n\nare they attempting to bring back the woolly mammoth?\n\nAfter six full 'Jurassic Park' movies,\n\nmy brain cannot fathom how anyone\n\nwould possibly think this is a good idea.\n\nMY GOSH.\n\nA lot of people conflate recent creatures,\n\nlike the woolly mammoth, with dinosaurs.\n\nDinosaurs are truly ancient. Their world is gone.\n\nThat's 66 million years ago.\n\nMammoths were around only 3,300 years ago.\n\nMammoths lived in a world that had the great pyramids,\n\nthat had written stories, that had beer.\n\nThat's this world today.\n\nAnd they had an important place in an ecosystem\n\nthat still exists today.\n\nAnd so if we could bring back creatures,\n\nparticularly ones that are the keystone species\n\nin their ecosystems,\n\nmeaning species that lots of other species depend upon,\n\nthen that would be a good thing for our environment,\n\nfor our ecology,\n\nand it also has carbon sequestration ramifications.\n\nSo in some cases, it could be a partial answer\n\nfor the climate crisis as well.\n\nI happen to be on the Board of Scientific Advisors\n\nof Colossal Biosciences\n\nendeavoring to de-extinct the woolly mammoth,\n\nand the Tasmanian tiger, and the dodo.\n\nIf there was a species that was on the brink today,\n\nif there were say only two of them left,\n\nlet's say those two animals died and it's two days later,\n\nwould you say, No, they're losers in Earth history,\n\nwe're done with them,?\n\nProbably not, right?\n\nWell, what if it was a week, or 10 years,\n\nor 100 years, or 1,000 years?\n\nI kind of have a Pottery Barn philosophy on this,\n\nwhich is if you break it, you bought it.\n\nI think if we're the agents of their demise,\n\nwe have a moral and ethical responsibility\n\nto resurrect them and their ecosystems.\n\n@Dangerous-Hotels-7839 writes,\n\nHave there been animals that were hunted to extinction\n\nby other animals and not humans?\n\nThere are lots of examples.\n\nFor example, in Hawaii today,\n\nexotic egg-eating snakes\n\nare wiping out many bird populations.\n\nIn New Zealand, house cats, which are not indigenous,\n\nare wiping out ground nesting birds.\n\nRats are one of the things\n\nthat push the dodo to extinction in Mauritius.\n\nIn the fossil record, when we see land masses connect,\n\nthat often leads to extinction.\n\nOne of the things that caused\n\nthe worst mass extinction ever,\n\nthis happened about a quarter billion years ago,\n\nwe call it the Great Dying, we think was caused by\n\nthese giant volcanic fissures in Siberia,\n\nbut it was exacerbated by the fact that all the continents\n\njust happened to bump into each other at that time,\n\ncreating the super continent called Pangaea.\n\nWhen all the land masses are connected to each other,\n\nthen all the animals have to compete with the other animals,\n\nand it's very hard on life.\n\nWhen land masses are fragmentary,\n\nwhen you have lots of islands and little continents,\n\nthen there's lots of little niches\n\nthat different species can occupy,\n\nand that usually leads to an increase in biodiversity.\n\n@BridgetHowell writes, 'Species of least concern'?\n\nWhat does that mean? It sounds so sad.\n\nIt means that they're not threatened,\n\nand threatened includes vulnerable, endangered,\n\nand critically endangered,\n\nwhich is the worst category to be in.\n\nSo least concern just means\n\nthat the population is fairly stable.\n\nAn example of a species of least concern\n\nwould be the laughing gull.\n\nThey're all over the country really.\n\nThey're doing just great, they love being around humans,\n\nthey love eating your hot dogs and your popcorn on the beach\n\nand they're doing just fine.\n\nA critically endangered species\n\nwould be something like the northern right whale.\n\nThere's probably only about 25 of them alive in the world.\n\n@SaintFiasco asks, What are the five mass extinctions?\n\nThe first one that happens is at the end of\n\nthe Ordovician period around 400 million years ago.\n\nLife is confined to the oceans at this point,\n\nand most of that is in the shallow seas.\n\nContinents are drifting south.\n\nIt initiates a glacial period.\n\nThe sea level drops,\n\nso it drops off of these shallow shelf areas\n\nand it's just habitat loss,\n\nand so we have a mass extinction event.\n\nLife recovers,\n\nand then we're in the Devonian period after that.\n\nThat seems to be a combination of climate change\n\nand bad ocean chemistry.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence of anoxic water,\n\nwater that doesn't have enough oxygen in it\n\nbecause it produces these black shale deposits\n\nin the Devonian, and so we have that mass extinction.\n\nAnd then the third mass extinction,\n\nthe worst of all, is called the Great Dying.\n\nIt happens at the end of the Permian period\n\nabout 250 million years ago.\n\nThat is the result of these giant volcanic fissures\n\nin what is now Siberia,\n\nbelching forth immense quantities of greenhouse gases,\n\ncausing the planet to overheat,\n\njust like is happening today.\n\nThat in combination with Pangaea forming,\n\nmaking all the animals have to compete\n\nwith all the other animals, it was really tough on life,\n\nand we lose about 95% of species.\n\nWe lose these little guys. This is known as a trilobite.\n\nThey almost look like underwater bugs,\n\nbut they evolved about a half a billion years ago,\n\nand they were super successful\n\nfor about a quarter billion years.\n\nBut then by the end of the Permian period,\n\ntheir immense run across deep time is over\n\nand they go extinct.\n\nAnd then we go into the Triassic period,\n\na really hard time for life on Earth,\n\nthe world is recovering from this Great Dying event.\n\nAnd then those volcanic fissures in Siberia,\n\nthey open up again, causing another mass extinction.\n\nAnd then after the Triassic,\n\nwe really get into kind of the sweet spot\n\nof the dinosaur age.\n\nWe're in the Jurassic period now. Things are going great.\n\nDinosaurs are getting big, they're getting biodiverse.\n\nWe get into the Cretaceous period,\n\nthat's kind of the flower of the dinosaur world\n\nand dinosaurs are cosmopolitan.\n\nThey're in all kinds of niches,\n\nthey're are all kinds of sizes,\n\nand then an asteroid hits and murders them,\n\nand it's over that day.\n\nAnd then we get into the age that we are in now,\n\nthe last 66 million years,\n\nthat becomes the age of mammals,\n\nonly because the playing field was cleared by that asteroid.\n\nAnd now what's happening now, we are causing the beginnings\n\nof the world's sixth mass extinction.\n\n@Throwawaysimples writes the trolling question,\n\nI think deforestation is a good thing. Change my view.\n\nWell, Throw Away Simples, how do you like breathing?\n\nBecause most of your oxygen comes from plants.\n\nThe Earth has two great lungs,\n\none is the phytoplankton in the ocean,\n\nthe other is really the Amazon rainforest.\n\nRainforests such as the Amazon,\n\nalso have the highest biodiversity in the world.\n\nAnd where do you think your medicines come from?\n\nWell, they come from discoveries made from plants,\n\nand animals, and microorganisms,\n\nthat mostly live in tropical rainforests.\n\nSo if you like not dying of horrible diseases,\n\nyou should be pro-forest.\n\n@Realmfoster says,\n\nI don't understand why sharks have to exist.\n\nWell, there's really no why in evolution.\n\nThere's no forethought.\n\nAnimals exist because they happened,\n\nand sharks happened a long time ago.\n\nSharks were around a couple hundred million years\n\nbefore the dinosaurs.\n\nThey persisted through the entire reign of the dinosaurs.\n\nThey survived the mass extinction\n\nthat wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nAnd obviously, they exist today.\n\nBut you know what they're having trouble with? Us.\n\nThere's a lot of sharks\n\nthat are critically endangered right now\n\nbecause they're being over-fished\n\nand because their environments are being destroyed,\n\nsuch as the great hammerhead shark, which is endangered.\n\nAnd they are the apex predators\n\nin many of the ecosystems in which they live,\n\nand predators are important.\n\nIt keeps actually the prey populations healthy\n\nbecause it winnows out the ones that are diseased,\n\nthat could spread those diseases through the population.\n\nIt causes natural selection, which causes the prey species\n\nto become faster, stronger, quicker.\n\nAnd so we really need sharks in this world.\n\nOkay, that's it. That's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something. Until next time.",

                "text": "Transcript\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHey guys.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nHello.\n\nYes, I'm WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs,\n\nand I'm thrilled to be joined today by the CEO\n\nof the hottest social network of the moment, Jay Graber.\n\nBefore Jay was the CEO of Bluesky,\n\nshe founded a social platform\n\nand she also was vital to the development\n\nof the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash.\n\nSo she's done a real tour of Silicon Valley activities\n\nand yeah, it's gonna be great.\n\nThanks for being here.\n\nThanks for having me, Kate.\n\nYeah, so I joined Bluesky about a year ago,\n\nand at the time it was still invite only\n\nand it was, you know, really, really popular\n\namongst a certain community,\n\nbut recently it's completely exploded\n\nand grown exponentially.\n\nHow many users are on there now?\n\nWe crossed 24 million recently.\n\nAmazing.\n\nAnd since it's grown so much,\n\nI'm curious if you can explain to anyone\n\nwho is still unfamiliar with the platform,\n\nwhat distinguishes Bluesky from its competitors?\n\nYeah, so Bluesky's really focused on user choice.\n\nWe try to give users a choice in their experience,\n\ndevelopers the freedom to build,\n\nand creators the ability\n\nto own their relationship with their audience.\n\nAnd so the way that we do that\n\nis it's built on an open network underneath.\n\nAnd that means that there's lots of experiences\n\nthat you can have on Bluesky.\n\nYou can customize your feed, you can control what you see,\n\nyou can control how other people interact with you.\n\nThere's a lot of tooling under the hood for that.\n\nAnd so that means that it's a better experience for people\n\nand ultimately that's what we're trying to provide.\n\nAnd, you know, it is a crowded playing field\n\nand you are emerging as like a new star.\n\nI'm wondering why do you think, you know, it was,\n\nthe world was so ready for innovation in this space?\n\nYeah, well social has gotten kind of stagnant\n\nover the years.\n\nWhen you have really strong network effects\n\nand people feel like they can't leave\n\nand there's no alternative,\n\nthen innovation kind of comes to a halt.\n\nAlso, the social companies have closed down the ability\n\nfor developers to build on them.\n\nAnd so stuff that used to happen,\n\nlike people building, you know, TweetDeck back in the day,\n\nstuff like that, doesn't really happen anymore.\n\nAnd so what we've done is opened that back up again.\n\nSo developers are building new things\n\nand users are coming in and finding out that,\n\nhey, you can do things differently here.\n\nYou can have a model of a social network\n\nthat lets you be social again\n\nand isn't, you know, having a for-you feed\n\nthat just shows you what the algorithm wants you to see.\n\nThere's the ability for you to go in\n\nand search for whatever you want,\n\nsee whatever you wanna see,\n\nand if you can't find it, you can go build it.\n\nI really, really appreciate that the search bar\n\ndoesn't say anything about AI.\n\nI thank you for that.\n\nIs there anything that, you know,\n\npeople, developers, or other people in the Bluesky community\n\nare doing that's especially exciting to you?\n\nYeah, there's a lot of stuff that's been built\n\nthat's really cool and that we're seeing for the first time.\n\nOne of them is starter packs.\n\nSo people are using this tool we built\n\nto connect with each other.\n\nAnd so if you want to bring your friend on, you can add,\n\nyou know, your hundred most recommended accounts\n\nor however many you want to a starter pack\n\nand then give that link to your friend\n\nor even put up a QR code and give that to people.\n\nAnd so that means that people\n\nare able to find their network very quickly.\n\nThe other thing people have done is\n\nthey've built tons of custom feeds.\n\nAnd so that means that if you are just looking\n\nfor maybe cat pictures today, that's all you wanna see.\n\n[Kate] I, that's usually me.\n\nYeah, you can search for that\n\nor you can just install a feed\n\nthat just shows you cat pictures.\n\nPeople have built multiple of these.\n\nAnd so this gives people a way to customize their experience\n\nmore than they've ever been able to do before.\n\nThat is amazing.\n\nAnd I think there was a QR code showing a starter pack.\n\nHopefully you guys all held your phones up and got that.\n\nBut, yeah, it's, I love the starter packs.\n\nThat's kind of, I know WIRED has one.\n\nYeah, there we go. There we go.\n\nSo, one of the parts of Bluesky\n\nthat I've been really curious to see how it develops,\n\nis, you know, for a long time Twitter\n\nhad verification badges\n\nand that helped journalists, and government officials,\n\nand celebrities, and people who might be impersonated,\n\nor might otherwise just really wanna prove\n\nthat they are who they say they are.\n\nYou know, the verification badges were sort of the way\n\nthat most of the major social networks\n\nwent about offering that service.\n\nRight now on Bluesky, the verification process\n\nI honestly find con kind of convoluted.\n\nEven though I'm a WIRED writer and I should be tech savvy,\n\nI really struggle to understand how to verify myself\n\nbecause you have to put your own domain name,\n\nyou have to register.\n\nI'm not even gonna do a good job explaining it,\n\nbut it's kind of complicated.\n\nAnd as you're scaling up, I'm wondering, you know,\n\nare you starting to think of other ways\n\nto verify accounts that are perhaps simpler?\n\nWhat is your plan there?\n\nYeah, this has actually been a topic of discussion\n\non the network this week,\n\nbut I can back up and explain the verification\n\nthat we do have right now,\n\nwhich is intended to put user control front and center.\n\nAnd so that is the custom domain name system.\n\nSo if you are the New York Times, you know,\n\nyou can have that just be your domain, right?\n\nWIRED I think is also, you know, their own domain.\n\nAnd so that means that you're able to\n\nshow whoever owns this website\n\nis the person behind the account.\n\nAnd so that means, you know, even senators\n\ncan get a senate.gov domain\n\nand only a person who controls the senate.gov domain name\n\ncan give that to people.\n\nSo this is a way for organizations or well-known websites\n\nto self-verify without needing someone in the middle,\n\nlike us, to do that.\n\nBut that is a little bit complicated.\n\nWe have the ability for you\n\nto actually buy your own domain name through us,\n\nbut that's not necessarily what everyone wants,\n\nparticularly people already have their own domains.\n\nIs is buying your own domain name a profit center for you?\n\nIt's something that we actually just put out\n\nto try to make it easier for people\n\nbecause that way you don't have to set it up yourself.\n\nAnd also people like shorter usernames.\n\nAnd so, you know, everyone has a bsky.social\n\nif you don't have your own custom domain.\n\nAnd so if you just want like, I don't know, jay.com,\n\nI could buy that and then have that as my username.\n\nAnd so it creates a shorter link,\n\nshorter handle you can have.\n\nBut the way that we're talking\n\nabout exploring new ways of verification,\n\nand this is being done sort of in the open on GitHub,\n\non the network people are chatting about it,\n\nis putting out some form of verification\n\nwhere we will be one verifier\n\nand then others can verify as well.\n\nAnd so, because again, going back\n\nto this being an open network,\n\nthat means that, you know,\n\nwe could verify some organizations,\n\nsome people have some process for that,\n\nmaybe display a badge or something, you know.\n\nWe haven't come to a final conclusion on this yet,\n\nbut then other folks could do that as well.\n\nAnd so you could have other organizations,\n\nother people out there\n\ndoing their own verification processes.\n\nAnd then as a user you can decide which you want to trust.\n\nAnd so,\n\nif you wanna trust Bluesky's check mark system, you can,\n\nthat'll probably be a default,\n\nbut if you wanna install a different one\n\nor, you know, use a different version of it,\n\nyou can go and search for that.\n\nAnd so that means that the trust is ultimately rooted\n\nin what you as the user want to see\n\nas the verification system you believe in.\n\nSo Bluesky itself wouldn't be verifying\n\nthe other verification systems.\n\nThe app is always able\n\nto do some amount of customization over like, you know,\n\nwhat things we recommend.\n\nSo, for example, we have tons of feeds,\n\nwe have tons of moderation services,\n\nand we might recommend some\n\nbecause these have been around for a while.\n\nThese are more trusted.\n\nBut over time I think people, including us,\n\nstart to build up trust in the systems that work best.\n\nAnd so, you know, one that just popped up last night\n\nprobably won't be at the top of the search results\n\nand people won't be using it a lot.\n\nBut if there's, you know, a credible organization behind it\n\nwhere a lot of people are using it,\n\nthen that'll rise to the top.\n\nGotcha. Okay, very interesting.\n\nWIRED might have to start up its own verification service.\n\nSo Jay and I actually talked\n\nfor the first time last February,\n\nand one of the most memorable things she said to me\n\nwas that she was determined that Bluesky\n\nwould not become inshitified with advertisements.\n\nYes. [audience members clapping]\n\nA lot has happened since then though.\n\nYou know, I don't think,\n\nI've always been a fan of this service,\n\nbut I didn't expect it to take off in the way that it did\n\nin the past few months.\n\nYou've scaled in a way that is really unique\n\nand at the same time you've also, you know,\n\ntaken some venture capital investments.\n\nI just can, I can imagine\n\nthat there's more pressure than ever\n\nto figure out ways to be profitable.\n\nI'm wondering, you know,\n\nhow are you gonna be profitable\n\nwithout inshitifying the platform?\n\nYeah, I mean our goal from the start has been to make sure\n\nthat our incentives end up aligned with users\n\nand the people who've built this ecosystem.\n\nAnd so the ways that we're moving into monetization is,\n\nas we announced recently, starting with subscriptions.\n\nBut we're gonna go into, you know,\n\nexploring some other avenues here.\n\nOne of the things we really believe\n\nis that money follows value.\n\nSo we've started to, you know,\n\na lot of the effort we've put in is just showing\n\nthat there's value in having an open network\n\nand being able to build on it\n\nand other people can participate in that.\n\nSo people building feeds, building moderation services,\n\nbuilding the things that are, you know,\n\nmaking this a valuable ecosystem.\n\nAnd so our goal in moving into that\n\nis to build some network services,\n\nthings that, you know, developers can tap into,\n\nyou know, users can tap into.\n\nAnd, you know, not necessarily going to go into great detail\n\non all this right now,\n\nbut like subscriptions are the first step.\n\nAnd then from there we're gonna explore things that like,\n\nkeep our incentives aligned with the ecosystem.\n\nAre you going to roll out subscriptions soon?\n\nThat was the plan, but we've had a lot of growth recently\n\nand so right now it's a bit in flux.\n\nYeah, what has been, you know, the hardest part\n\nof growing at this rate?\n\nWell, we have a pretty small team.\n\nWe have 24 million users and a core team of 20 employees.\n\nAnd so we're focusing on scaling,\n\nwe're focusing on making sure\n\nthat it remains a good experience as we scale\n\nand really delivering the features that, you know,\n\nbecome urgent as, you know, new types of users come on\n\nand new types of problems arise.\n\nLike you mentioned, verification was something that,\n\nyou know, we've, from the start,\n\ntalked about open ways to do verification\n\nthat allows other people to participate in the process,\n\nbut that's sort of need for it now\n\nhas accelerated those discussions.\n\nGotcha.\n\nOne thing that a lot of people have brought up to me\n\nwhen I've told them that I'm gonna interview you\n\nis, you know, since Bluesky has exploded in popularity,\n\nthere are certain groups of people\n\nwho are really, really taking to the network.\n\nJournalists are one of the groups, you know.\n\nJournalists, I think, we're all so overjoyed\n\nto have a place to post links to our stories\n\nthat doesn't throttle them,\n\nthat we're like just beyond thrilled.\n\nThere has been this major exodus from X\n\nin the wake of the election,\n\nbut also even prior to the election,\n\na lot of people had issues\n\nwith the way that Elon Musk was running it.\n\nSo there's a large influx of people\n\nwho basically share a worldview, share ideologies.\n\nYou know, I'd say most people would agree\n\nthat right now the majority of people using Bluesky\n\nare liberal.\n\nAnd I've had a lot of conversations with people\n\nwho really like the app but are worried\n\nthat it's just never going to reach a network effect\n\nof bringing in people that aren't liberals,\n\nbringing in, you know, people from the right,\n\nyou know, people are worried\n\nthat it's just gonna be an echo chamber basically.\n\nAnd I'm curious if you are worried about that.\n\nLike I could see a world in which you'd just decide\n\nthat that's the lane that you're in\n\nand you're gonna stick with it,\n\nbut then that obviously limits growth.\n\nBasically I'm asking like, do you want all the people\n\nthat are still on X to come join Bluesky?\n\nDo you want people who are far right to be on Bluesky?\n\nLike what, what is your hope for what the user base\n\nis gonna look like going forward?\n\nWell, at the end of the day,\n\nwe set out to change the way social media works\n\nfrom the bottom up.\n\nThat's why we built on an open protocol,\n\nthat's, you know, how we got started.\n\nAnd so our goal is to build this for everyone.\n\nBluesky's for everyone.\n\nWe have the ability for people\n\nto create the spaces that they want.\n\nAnd even now,\n\nthere's actually lots of Blueskies within Bluesky\n\nbecause you're able to create so much customization.\n\nAnd so the way this works is we just try to give the users\n\nas many controls as possible.\n\nSo whoever, you know, posts a thread has controls over,\n\nyou know, what happens in that thread to some degree, right?\n\nBecause we're thinking about this as your Bluesky account\n\nbeing like your own blog.\n\nIt's actually similar,\n\nbecause you actually can host your own data,\n\nyour own account, on your own service if you want.\n\nAnd so just like a person who puts up a blog post\n\ncan go in and, you know, have some control\n\nover their comment section,\n\nthe person who posts a thread\n\non Bluesky, on your micro blog,\n\ngets to have that kind of control.\n\nAnd then if somebody is, you know, quote posting you\n\nand you wanna get outta this conversation,\n\nyou're not feeling it, you can remove yourself\n\nfrom those quote-posts.\n\nAnd so that means that, you know, some people say,\n\nwell this starts to create an echo chamber\n\nbecause you're not, you know, listening.\n\nBut actually there's just a lot of ways\n\nthat social media has gotten a bit tiring\n\nfor a lot of people\n\nbecause you can't necessarily get out of the conversations\n\nyou don't wanna be in\n\nunless you completely stop using the app.\n\nAnd so our goal is to get things to a point, you know,\n\nwith the way that we're building this app\n\nthat people have controls over\n\nhow they wanna spend their time online.\n\nAnd so you can go in and design a experience\n\nthat is just quiet posters and mutuals,\n\nif you really want that.\n\nAnd that's just-\n\nWhat's a quiet poster?\n\nYeah, so those are actually feeds that people have built\n\nthat mean that it just shows you posts\n\nfrom people you follow that don't post that often.\n\nSo maybe you have that friend\n\nthat uses social media like once a month\n\nand normally they'll get drowned out\n\nin the people who are posting every hour\n\nand you would never see their posts.\n\nBut if you go into that feed, then you're seeing the people\n\nwho, you know, who have just posted over the past few weeks\n\nor the past month and you catch up on that.\n\nAnd then the mutuals are people who\n\nI follow you and you follow me,\n\nand then I like to hear from the people who I already know\n\nand like, that's the conversation I wanna be in.\n\nAnd then if you wanna go dip in\n\nand see what's going on in the broader world,\n\nyou can go to say the Discover feed\n\nor the Politics and News feed,\n\nand check in on everything going by,\n\nmaybe participate in those conversations\n\nand then, you know, swipe away from that\n\nor uninstall them when you're done\n\nwith that kind of a conversation.\n\nAnd so that means that the people who come on here\n\nstart to be able to design the spaces that they want.\n\nDo you think then in that way\n\nthat people will be able to design experiences\n\nthat they want,\n\nbut that means they'll be able to exclude, you know,\n\nseeing posts that they don't wanna see?\n\nDo you think that that's gonna basically put a limit\n\non how much Bluesky can ever sort of simulate a town square?\n\nThere's the spaces where those kinds\n\nof broad town square discussions are happening as well,\n\nbut following our philosophy of just giving users control,\n\nI think it's up to the user what they want to see.\n\nBecause I think when people don't wanna participate\n\nin that kind of discussion,\n\nthey just don't use that app anymore.\n\nOr they withdraw to, you know, a text message group\n\nor a discord group or someplace where they feel\n\nlike they can be having the conversations\n\nwith the people that they want,\n\nand then they come back when they want to,\n\nyou know, talk to strangers\n\nabout all the stuff happening in the moment.\n\nWe want to make it possible\n\nto talk about everything happening in the moment,\n\nall the broader conversations going on,\n\nand have that be going by.\n\nAnd then you can dip in and out of that stream as you wish.\n\nAnd the ability to link to stuff,\n\nas you mentioned really easily,\n\nand follow through on those links, is another part of this,\n\nwhich is just seeing Bluesky as being a gateway\n\nto the open web.\n\nWe wanna make social more like the web again.\n\nAnd so that means that, you know,\n\nyou can click through, like we love links.\n\nWe want you to be able to, you know,\n\ngo through to where people are having conversations,\n\nnot even just on the app,\n\nbut if you're going to go, you know,\n\nread that news article and then comment on it,\n\nYour personal Bluesky experience when you're designing it,\n\nwhat are you prioritizing?\n\nAre you going, you know,\n\nare you treating it more like discord situation?\n\nAre you going for these mutuals and quiet posters?\n\nLike what, what are, what's your ideal, you know,\n\nscroll through Bluesky look like?\n\nI actually do both\n\nbecause I wanna catch up on what's going on\n\nand there's actually a Catchup feed\n\nthat shows you the most popular posts in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnd so I like to go through\n\nand see what everyone else has been talking about,\n\nlike get the vibe of the network that day\n\nand then see what the Discover feed shows me.\n\nBut then sometimes I actually do\n\ngo into the quiet posters or mutuals feed.\n\nThere's also one I really like called the Moss feed,\n\nwhich is just like forest pictures\n\npeople have taken on their hikes\n\nand because it's picking the stuff up in an automated way\n\nfrom everything people post,\n\nthese are people who, you know, maybe a new user came on\n\nand just posted a picture of a hike\n\nwith a mossy rock or something.\n\nAnd it's just like stepping out of the stream\n\nof all the broader conversations for a moment\n\nand just visiting a quiet corner of the network.\n\nAnd then, you know, I don't spend all day on there,\n\nbut then I go back to what else is going on,\n\nmaybe make a post.\n\nAnd so that's within my experience of the app,\n\nI can have these different corners of it for myself.\n\nI'm definitely gonna check out the Moss feed.\n\nI love a bog.\n\nIt's one of my favorites.\n\nYeah.\n\nFive years from now, where do you want Bluesky to be?\n\nI want to change the way social works.\n\nI want us to have choice over what we see,\n\nto have an open marketplace of different algorithms,\n\ndifferent timelines.\n\nI want us to have lots of people participating\n\nin building moderation services.\n\nSo these questions about how social media is moderated,\n\nwho controls what you see, gets placed back in users' hands,\n\nin developers' hands,\n\nand in the hands of anyone who's interested\n\nin helping improve the situation, right?\n\nLike civil society organizations,\n\nacademic researchers who have ideas\n\nfor how social could be different.\n\nI had a talk recently with some folks\n\nwho are exploring pro-social algorithms.\n\nSo how do we get people\n\nto have better conversations with each other,\n\nmaybe from different perspectives\n\nor different parts of political spectrum\n\nthrough the ways that we build the algorithms actually.\n\nSo instead of highlighting the most outrage\n\nor the most engagement generating things,\n\nwhich aren't necessarily\n\ncausing people to change their minds,\n\nbut maybe actually driving them further apart.\n\nWhat if we build things that find the commonalities\n\nand bring people together?\n\nAnd those kinds of experiments\n\ncan be done on Bluesky right now\n\nbecause those researchers can build a feed,\n\nspin it up, get users to try it,\n\nand they don't have to go lobby a company for change\n\nor lobby regulators for change.\n\nThey can just experiment with what if we just change\n\nthis app that's giving us the ability to get our hands in\n\nand start, you know, making changes right now.\n\nI would love to test one of those algorithms out someday.\n\nOkay, we don't have that much time left,\n\nbut I do need to ask you about something.\n\nSo I was talking\n\nto our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, earlier,\n\nand she's a big Bluesky fan too.\n\nAnd I was talking about something that I had skeeted\n\nand she like visibly recoiled\n\nand she doesn't like the phrase,\n\nand if you guys aren't aren't familiar,\n\nBluesky's user base basically took it upon itself\n\nto call what you put out into the feed a skeet\n\nIt's kind of a play on a tweet\n\nand it doesn't have any other meaning.\n\nSo, you know, and now that you're blowing up,\n\nlike are we sticking with skeet?\n\nI have always called them posts.\n\n[audience and Jay laughing]\n\nI maintain that they are called posts\n\nbecause when we set out to do this,\n\nwe were not trying to invent new words,\n\nand we were building a protocol.\n\nSo there's gonna be other apps, there are other apps,\n\nthere's other things people use\n\nand not all of them are going to call posts the same thing.\n\nOn the other hand, this is very user-driven\n\nand, you know, the ecosystem evolves as it will.\n\nSo I'm gonna keep calling them posts.\n\nThe Bluesky app, when you go to post something\n\nsays post and quote post,\n\nbut there's other apps out there\n\nthat have called them skeets.\n\nDo you have a favorite post?\n\nLike one of those that\n\nuse rent free- My, yeah,\n\nLike is there any, is there any,\n\nI was gonna say do you have a favorite skeet,\n\nbut I'll call 'em posts.\n\nLike, is there a platonic ideal of a Bluesky post\n\nthat you look at and you think like,\n\nYeah, I did a good job.\n\nLike what's your favorite skeet?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWell the one that sprang to mind\n\nis somebody made a joke about vitamin water\n\nthat I still remember,\n\nand they said, you know, Oh, it's vitamin water.\n\nWhat vitamins does it have in it?\n\nPink.\n\nAnd that's how I feel about vitamin water,\n\nbut I still love it.\n\nSo I don't know why I thought of that,\n\nbut that's one of the ones I like.\n\nThere's just a lot of posts like that\n\nthat go by and make me laugh.\n\nNo, I'm honestly very, very impressed\n\nthat you came up with one on the spot\n\n'cause I didn't tell her I was gonna ask her that.\n\nThat is all the time that we have.\n\nBut, Jay, thank you so much for joining us and-\n\n[Jay] Thank you.\n\nEveryone should get a Bluesky account.\n\n[audience applauding]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, thank you all for being here today,\n\nto echo what Katie said.\n\nI'm so excited to be talking with Meredith Whittaker.\n\nMeredith is the President of the Signal Foundation,\n\nwhich for those who don't know overseas and runs\n\nand maintains the Signal Messenger,\n\nwhich is an encrypted messaging app and platform\n\nthat is used by hundreds of millions of people globally.\n\nAs far as WIRED's concerned,\n\nthe gold standard in encrypted messaging,\n\nwe all use it, recommend that you do too.\n\nBut Meredith also co-founded the AI Now Institute at NYU,\n\nwhich focuses on the social implications of AI and tech\n\nand spent over a decade at Google,\n\nwhich I think is also especially relevant\n\ngiven what we're talking about today, which is the idea of,\n\nit says surveillance capitalism.\n\nOh, it did.\n\nThe name of the talk Does it.\n\n[Brian] Where? is about\n\nsurveillance capitalism, if you check your program,\n\nif there's a program.\n\nBut I think we wanna draw a little bit of distinction there\n\nabout what we're really talking about today, Meredith,\n\nwhich is more of a surveillance business model\n\nthat has kind of defined the last couple of decades of tech.\n\nYeah, well, it's great to be here with you, Brian,\n\nand thank you everyone.\n\nI think, you know,\n\nas someone with a bit of an academic background\n\nwho really pays attention to definitions,\n\nthis is just a clarification I often make,\n\nsurveillance capitalism is an more or less academic term\n\nthat is very freighted with sort of disciplinary histories.\n\nAnd when we at Signal,\n\nwhen I talk about the surveillance business model,\n\nwe're being a bit more diagnostic and a bit more, I think,\n\nschematic about what we're talking about.\n\nUltimately, Signal exists in an industry\n\nwhere the profit incentive is defined by surveillance,\n\nand that's not a scary term.\n\nIn this case, we're talking about data collection.\n\nYou collect as much data as you can\n\nabout whatever your domain is, your customers,\n\nyour environment, what have you.\n\nYou use that to create models, to target ads, perhaps,\n\nor to train AI models or what have you.\n\nOr if you don't do that, you provide goods and services,\n\ntool chains and libraries to those who do.\n\nSo there's a flywheel,\n\nthere's sort of a center of this industry\n\nthat is defined economically\n\nby the collection and creation of data\n\nwith this sort of the more, the better paradigm.\n\nAnd in Signal's case, we reject that out of hand,\n\nof course, because we are motivated and dedicated\n\nto preserving privacy, to creating technology\n\nthat maintains the hundreds of thousands of years of,\n\nyou know, private communications as a norm\n\ninto an age where privacy is vanishingly scarce\n\nin our daily lives and communities and activities.\n\nSo when we talk about the surveillance business model,\n\nwe are talking about a paradigm\n\nwithin which Signal both exists and which it rejects.\n\nAnd I think what we see here\n\nis Signal almost as the acid test for what's wrong\n\nwith the current incentive structure in tech,\n\nwhen something as valuable as Signal\n\ncan't figure out how to make a profit.\n\nWhen we can be core infrastructure for human rights work,\n\nfor journalism, for every military in the world,\n\nif we're gonna be frank, for governments, for boardrooms,\n\nwhen it's clear we are the gold standard\n\nfor a value that everyone cares about.\n\nThe Apple Billboards proclaiming privacy,\n\nMeta's sort of turned to privacy.\n\nThis is something,\n\nit is clear there is a market for and people want,\n\nand yet we have to squeeze ourselves into a nonprofit shape\n\nthat is not quite conducive\n\nfor the high availability realtime tech\n\nwe are maintaining and developing,\n\nsimply because there's no real way to make a profit\n\nin the tech industry given the surveillance incentives.\n\nSo I think that introduces\n\nwhy we focus on that paradigm so much\n\nand kind of the distinction practically speaking\n\nbetween how we use it\n\nand how it might be used in different academic discourses.\n\nWell, and I think that is the central question, right?\n\nIs you are presenting a model\n\nof how to do things differently\n\nand beyond just messaging,\n\nbut you are providing the messaging, a messaging model\n\nand then maybe other people can follow that.\n\nBut I think what's interesting\n\nand why I'm glad to talk to you\n\nis that it's not just hypothetical,\n\nyou are currently making it work\n\nand you genuinely have this sense that things are changing.\n\nYou wrote for WIRED in an essay\n\nthat we published a couple weeks ago,\n\nNext year will be big tech's finale.\n\nDo you feel like we are at a sea change?\n\nDo you feel like we are that close\n\nto things unwinding for big tech or, you know,\n\nis that a little more hyperbolic\n\nand it takes a little more step,\n\na few more steps to get there?\n\nYeah, well, look, y'all asked me in the middle of 2024\n\nto write a prediction for 2025, like, you know,\n\npast data does not necessarily predict a volatile future.\n\nAnd what I really wanted to write was,\n\nyou know, like I sat down and I thought,\n\nwell, what is there to be optimistic about right now, right?\n\nLike, how do I actually\n\nsort of sincerely communicate optimism?\n\nAnd what I came to is, well, you know,\n\nlet's write something that is half manifestation\n\nand half optimism as invitation, right?\n\nThat's not a prediction where we say,\n\noh, it looks like, you know, probability approaching one,\n\nwe can all sit back\n\nand let the gears of the world take shape.\n\nNo, this is an invitation to action\n\nand to marshal the forces that I do truly see fomenting\n\nin which I have never seen a broader\n\nand more heterogeneous coalition\n\nlooking at concentration of power in tech,\n\nlooking at the deep dangers of pooling vast dossiers\n\nof surveillance data on every person on earth\n\nin the hands of a few companies,\n\nlooking at these choke points and single points of failure\n\nwhere, you know, one bug and a kernel driver\n\ncan take down core infrastructure globally across medicine,\n\ntransportation, governments, you know, what have you.\n\nLike, none of those things are chill or nice.\n\nNo one is championing them,\n\ncertainly not in the way they were 10 years ago\n\nor even five years ago,\n\nso, you know, the first step to a strategy for change\n\nis an honest map, and that's what I think we have now.\n\nNo one is pretending this is okay.\n\nAnd so that is the opportunity\n\nand the invitation for change.\n\nAnd again, to take things like Signal,\n\nwhich is, you know, we're existing as a nonprofit.\n\nWe exist on donations.\n\nWe persevere at being kind of the keystone species\n\nin the tech ecosystem around privacy and tech\n\nthat is rights preserving and works with integrity,\n\nbut we're not looking to be alone, right?\n\nWe don't wanna be the outlier that proves the rule.\n\nWe want to be a new set of rules\n\nleading the way to a much more open\n\nand diverse tech ecosystem that,\n\nagain, isn't reliant on like,\n\nyou know, 5 companies and 15 guys\n\nin a paradigm that is very, very stale,\n\nand ultimately not healthy for the world or the future.\n\nWell, and I wanna talk about Signal and how it is,\n\nyou know, it is ubiquitous,\n\nespecially among the privacy conscious.\n\nBut that ubiquity is expensive, right?\n\nSignal cost about $36 million to run last year\n\nand about 50 million to run now, which is a pretty big jump.\n\nAbout two thirds of that,\n\nby my understanding at least in 2023,\n\ncame from contributions.\n\n[Meredith] Is that? It all came\n\nfrom contributions.\n\n[Meredith] All, okay. It's fully\n\ndonor supported. So as you grow,\n\nthings get more expensive, you need more donor support\n\nto fund all of this, these features, these servers,\n\nhow sustainable is that?\n\nDo you feel like you're on a flywheel right now\n\nwhere as you grow the donations grow in kind\n\nor does there need to be another model that steps in\n\nthat makes you sustainable for the long term?\n\nWell, I mean, it's kind of a,\n\nit's a bit of a tricky question\n\nbecause it's sustainable right now\n\nbecause there are a lot of people who value privacy\n\nand who get why what we're doing is so critical, right?\n\nLike, one thing to take home, we couldn't make Signal again\n\nif the heartbeat stopped, right?\n\nIf Signal went away for a year, you can't just restart\n\na globally interconnected communications network\n\nwhere you can pick up your phone\n\nand knew your friend also has it installed on their app.\n\nThat network effect is huge, it is not replicable.\n\nAnd when Signal came up over 10 years ago\n\nwhen it emerged as two apps, then one app,\n\nand the sort of history of Signal\n\nand the masterful work of its founder, Moxie Marlinspike,\n\nwho basically carried this thing through for a decade,\n\nit was coming up in an environment\n\nwhere its competition was web clients.\n\nLike remember Jabber and Google Chat, right?\n\nIt was coming up in an environment\n\nwhere less than 30% of human beings had a smartphone.\n\nMost people left their desktop at their work\n\nwhen they went home.\n\nA vastly, dramatically different ecosystem\n\nthan what we have today where we have incumbent monopolies\n\nwho've saturated the market, right?\n\nAnd so we're talking about preserving something\n\nthat grew through the cracks into sort of a mighty tree,\n\nlet's use that metaphor,\n\nand needs to continue to be fed and watered\n\nbecause without that, you know,\n\nwe can't just snap our fingers and introduce tech\n\nthat will actually serve the purpose of Signal, right?\n\nBecause everyone has to use Signal for you to use it.\n\nYou can be the most, you know,\n\nthe most virtuosic cryptographer\n\nwho created the most elegant\n\nand beautiful private communications technology.\n\nYou go out there, you're like, hey, use it, right?\n\nBut if your friend doesn't use it,\n\nit doesn't matter to you, right?\n\nSo that network effect is hugely important\n\nand the reputation that Signal has developed\n\nbecause of the care and attention\n\nand sometimes agitation of the hacker and InfoSec community\n\nis equally important, 'cause we develop all in the open,\n\nour cryptographic implementations and our core technologies\n\nare open source, every change to our repo get scrutinized\n\nby like communities of dudes\n\nwho are like trained spotters for signal code pushes, right?\n\nAnd that like, we love them for it\n\nbecause they will find a little bug and they will report it,\n\nso it's really making good on the promise\n\nthat many eyes make more secure code.\n\nAnd again, that's, you know, similar to CUDA\n\nor some of the other standards and infrastructures\n\nyou might hear about in other sectors like AI,\n\nwhat we're talking about is a community of practice,\n\na community of labor norms, and a sort of,\n\nyou know, standardized understanding of tech\n\nthat has come through this, you know,\n\nSignal as infrastructure over about 10 years,\n\nand again, can't just be recreated, right?\n\nI can publish anything on GitHub,\n\nbut I can't force anyone to read it or care about it, right?\n\nSo these things are very, very precious\n\nand they need to be maintained.\n\nThey need to be supported,\n\nand right now we do have support.\n\nWe're looking to diversify that,\n\nyou know, now is a very critical moment for privacy,\n\npreserving communications.\n\nYou know, the more geopolitically volatile the world is,\n\nthe more it's important for us to be able to have real talk\n\nthat is not interrupted by surveillance.\n\nAnd so I think, you know,\n\nwe're working on growing the base of supporters\n\nand thinking through are there models\n\nthat can marshal the type of money we need, right?\n\nIt's absurd that we are a core infrastructure,\n\nyou know, from everything to human rights and defense,\n\nand then you see these companies\n\nthat are basically white labeling some like AI API\n\ngetting billion dollar valuations,\n\nand we can't figure out how to like make money on that\n\nto sustain a thing that if it went away\n\nwould literally change the fates of nations,\n\nlike y'all, right?\n\nWell, and can I, you wrote also,\n\nI know you wrote it a little bit ago, but about this idea\n\nof this nonprofit critical infrastructure ecosystem, right?\n\nSo not just Signal, but other aspects\n\nwhere we are too reliant on private companies.\n\nWhere's the, where's the nonprofit version of that?\n\nAnd as part of that,\n\nyou mentioned a need for state capital to get involved\n\nat some point.\n\nIs that when you talk about\n\nalternative and diversifying funding,\n\nis that something that Signal's looking at?\n\nAnd are there any concerns with that too\n\nabout taking money from governments\n\nthat you're also protecting people from with,\n\nyou know? Yeah,\n\nnone of this is simple friend.\n\nYeah, oh yeah, no for sure.\n\nLike what I'm looking at\n\nis there's the type of capital we need,\n\nhow do we get it?\n\nNot how do we partner with states, absolutely not,\n\nnot how do we sort of enter into shady agreements.\n\nI think there is, you know,\n\nthe issue here is not nonprofit or for-profit.\n\nNonprofit is a tax status,\n\nit's not actually like comfortable or amenable.\n\nLike we are constantly, you know,\n\nI feel like we're like fitting inside a dollhouse.\n\nWe're like a massive, you know, like tech,\n\nnot massive in size, but like, we have to maintain,\n\nwe have to act and function like a tech company.\n\nWe are for all intensive purposes a tech company.\n\nWe are a nonprofit tech tax structure,\n\nbecause again, that means that my board\n\nisn't gonna go to Davos\n\nor isn't gonna be pushed to have sort of,\n\nyou know, a profit motive come back to me\n\nand be like, I love you Meredith.\n\nI love this privacy thing real cool, real nice,\n\nbut ultimately I have a fiduciary duty\n\nand just as the board sold Twitter,\n\nour board is gonna have to strip some privacy protections\n\nbecause you have to be making some revenue, right?\n\nThat's the risk that we are warding against\n\nwith the nonprofit structure.\n\nWe are not celebrating nonprofit\n\nas some sort of alternative to private enterprise,\n\nand those are the two,\n\nyou know, the cage match there, right?\n\nThis is a structure that we have to have\n\nif we're gonna preserve our obsessive mission on privacy,\n\nbecause otherwise it would be whittled away\n\nbecause those dudes on my board\n\nultimately have no choice or they want an AI strategy\n\nor they're, you know, whatever, whatever.\n\nThere's a lot of ways we could make money\n\nthat we simply are not gonna make money doing\n\nbecause we're privacy preserving.\n\nSo the call here is not everyone come be a nonprofit.\n\nNonprofit is not the perfect form.\n\nIt is a prophylactic from the incentives,\n\nthe perverse incentives that define the industry we're in.\n\nAnd that, you know, how do we create better incentives?\n\nHow do we marshal things like state capital, which is,\n\nyou know, let's be clear\n\nthat's going to tech all day every day.\n\nIf you look at the subsidies,\n\nif you look at the research history,\n\nif you look at the massive cloud contracts\n\nthat are now ultimately the pipeline of revenue\n\nfor most of these companies, or a big pipeline of revenue,\n\nlike there's no state capital involved here.\n\nI mean, you look at their government sales departments\n\nin any one of these large companies,\n\nthey, you know, [indistinct] has a magnitude\n\nbigger than Signal's team, right?\n\nSo we also have to stop with these bright lines\n\nas if there's some, you know,\n\nclear I guess difference between sort of private industry\n\nwith state control, what have you, yeah.\n\nSo I think the question then is how do we marshal that,\n\nyou know,\n\nhow do we marshal state capital without state control?\n\nHow do you get long-term commitments, guarantees?\n\nHow do you do things like the sovereign tech agency\n\nin Germany, which was set up ultimately\n\nto take government appropriations,\n\nbut then has a lot of clear, a lot of clear boundaries\n\nwhere they independently allocate those\n\noutside of state control.\n\nSo we're, you know, we're interested there,\n\nbut I had to, I had to kind of go into a long digression,\n\nI think to explain what we're actually talking about,\n\n[Brian] which is not, It was a good one.\n\nnot a clean schematic, not a clean divide\n\nbetween for-profit\n\nand non-profit. Clean is boring.\n\nI think that was a really\n\n[Meredith] illuminating. Yeah,\n\nclean is boring. Yeah, right?\n\nWhile we're on the topic of governments,\n\nwe obviously had an election here in the US recently.\n\nDonald Trump, yeah. What, when?\n\nIt's true, it's true.\n\nRead about it on wired.com.\n\nIs that a website? It is, it is.\n\nSo, but I wanna talk to you about it.\n\nI think a, there's, well, the Trump administration,\n\nthe last go round was hostile to encryption,\n\nnot, you know, several governments worldwide are.\n\nYou've got Kash Patel coming in potentially as FBI director.\n\nHow does this affect Signal, its users?\n\nLike what is Signal's role in this moment?\n\nHow are you feeling about the incoming administration,\n\nboth for your users and for Signal itself?\n\nI mean, look, Signal knows who we are.\n\nSignal will continue being Signal.\n\nSignal has one thing we do and we do it really well\n\nand we do it pretty obsessively, and that is provide\n\ntruly private communications infrastructure\n\nto everyone everywhere globally, full stop.\n\nWe're not changing.\n\nThat's how I feel.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nIs Signal going to stay in the United States\n\nno matter what in terms of where it's based?\n\nI mean, we're a global, we're a global operation\n\nin so far as we, you know,\n\npeople use Signal everywhere around the world,\n\nacross the globe.\n\nWe're an open source project.\n\nWe have people who, you know,\n\nwe don't routinely take third party commits,\n\nand when we do, we scrutinize them really closely, right?\n\nBut we do have people who sort of,\n\nyou know, contribute to Signal globally.\n\nWe're a jurisdiction in the US and we don't, you know,\n\nwe don't have plans to share on that, but we are, you know,\n\nwe are not a globally interconnected communication network\n\nhas to touch as many people as possible,\n\nso you can make that call from like Bangkok\n\nto Kingston, Jamaica,\n\nand then make it from Kingston to London\n\nand then London to New York.\n\nSo, you know, we don't have any plans to move.\n\nWe are focused on markets around the globe\n\nand we are of course aware of the way that,\n\nyou know, geopolitical volatility\n\ninforms our ability to function in one or another market.\n\nWe've been fighting things like the online safety bill,\n\nNow Act in the UK, which threatened to,\n\nand still sort of threatens, but much more in the distance\n\nto mandate back doors in end-to-end encrypted communication,\n\nyou know, a disastrous cybersecurity vulnerability\n\nthat would ultimately undermine Signal anywhere it's used\n\nirrespective of jurisdiction.\n\nWe're fighting Chat Controls,\n\nwhich is the European version of that law.\n\nIt's sort of like this, it's this zombie that honestly,\n\nyou know, since 1976 when Diffie and Hellman\n\ntried to publish their paper\n\nintroducing public-key cryptography\n\nand the US government freaked out\n\nand tried to suppress publication of that paper\n\nhas been this sort of, you know,\n\never present specter behind the idea\n\nthat there could be private communication networks\n\nor other privacy preserving technology\n\nthat would protect interpersonal communications\n\nand activities,\n\nnot simply government or corporate activities.\n\nAnd this is a tension that threads\n\nthrough the crypto wars in the nineties\n\nwith the specter of evil\n\nthat encryption is said to be protecting,\n\nchanging over time, you know, it's terrorists,\n\nit's people who harm children, it's what have you.\n\nBut with the goal remaining steadfastly focused\n\nultimately on destroying the only technology we have\n\nto preserve the human right of privacy\n\nin an age of unprecedented mass surveillance.\n\nSo we fight that wherever it emerges.\n\nWith the time we have left,\n\nI want to talk a little bit about the future for Signal\n\non a product level,\n\nwhich it sort of feels less grand than,\n\nyou know, global fights against [indistinct],\n\nbut is fundamentally what it is, it is Signal itself.\n\nWhat I wanna ask is, as you grow out features you have,\n\nit feels more complicated\n\nbecause you have to build them out in a secure way\n\nwhereas your competitors do not,\n\nso it's more expensive, more timely,\n\nharder to keep parity in certain ways.\n\nWhat do you see as future, as Signal's future as a product?\n\nWhat's next on the roadmap?\n\nWhat do you care about, parity about?\n\nWhat do you not care about?\n\nWhich is really a way to ask about AI,\n\n'cause no one has yet, I get to be the first person today.\n\nEveryone's gonna do it, so I just, I get to do it here.\n\nWhat does Signal need to do to keep up with and expand\n\nand get to a billion users that it's not doing right now?\n\nWell, we have to provide a product\n\nthat when anyone picks it up, looks and feels normal,\n\nthat works, that when you wanna send\n\na cat dancing on a birthday cake to your auntie thread,\n\nyou can go to gift search\n\nand type in cat birthday cake dance\n\nand the right little thing will pop up\n\nand you send it to your aunties, right?\n\nIt has to do that.\n\nThat is fundamental,\n\nas fundamental as ensuring that our crypto systems\n\nare robust and not susceptible to attack.\n\nBecause again, if your friends don't use Signal,\n\nit doesn't matter how ideologically committed\n\nto privacy you are, you don't use Signal either,\n\nunless you know, I don't know,\n\nyou open it to send note to self,\n\nbut note to self is a great feature by the way.\n\nSo, you know, what we are aiming for\n\nis a product that just works,\n\n'cause no one picks up their phone to use Signal.\n\nThey pick up their phone to talk to their partner\n\nor talk to their dad or, you know,\n\nthe actual imperative of messaging\n\nis human relationships and connection,\n\nand so honoring those as a first order\n\nis what Signal has to do\n\non the same level as ensuring privacy preservation.\n\nAnd this is where I think,\n\nyou know, the early Signal team, Moxie, Tyler,\n\nsome of the people who are really at the founding\n\nof this product got it right where very few people did.\n\n'Cause there was a whole crop of sort of privacy preserving,\n\ncommand line looking, PGP looking, you know,\n\ntechnology that no one used.\n\nI was a person trying as hard as I could\n\nto get anyone I know\n\nto like email me back with PGP and crickets, right?\n\nNot because people didn't care,\n\nbut because ultimately when they wanted to talk to me,\n\nthey didn't wanna do that.\n\nAnd so from its inception,\n\nSignal has really focused on usability, on design,\n\nand on being extremely stringent about making an app\n\nthat looked and felt normative.\n\nAnd so we will continue doing that and I think,\n\nyou know, that means that we're doing something, you know,\n\nyou should see in the next months or so, encrypted backups,\n\nwhich is a, you know, that's a gap, you know,\n\nso you can back things up\n\nand if your phone falls in a river,\n\neverything isn't on device and lost, right,\n\nwhich is a, you know, a thing that we wanna do.\n\nIt's obviously much harder to do in a privacy preserving way\n\nwhere we have full deniability around,\n\nyou know, our ability to, you know, see people's data,\n\nbackups are tricky there.\n\nso we're looking at improving some of those gaps.\n\nI don't, you know, AI,\n\nwhat I see across a lot of these apps right now is a,\n\nI would say almost a glassy-eyed company imperative\n\nthat is coming down from the top\n\nto integrate AI into everything.\n\nAnd I can imagine how the OKRs get written,\n\nyou know, it's the year of AI and then your little VP,\n\nright, is like, Okay guys, it's the year of AI.\n\nIntegrate this into your group level or your product level.\n\nOkay, well then there's somebody here who has to take on,\n\nyou know, integrating an AI feature into this,\n\nbut like, that's not how good innovation happens, right?\n\nAnd that's why we have these little prompters,\n\nthese little like, Hey, let me write your mom for you.\n\nAnd I'm like, You don't need to write my mom.\n\nLike stop it, right?\n\nAnd so I think what we're seeing is like this,\n\nlike it's annoying at this point.\n\nIt is cluttered, it is swirly and swoopy and unclear\n\nand it doesn't actually solve a problem for me.\n\nThe problem it solves is AI takes vast amounts of capital\n\nin the bigger is better form we have,\n\nand there is a need for a consumer market fit, right?\n\nAnd they're trying, right?\n\nThey have people who are like,\n\nwell, they said, it's the year of AI.\n\nLet's try to shoehorn this into an interface\n\nthat ultimately would serve us better if it were cleaner,\n\nwould serve us better\n\nif it weren't cluttering up with suggestions\n\nand like little prompts, right?\n\nAnd so that's the thing Signal's not gonna do.\n\nAnd Signal doesn't have to, again, 'cause we, you know,\n\nwe didn't go out and invest a trillion dollars\n\nin data centers on a bet that this stuff was gonna,\n\nyou know, return as a good product feature,\n\nwhich is another benefit of kind of our model.\n\nSo we're laser focused on doing one thing\n\nand doing it very, very, very, very, very well,\n\nand when you know, something comes along\n\nthat doesn't serve that we don't have to pick up that mantle\n\nbecause we're not chasing quarterly returns.\n\nWe're not chasing sort of investor approval,\n\nyou know, to make sure that we continue with the valuation\n\nthat we'll, you know, keep our C-suite employed, right?\n\nAnd so, you know, we do use a little bit of AI\n\nand it's an on-device face detection model.\n\nIf you go to Face Blur feature,\n\nit works kind of half the time, it's fine,\n\nbut you know, again, when we talk about AI right now,\n\nwe're talking about these bigger is better\n\nsort of transformer models, everything is generative,\n\nand ultimately I think a lot of that is gonna fade away\n\nbecause it's not proving useful in a consumer context.\n\nMeredith, thank you so much.\n\nThat's all we have time for.\n\nI really enjoyed talking with you.\n\nI really appreciate it.\n\nThank you.

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHi Brian.\n\n[Brian] You want me to sit?\n\nYeah, you can sit down.\n\nWhile we're doing this,\n\nI'm gonna tell you just a little bit about Brian and Airbnb.\n\nI won't be long, but I will just say Airbnb,\n\n4 million hosts,\n\n1.5 billion guests\n\nacross more than 220 countries.\n\nPretty incredible.\n\nTransformed the entire travel industry, no big deal.\n\nVery happy to have you here\n\nfor our last conversation of the day\n\nbefore we have some drinks.\n\nAnd let me start by backing up,\n\nwhich is something I maybe tend to do in interviews.\n\nI apologize, I'm a linear thinker,\n\nbut I've been thinking a lot lately,\n\nfor reasons that are probably obvious,\n\nabout time in four year increments.\n\nAnd if you think back four years, 2020,\n\nthe world in the midst of a devastating pandemic\n\nand an event that for your company was,\n\nI mean, I will,\n\nthe word that comes to mind for me is existential, right?\n\nCatastrophic.\n\nI think you laid off at the time\n\nsomething like 25% of your staff.\n\nAnd yet here we are today talking about,\n\nor we are going to be talking about,\n\nthe evolution of Airbnb, what's next?\n\nSo I'm curious, from your point of view,\n\nI will not make you relive that whole experience,\n\nbut from 2020 to now,\n\nwhen you think about everything that has changed\n\nfor your company,\n\nwhat stands out?\n\nWhat are sort of like the big milestones\n\nor the big moments in Airbnb's,\n\nlike recent history\n\nfrom that really sort of like existential moment\n\nfour years ago,\n\nSo it was January, 2020,\n\nwe were working on our IPO\n\nand it was gonna be one of the big IPOs since like Uber.\n\nAnd I remember I was in a meeting\n\nand it was late January and we saw our business in China,\n\nwe had a business in China,\n\nand it fell off a cliff.\n\nIt dropped like 80%.\n\nAnd I said, what, what is this?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAnd they said,\n\nOh, there's this thing called the coronavirus.\n\nAnd I had never heard of it and probably none of you had\n\nbecause it hadn't made the front page of the newspaper yet.\n\nAnd I remember saying something kind of innocently like,\n\nwow, if if this thing spread beyond China,\n\nit would be really bad.\n\n[Interviewer] We would be real screwed. Yeah.\n\nAnd within eight weeks we lost 80% of our business.\n\n[Interviewer] That's so crazy.\n\nAnd to lose 80% of our business,\n\nand we were doing about $35 billion a year,\n\nso that was more than the sales of Starbucks,\n\nand when you're doing that much business\n\nand you lose almost all of it,\n\nit's like you're in a 18 wheeler,\n\nyou're going 80 miles an hour\n\nand then you slam on the brakes.\n\nThere is no easy nonviolent way that,\n\nlike everything just is smooth.\n\nAnd there were actually articles,\n\nlike Is this the end of Airbnb?\n\nWill Airbnb exist?\n\nAnd I think we were one of the,\n\nlike the tips of the spear of this kind of crisis.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nthere's nothing,\n\nlike I've thankfully I've never had\n\nlike a near death experience\n\nand I don't think we ever had\n\na near death business experience,\n\nbut we didn't know it at the time.\n\nAnd there's something about your business flashing\n\nbefore your eyes that makes,\n\ngives you a clarity that you don't have in any other time.\n\nAnd at that moment,\n\nlike I think that became the defining moment of the company.\n\nThe first thing we had to do is,\n\nwe had to like cut the company almost in half by size.\n\nWe did a layoff of about 25% employees,\n\nbut we also had a lot of contingent workers, contractors.\n\nSo we really lost about a third of the company.\n\nWe had to then go,\n\nI had to go through like a thousand different projects\n\nin the company line by line,\n\ncutting as many things as possible.\n\nAnd so it's like your house is on fire,\n\nyou go in a house and you can only take out\n\nlike a handful of things outta the house.\n\nThat is really, really clarifying.\n\nAnd I suddenly just changed how I operated,\n\nbecause I think I had been operating\n\nlike in a totally different way.\n\nSee I was told that like the way you should run a company\n\nis you should hire great people\n\nand you should just trust them\n\nand get outta their way to do their job.\n\nAnd that sounds nice on the surface.\n\nI don't think Jensen, who was just before me, does that.\n\nHe has 40 direct reports, I believe.\n\nAnd what I had done,\n\nwas I thought like,\n\nfounders are in the details\n\nand you are involved in all decisions\n\nand over time you step out.\n\nAnd that was the biggest mistake I ever did.\n\nAnd many of the founders\n\nand many of the leaders I've met,\n\nthe biggest mistake they make\n\nis they step outta the details.\n\nBecause what I've learned\n\nis that great leadership is presence, not absence.\n\nAnd that people can be empowered\n\nwith you being very involved,\n\n'cause you can actually put your entire weight behind them.\n\nAnd so I got really, really hands-on.\n\nWe made the company much smaller.\n\nWe felt like we wanted to be\n\nnot the Navy but the Navy Seals.\n\nWe went back to a functional organization,\n\nwe moved to like these release cycles\n\nwhere we started doing software updates,\n\nkind of like an operating system.\n\nWe almost started developing software like hardware\n\nbecause I felt like we were a free for all organization,\n\nwe were like divided into all these different divisions,\n\ngoing in a thousand different directions,\n\nand you open the app every year and you're like,\n\nwhy does the app look no different the year before?\n\nSo we really simplified, we got back to the basics,\n\ngot back to like,\n\nand the first thing we did is I said,\n\nalright, we're gonna expand beyond a core business,\n\nwhich I know you'll ask about,\n\nbut we have to have permission\n\nto expand beyond the core business.\n\nSo before we do new stuff,\n\nwe're gonna figure out all the things people don't like\n\nabout Airbnb and we're gonna start\n\nto address them one by one.\n\nSo people said prices are too high.\n\nSo we started working on,\n\nlike working on making Airbnb more affordable.\n\nPeople started saying like,\n\nwell the quality is not really good.\n\nSo we started working on a lot of quality issues.\n\nPeople said the app was too difficult to use,\n\nit'd become pretty much a Frankenstein of an app\n\nbecause you had all these different teams\n\npushing code every hour, every day.\n\nThere was no cohesive vision.\n\nSo we started focusing on that\n\nand over the last three years,\n\nwe do these releases twice a year,\n\none in May, one in November,\n\nthe entire company rose in one direction.\n\nWe have this two year roadmap.\n\nSo we look out two years,\n\nalmost no other software company does that,\n\nand we've made over 535 features in upgrades and fixes,\n\nthe service is by no means perfect,\n\nbut the results are today the company is stronger than ever\n\nand a company that people thought was going outta business\n\ndoes more money as a free cash flow,\n\nas a percent of revenue,\n\nthan almost any company in Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd I think this really just comes back to this,\n\nyou know, quote that Andy Grove, you know,\n\nhe was CEO of Intel, he said,\n\nA bad company's destroyed by a crisis.\n\nGood companies survive a crisis,\n\nbut great companies are defined by a crisis.\n\nAnd I always wanted the pandemic to be our defining moment,\n\nand I think it probably was.\n\n[Interviewer] Fantastic.\n\nSo you're now in this position\n\nwhere you've effectively sort of rebuilt\n\nand reoriented Airbnb and you're right,\n\nI am gonna ask you about moving beyond the core business.\n\nYou've launched some really interesting features\n\nrelatively recently, right?\n\nLike the icons program is one,\n\nwhere you can stay in all sorts of wild\n\nand crazy different places.\n\nYou recently launched a co-host program\n\nand I noticed I'm taking my daughter\n\non a trip in the spring,\n\nI can't tell you where because she doesn't know yet,\n\nbut when I booked the trip on Airbnb,\n\nall of these different experiences came up,\n\nwhich is the experiences program,\n\nlike make cheese with this person, go drink wine,\n\nwhich she's young,\n\nwe're not gonna go drink wine with anyone,\n\nbut it genuinely did to me as a user feel like,\n\noh there's like something different is happening here\n\nand now I'm on stage with Brian Chesky\n\nand I can ask him what it is and where it's going.\n\nWhere is this all taking us in terms of Airbnb,\n\nthe core business,\n\nhow we think about it now, you go,\n\nyou book a room or you book a place to stay on vacation\n\nor a business trip,\n\nwhere are we headed?\n\nSo when we started Airbnb\n\nand it originally took off,\n\nI thought we would like expand beyond housing.\n\nI thought we could take the Airbnb model, you know,\n\npeople were saying like the Airbnb for this,\n\nthe Airbnb for that.\n\nThere was an entire ecosystem of startups\n\nstarted around this kind of idea.\n\nAnd I thought that we were gonna do that.\n\nAnd we tried to do it in the early, the 2000 teens,\n\nlike 2014, 15, 16.\n\nAnd it was a little premature.\n\nWe were still in hypergrowth, we weren't really ready.\n\nAnd then of course the pandemic occurred\n\nand then we decided to get back to our foundation.\n\nSo I've looked at a couple companies for inspiration,\n\nmaybe one company that is a decent\n\nreference point is Amazon.\n\nAnd we're a pretty different culture than Amazon, you know,\n\nwe're probably closer in our product development philosophy\n\nto Apple than Amazon,\n\nbut the business that Amazon had in the late nineties,\n\nit was a bookseller\n\nand the only thing you could buy on Amazon was books.\n\nNow books are not nearly as big a market\n\nas vacation rentals.\n\nYou were approaching a hundred billion dollars a year.\n\nBut because books isn't a very big market,\n\nthey had to go into other adjacencies very, very quickly.\n\nAnd so baked in the early days of Amazon\n\nwas what do they do after books?\n\nThey did DVDs and they needed CDs\n\nwhen people used to buy those.\n\nAnd then they moved on and on and on\n\nand eventually they sold everything.\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nif we will sell everything on Airbnb,\n\nbut I think one day you'll be able\n\nto Airbnb a lot more than just an Airbnb,\n\nand you know, we're gonna, you know,\n\nwe don't really disclose ahead of time what we're gonna do,\n\nbut the one thing I've already said\n\nis we are gonna reimagine experiences.\n\nI think it's an underrated product.\n\nPeople generally like it,\n\nbut it never really like caught on.\n\nAnd I think that we can totally reimagine that product\n\nand I'm just like so excited\n\nbecause I very rarely,\n\nlike maybe here's a way of saying it,\n\nlike there are so many founders\n\nthat like they have this idea like,\n\nand if you're lucky, if you're lucky,\n\nyou have an idea and it just takes off.\n\nAnd I was 26, my parents are social workers,\n\nI didn't think I would have an app that ever took off.\n\nAnd my life completely changed.\n\nEverything about my life changed\n\nbecause of this rocket ship I went on,\n\nand I went on this rocket ship\n\nand there's been a couple other dozen people,\n\nif you've like how many people like me are there\n\nthat like go on this rocket ship, a few dozen,\n\nAnd you get to know them, they're at the same conferences,\n\nand you talk to them\n\nand then we all go through this like trough of despair.\n\nMost of us do.\n\nIt's almost like corporate adolescence.\n\nAnd it was probably almost as awkward as my real adolescence\n\nand only a few people,\n\nJensen before us, the greats,\n\nthey get to the other side\n\nand they get an opportunity to have a second act.\n\nThey get an opportunity to reinvent themselves.\n\nAnd that's what I hope next year is the beginning of Airbnb.\n\nI hope it is.\n\nI hope people say that that was one\n\nof the biggest reinventions of a company in recent memory.\n\nReinvention is a big word to use. I'm bookmarking that.\n\n[Brian] Reinvention. That's an aspiration.\n\nI'm gonna be checking in on this.\n\n[Brian] That's an aspiration.\n\nFantastic.\n\nI saw you speaking earlier this year,\n\nit was an off the record session\n\nso I can't share what you said,\n\nbut you talked about sort of your theory\n\nof the case around the value of physical experiences\n\nand the value of physical community.\n\nParticularly in an environment where, you know,\n\nwe're spending a lot of time\n\ntalking about digital experiences, we're talking about AI,\n\nwe're talking about the intridification of the internet,\n\nwhich Jay Graber talked a little bit about earlier.\n\nCan you talk us through a little bit of sort of that,\n\nI mean obviously your company is very well positioned\n\nto capitalize on the resurgence\n\nof physical experience,\n\nbut just give me your,\n\nlike your thesis on that topic, briefly.\n\nLet me, yeah.\n\nSo very briefly, up until two years ago,\n\nvery few people were talking about AI\n\nand then of course Chat GPT launched\n\nand then the generative AI revolution basically started.\n\nAnd while it's been so exciting, I bet you very few of you,\n\nyour daily life has any differences because of AI.\n\nHere's a test, take your phone out,\n\nlook at all the apps in your home screen\n\nand ask what of them have changed two years later\n\nbecause of generative AI.\n\nLike truly changed.\n\nI doubt there are, other than using an AI native app,\n\nI bet you none of the apps you use,\n\nincluding Airbnb are fundamentally\n\ncompletely different in a world of AI.\n\nAnd then ask yourself,\n\nwhat did you do today that was different because of AI,\n\nzero I saw in the audience.\n\nWhat did you,\n\nwhat have you done today or yesterday\n\nthat changed fundamentally because of AI?\n\nMaybe some things,\n\nbut I think it leads to this bigger topic.\n\nI remember when the internet came out like,\n\nand I mean I was born in 1981,\n\nso my memories of the internet were like 1993,\n\nit was before search engines,\n\nand before search engines, some of you might remember,\n\ndo you know how you found a website,\n\nthere was a phone book\n\nand there was this like actual phone book\n\nwith these like websites\n\nand you would say, oh if I wanna learn about this,\n\nyou go to the phone book and you type in the browser.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is I feel like we are in\n\nthe like phone book stage of AI.\n\nWe are still that early\n\nand I think it is starting to begin\n\nto change our digital world,\n\nbut it has not yet changed the most important part\n\nof our lives,\n\nwhich is the physical world.\n\nAnd that's maybe one of the reasons\n\nwhy your life hasn't completely changed by AI\n\nis even when it does change on the phone,\n\nour physical reality is still exactly the same\n\nas it was before.\n\nAnd then the question is,\n\nwell when does the physical world start to change?\n\nOr when does the physical world\n\nstart to be enabled in a completely different way\n\nbecause of AI?\n\nAirbnb's kind of unique because like, you know,\n\nthere's this word that Silicon Valley uses, product,\n\nyou know, you have product managers,\n\nand product managers are basically software managers,\n\nproduct means software,\n\nwhat's our product?\n\nIt's not our app, it's the home, it's the experience,\n\nit's the wine tasting,\n\nit's all these things we're gonna be launching.\n\nSo I am so excited about what we can do\n\nand I think that like AI\n\nand all these different revolutions that are gonna,\n\nI mean certainly AI I think is gonna enable a lot more.\n\nAnd I think if you think about AI, like maybe in a stack,\n\nyou have what Jensen's doing,\n\nwhich is the GPUs on top of, that's the second layer,\n\nwhich is the LLMs.\n\nThere's been a lot of innovation,\n\nbut the world will change at the layer above that.\n\nAnd the layer above, that's the applications.\n\nAnd so when the apps in your phone are totally different,\n\nwe have reached the application layer\n\nand when we reach the application layer,\n\nthe world will completely change.\n\nBut it's kind of like AI is,\n\nthe infrastructure is like the highways.\n\nWe need to still build the cars.\n\nAnd 10 years ago everyone thought\n\nwe'd all be in self-driving cars right now.\n\nAnd there are a bunch on my street.\n\nBut there aren't a lot on a lot of streets.\n\nAnd so I think the point is,\n\nwe overestimate how much technology can change\n\nin the short term,\n\nbut we probably underestimate\n\nhow much it will change in the long term.\n\nAnd it is gonna take some time I think\n\nto permeate the physical world.\n\nBut once it does,\n\nI think it's gonna change everything\n\nand it's not gonna be limited to asking the agent something\n\nand getting an answer.\n\n[Interviewer] Interesting.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nI mean, yeah, I like this vision.\n\nNo it's really, it's interesting.\n\nI mean, is there other technological progress?\n\nI think one of the recurring jokes of this day\n\nis that every session,\n\nthe person in my chair asks the person in your chair\n\nabout AI, right?\n\nThere's a lot of-\n\n[Brian] It was like 1995 you'd say the word internet.\n\n[Interviewer] Right?\n\nYes or as Stephen Levy pointed out earlier,\n\nfive years ago it was the metaverse, right?\n\nIs there other technological progress,\n\nwhether it affects your company\n\nor whether it's just something you are seeing\n\nas a leader in the tech industry\n\nthat you think is really salient,\n\nthat you think is important,\n\nthat you think maybe has implications for Airbnb\n\nthat we are not talking about\n\nbecause we are spending so much time talking about AI?\n\nOr is AI really deservedly sucking up\n\nthis much oxygen?\n\n[Brian] I mean maybe the way to think,\n\nI mean there are so many different technologies\n\nthat will probably impact the world.\n\nMaybe the way to think about it is that AI will be enabler,\n\nyou know,\n\nI think that like one part of AI\n\nthat I think will be massive\n\nis when AI can do software development.\n\nBecause I think like right now,\n\nlike there are only so many people\n\nthat can like hire software engineers.\n\nLike a small ski company can't have a like a,\n\ncan't have an app,\n\nbecause they can't hire engineers.\n\nBut when software development\n\nbecomes much more like prompting,\n\nthen software can be completely ubiquitous.\n\nAnd as software's completely ubiquitous,\n\nthen suddenly the physical world can start to change,\n\n'cause everything could have software in it.\n\nAnd so that's just like a very small example.\n\nSo I think that AI is an accelerant.\n\nI don't know,\n\nI think a lot of times when we say AI\n\nand we say like AI is gonna change the world,\n\nI wonder if we're using AI,\n\nwe're really saying is technology,\n\nI wonder if we're just saying that technological progress\n\nis going to speed up\n\nand that the next 20 years are gonna feel like the last 50.\n\nAnd that probably is true,\n\nand it probably is in large part for AI,\n\nbut AI is built on a lot of other technologies.\n\nAnd so if AI is built on other technologies,\n\nthen wouldn't other new technologies emerge\n\nthat are built on AI that will also accelerate technology?\n\nAnd so I just think that there's gonna be a huge amount\n\nof technological progress.\n\nAnd I'm not like a,\n\nI'm a designer at heart, not a technologist,\n\nso I'm not probably the best person to ask\n\nwhat the specific technologies are.\n\nBut I think when we say AI,\n\nI think sometimes or AGI,\n\nthink we kind of mean technological progress.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah, yeah.\n\n[Brian] Make sense?\n\nI think AGI is at the center of it,\n\nbut it's gonna probably lead to the,\n\nthere's gonna be a lot of other developments.\n\nLike AI is only possible with like,\n\nprocessing power increasing and like, you know,\n\nlike AI is gonna lead to discovery\n\nof a lot of new areas\n\nand a lot of new fields that are gonna be self-reinforcing.\n\nYeah, no, it makes sense.\n\nWe have a few minutes left.\n\nI wanted to make sure to spend a little bit\n\nof time on your leadership style.\n\nI was telling you backstage\n\nthat of all of sort of the tech CEOs,\n\nthe leaders in this industry,\n\nI see Brian Chesky's name associated the most\n\nwith leadership advice tidbits of, you know,\n\nyou no longer believe in one-on-one meetings,\n\nit's founder mode, baby.\n\nLike, it's just,\n\nit's all this sort of noise about how you run your company\n\nand how you sort of have evolved as a leader,\n\nyour sort of theory of leadership.\n\nWhich brings me to the question,\n\nnot so much about leadership advice,\n\nI kind of wanna know what a day in the life\n\nof Brian Chesky is like,\n\nlike a work day.\n\nYou know, when you think about founder mode,\n\nsweating the small stuff, being in the details,\n\nnot sort of trusting,\n\nnot sort of delegating and operating\n\nin sort of manager mode.\n\nWhat does that look like every day?\n\nI ask as a manager and someone who really-\n\nThat's great question by the way,\n\nlike I love this,\n\nthis term founder mode has become pretty ubiquitous,\n\nand yet most like I know, Paul Graham-\n\nIt's not, you didn't say it.\n\n[Brian] It wasn't, Paul Graham said it,\n\nand he never actually explained what it was.\n\nAnd one time when it like first went viral,\n\nsomebody said,\n\nI'm going founder mode on this burrito.\n\nAnd yeah that was-\n\n[Interviewer] It's so good.\n\nThat was the moment I realized\n\nwe probably should clarify what this means.\n\nOtherwise, like I don't,\n\n'cause otherwise I feel bad for the burrito.\n\nYeah, it is a little bit threatening.\n\nI think it means a lot of things,\n\nbut just to be very simple, like at its crux,\n\nI think it means to be in the details.\n\nI think it means that great leadership is presence,\n\nnot absence.\n\nAnd I think a lot of us are taught to delegate,\n\nbecause the opposite of delegation\n\nis this horrible ill\n\nthat you can commit to on your employs,\n\nwhich is micromanagement.\n\nAnd no one wants to be a micromanager.\n\nNo one good wants to work for a micromanager.\n\nAnd I think it's way more nuanced than that.\n\nI remember there was an executive\n\nthat once asked me,\n\nIs this your decision or is this my decision?\n\nAnd I kind of exaggerated when I said this,\n\nbut I kind of said like,\n\nit should never be either.\n\nIn other words, everything is a dialogue.\n\nIt's a partnership.\n\nIt's not about me telling you what to do\n\nand it's not about you doing your own thing,\n\nit's about being involved.\n\nAnd the way I basically spend my time\n\nis I basically review the work.\n\nI basically say like,\n\nI don't like managers,\n\nand I put managers in quotes,\n\nmeaning people who manage the people absent the work.\n\nLike if you're not managing the work,\n\nwhat are you doing all day?\n\nAre you like doing one-on-ones?\n\nAre you acting like their therapist?\n\nAre you dealing with bureaucracy all day?\n\nAnd so I think the best way\n\nto manage people is through the work.\n\nAnd that's actually how they learn.\n\nThey learn by doing, by watching,\n\nand you mentor them through the work.\n\nSo what I do all day is I basically review work.\n\nSo like every day is a little bit different,\n\nbut I might wake up\n\nand like every Sunday night\n\nI have a head of program management at Airbnb,\n\nprogram management, unlike most companies,\n\nis a tier one function.\n\nAnd they basically,\n\nwe have 75 to 80 projects that I'm monitoring\n\nand I review every project\n\nand the company that's customer facing.\n\nAnd I review everything every week, every two weeks,\n\nevery four weeks, every eight weeks,\n\nthere's like a cadence\n\nand I'll probably do like 30 hours of reviews\n\nand maybe that's like approximately half of my schedule.\n\nI don't know exactly how many hours I work,\n\nMaybe some weeks I work more than that, but,\n\nand so I'll basically be in reviews.\n\nAnd so the reason I don't do one-on-one meetings,\n\nI mean if somebody needs to talk to me,\n\nI'll talk to them and I do a lot of calls.\n\nI'll call somebody and I'll ask 'em a question.\n\nWhat I don't do is recurring scheduled one-on-ones\n\nwhere the employee owns the agenda.\n\nAnd I find, I know Jensen said he doesn't do that either.\n\nAnd what I do is I basically run the company in groups,\n\ngroup meetings where I'm reviewing work\n\nand I have the boss, like the person doing the work,\n\ntheir boss, their boss and their boss.\n\nSo no one can ever have to go,\n\nno one ever has to go up the chain to get to me.\n\nYou could get to me in front of everyone\n\nand I'll ask everyone's opinion\n\nand then I might disagree with them,\n\nbut I'll like ask them to talk me out of it,\n\nchange my mind.\n\nAnd that's probably the main thing I do.\n\nIn other words, a simple way I run a company,\n\nis we have a release, a big product release,\n\nwe set a big goal\n\nand then we review the work every few weeks\n\ntowards that goal.\n\nAnd we're either on track or we're either off track.\n\nAnd if I'm not doing that,\n\nI'm probably trying to find great people\n\nto work on the next thing.\n\nAnd by hiring them, developing talent or promoting them.\n\nWho do you lean on as a leader? Who do you learn from?\n\nWho do you look up to?\n\nI mean, it changes,\n\nbecause when I was starting out I like,\n\nI think my investors,\n\nwhich were my board members,\n\ntaught me a lot.\n\nI had Reid Hoffman and Mark Andreessen on the board\n\nand you know,\n\nand then eventually Alfred Lynn\n\nand I had all these different people join the board\n\nand your investors are kind of like your mentors.\n\nThen I started learning from the executives I hired,\n\nI hired these executives and I learned from them.\n\nThen I started learning,\n\nI became like shameless about seeking out other CEOs.\n\nSo like I went to this conference called Sun Valley,\n\nall the like big shots of Silicon Valley were there,\n\nso I would,\n\nI like remember one time like there's this duck pond outside\n\nof Sun Valley and I like,\n\nit's like a pond with all these ducks,\n\nand I was chasing Jeff, not chasing,\n\nbut like trying to practically chase Jeff Bezos down\n\nto get advice from him in the duck pond.\n\nNo it's a good visual, let's go with that.\n\nAnd so I would, people like that,\n\nand now I, you know,\n\nlast night I had a dinner with like 20 other founders\n\nof companies like Airbnb size\n\nor maybe a little smaller,\n\nsome were a little bigger,\n\nand I do a lot of like,\n\nwe do a lot of comparing notes now\n\nand we were talking about like how we run our companies\n\nand I do look at like historical references.\n\nI think Walt Disney and Steve Jobs I like in particular\n\nbecause they were creative people\n\nrunning technology companies.\n\nI think of myself like that.\n\nSo those are kind of who I learn and lean on.\n\n[Interviewer] That's interesting,\n\ninteresting to hear about how it has evolved over the years.\n\nAnd speaking of time,\n\nwe are coming to the end of ours,\n\nand as you are the last speaker of the day,\n\nwe've asked a couple folks this throughout the day,\n\nbut parting words from Brian Chesky,\n\nwhat I wanna know\n\nand what I think you could leave everyone here with is,\n\nthat little bit of optimism I promised all of you\n\nat the beginning of the day,\n\nBrian, what gives you hope?\n\nWhat makes you feel optimistic?\n\nWhat can these fine people\n\ntake away from you today?\n\nOh, that's a great question.\n\nMaybe I can put it in the context\n\nof like what's happening in the world today.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nI don't know if people today in this world\n\nare super optimistic\n\nor that's, first of all,\n\nthere seems to be a lot of despair.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of pessimism.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of division.\n\nI mean, I remember when I came to Silicon Valley\n\nthere was another election going on, 2008.\n\nSenator Barack Obama against Senator McCain.\n\nAnd in hindsight they both looked a lot more purple\n\nthan the kind of red and blue divide of today.\n\nI mean, to give you an example,\n\nlike we sold collectible cereal boxes\n\nand we had like this Barack Obama themed cereal\n\nwith this John McCain theme cereal,\n\nyou know the outrage there would've been\n\nif we had like Trump and Harris cereal,\n\nlike both sides would've been completely,\n\nhow dare you make cereal by the other candidate.\n\nThat is how divided we are.\n\nAnd I'm like pretty concerned about that.\n\nBut I wanna bring it just back to Airbnb,\n\n'cause that's like kind of my only point of reference.\n\nWhen I started Airbnb with my two friends,\n\nI remember telling one of the first people\n\nI told about the idea\n\nand he looked at me with a straight face,\n\nBrian, I said, Yes?\n\nHe goes,\n\nI hope that's not the only idea you're working on.\n\nAnd the reason he said that,\n\nand it was, you know,\n\nlike a completely reasonable rational thought\n\nis he said strangers will never trust one another.\n\nThey'll never be able to do this.\n\nAnd I've learned since that day,\n\nmore than 2 billion people have stayed in the Airbnb\n\nand 220 countries and regions in a hundred thousand cities.\n\nAnd people have asked me,\n\nwell what have you learned about human nature\n\nbecause of these 2 billion people staying together?\n\nAnd I said,\n\nI think what I've learned\n\nis that at some fundamental level,\n\npeople are fundamentally good and we're 99.9% the same.\n\nAnd I think that we live in these echo chambers\n\nand these bubbles where we other everyone\n\nand we tend to identify as one group\n\nand then everyone else becomes the other group.\n\nAnd I think one of the best ways\n\nto change your mind about someone, I mean first of all,\n\nno one's ever changed someone else's mind\n\nin the YouTube comment section.\n\n[Interviewer] Not yet.\n\nI guarantee you, I guarantee you,\n\nhere's a way to change someone else's mind.\n\nLike have them walk in your shoes or walk in their shoes.\n\nAnd there's many ways to do that,\n\nand one way is, you know,\n\nobviously to be minorly solicitous,\n\nlike stay in Airbnb.\n\nBut we're not the only way.\n\nBut like get out into the world,\n\nmeet the kind of people you disagree with,\n\nand you'll start to realize\n\nthat they're not so different than you\n\nat some fundamental level.\n\nAnd when you start to believe that,\n\nand if you believe we're in the phone book era of AI,\n\nthat we're about to have the biggest engine\n\nfor curiosity and possibility in the world.\n\nAnd that technology can permeate the physical world.\n\nAnd if we can get out people back into the physical world\n\nconnecting back together with one another,\n\nI think that's the ultimate promise of the internet.\n\nThat the internet was always meant to bring us together.\n\nBut I think the physical version\n\nof bringing us together is in the physical world,\n\nwhy is everyone here physically here right now?\n\nYou could just watch YouTube videos,\n\nbut you all chose to come here.\n\nAnd I think that's what I'm optimistic about.\n\nI'm optimistic that I think this is maybe\n\none of the greatest times in human history to be alive,\n\nwith one of the biggest technological revolutions\n\nin front of us,\n\nand if we can just see besides our differences,\n\nwe can come together\n\nand I think we can create\n\nsuch a wonderful world together.\n\nAnd when I say world, I mean a real world,\n\na physical world that we can live in together.\n\n[audience clapping]\n\nI hope we see that come to pass.\n\nBrian, thank you so much.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you.\n\n[audience clapping]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nSo I'm really delighted to welcome Dylan Field\n\nto The Big Interview stage.\n\nHe's the co-founder and CEO of Figma.\n\nAs a student of Brown University,\n\nhe and his co-founder Evan Wallace began experimenting\n\nwith design tools built on and for the web,\n\nand with funding from a Teal fellowship,\n\nmaybe we'll talk about that, they began Figma.\n\nHis previous jobs were internships,\n\nincluding at LinkedIn.\n\nFigma has millions of users,\n\nthey run a big developer conference called Config,\n\nand lightly they've been very creative in integrating\n\nAI into their product.\n\nLike you had a choice, right?\n\nAnd welcome Dylan Field.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nSteven, WIRED, Thank you for having me.\n\nAnd also really great to be back here at Config,\n\nour first Config,\n\nwhich was just weeks before the pandemic,\n\nwas actually here at the Midway.\n\nAnd so it's very exciting to be back and good energy.\n\nWell, great to have you back, though.\n\nI have to say, I've got a comment on what you're wearing.\n\nYou are the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.\n\nWhy are you wearing an Enron hoodie?\n\nAll right, well, first of all,\n\none thing that people don't know enough of is\n\nthat the Enron logo was designed by Paul Rand,\n\nwhich I'm sure some of us know.\n\nPaul Rand was an amazing brand designer responsible\n\nfor many different corporate entities,\n\nincluding IBM, the NeXT Cube,\n\nand his last one actually was the Enron logo,\n\nand it was the final project he worked on.\n\nIt was released after his death.\n\nAnd you might say it had a short shelf life.\n\nIt went from what I think actually is a quite timeless logo\n\nto being called the crooked E.\n\nAnd one thing that happened yesterday,\n\nwhich I thought I got a real kick out of,\n\nwas somebody actually acquired the right to the Enron brand,\n\nand they did a relaunch on the anniversary\n\nof the bankruptcy.\n\nAnd to me, I kind of think this is fascinating\n\nbecause it brings up all sorts of questions\n\nfor a new generation\n\nthat didn't necessarily have all the associations\n\nwith Enron as others did,\n\ncan you actually make a new brand,\n\na new company out of that material?\n\nAnd for me, I was,\n\nI think it was 2001 when Enron went bankrupt.\n\nI was nine years old, I was reading the newspaper\n\naware that there's like really bad stuff happening,\n\naware that there are brownouts,\n\nbut I definitely don't have those same associations\n\nas a lot of others do.\n\nAnd I find the whole thing very fascinating.\n\nSo that's why I'm wearing the sweatshirt.\n\nSo in other words,\n\nyou're not getting the negative implications,\n\nof which there are some of Enron,\n\nbut it's just like a kind of a cool gangster thing,\n\nthat aspect of it.\n\nAttached to a logo which you bonded to there,\n\nis this always an appreciation of that stuff you had,\n\nbecause you were in college,\n\nyou were doing math and science.\n\nThen you get this fellowship\n\nthat basically tells people get out of college,\n\nbuild something.\n\nAnd you gravitate towards design.\n\nIs this something you were always interested in,\n\nor would you just see that as a gap, an opportunity?\n\nYeah, I was always interested in design.\n\nNot always very good at design\n\nbecause are two different things,\n\nyour taste versus your ability.\n\nThere's a lot of good famous quotes about that.\n\nBut for me, I mean,\n\nI was always fascinated with how things worked,\n\nthe user experience of things,\n\nand also graphics and how you actually could use interfaces\n\nonline and the web as well as desktop software.\n\nI grew up playing things like Incredible Tune Machine,\n\nthen eventually things like Neopets\n\nwere big influences for me in my childhood.\n\nAnd the design aspects of those\n\nand how they worked were endlessly fascinating.\n\nBut yeah, it took a while to get to Figma.\n\nI started the company because my co-founder\n\nand I were excited about WebGL.\n\nAnd we thought that that was definitely an opportunity,\n\nthe ability to use the GPU in your computer in the browser.\n\nAnd if we could start to do that, what could you make?\n\nWe thought there's really two things\n\nthat could be interesting.\n\nOne is games and the other might be tools.\n\nAnd we thought, okay, games is a hit-based business\n\nthat is incredibly hard to do the right way.\n\nWe're not gonna go there.\n\nInstead we said, Let's go explore the space of tools.\n\nAnd we started to explore,\n\nI'd actually just been a design intern at Flipboard,\n\nand they had an incredible design team there,\n\nand were really ahead of their time in terms\n\nof the premium they put on design.\n\nThey thought about design as part of something\n\nthat everyone in the company contributed to\n\nand was the reason that they stood out as a business.\n\nAnd despite that, it still took a while for us\n\nto get back to design because we thought\n\nit was a tiny market.\n\nAnd it turned out that the more we learned about it,\n\nthe more we looked into it,\n\nwe started to realize\n\nthat this was an exponential trend of not only\n\nhow much software is created in the world,\n\nbut also the importance of design in that context.\n\nAnd that design was the way that you stand out.\n\nAnd what's interesting now\n\nI think in this age of AI\n\nthat we find ourselves in is that it feels like\n\nthat's even more true than ever.\n\nBoth the exponential trend of software,\n\nI mean it's going straight vertical now,\n\nbut also this idea that craft of design being the way\n\nthat companies will stand out in this age of software,\n\nI think is more important than it's ever been too.\n\nAnd also the ratios, I think that when we started Figma,\n\nthe ratio of designers to engineers\n\nwere sort of off the charts.\n\nAnd that was much better than it had been 10 years prior.\n\nAnd we started to see improvements in those ratios\n\neven over the first five years of Figma.\n\nI think if you look to the future,\n\nit might be that the ratio flips even,\n\nthat there's more people\n\nthat are doing things that look like design\n\nthan people that are actually building the code.\n\nAnd so I'm fascinated to see\n\nwhat that'll look like in the future.\n\nWell, one of the pillars of Figma is\n\nthere's this paradigm of collaboration in design.\n\nNow Paul Rand, who you idolize,\n\nhe didn't have to collaborate with anyone.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs tried to stick his nose in\n\nto the process when he was doing the NeXT design,\n\nhe said, Get out of here.\n\nHe said, It's either take it or leave it.\n\nIf you don't like it,\n\nI'll take my $100,000 and go home.\n\nDid you have trouble pitching that\n\nto generations of designers who are used\n\nto that kind of data attitude?\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nThere's I think this mindset that agencies had\n\nwhere it was sort of,\n\nthere's a grand reveal and a black box\n\nthat the process is in.\n\nAnd when we launched Figma,\n\nI remember the comments were something like,\n\nIf this is the future of design, I'm changing careers.\n\nThat was one comment we got.\n\nAnother comment that always stuck with me was,\n\nA camel is a horse designed by committee.\n\nAnd what we've found is\n\nbecause design is so central to how a business works,\n\nand also if you win or lose,\n\nnot only does everyone have an opinion,\n\nand you could say, the more opinions, the worse it gets.\n\nBut I actually find that if you're able to make it so\n\nthat everyone can come together and see the best ideas\n\nand you can visualize them quickly,\n\nwhich I think will become more possible in the age of AI,\n\nthen you're able to kind of create a level playing field.\n\nAnd maybe for brand and marks\n\nlike Paul Rand created\n\nwhere you have to really be so strongly opinionated,\n\nthat's a different sort of beast altogether.\n\nBut when it comes to thinking through user flows,\n\nthinking through how a product experience should work\n\nand how a business should win,\n\noftentimes that really helps the strategy.\n\nSo what you said before\n\nlinks to something else that you've said,\n\nbecause creativity is the new productivity, right?\n\nCan you explain that?\n\nMy sense is that people are trying\n\nto visually express themselves much more than before.\n\nAnd also that there's a new paradigm possible\n\nwhen you've got an infinite visual canvas.\n\nAnd with an infinite visual canvas,\n\nwhether it's in a whiteboard tool,\n\nwe offer something called FigJam, or even in a slide deck,\n\nand we have Figma Slides now too,\n\nbeing able to show great visual work\n\ncan really help bring people along.\n\nAnd I think that the more creative you can be,\n\nthe more you can stand out,\n\nwhether it's inside of an organization\n\nor it's on the outside of an organization\n\nand in your marketing, your product,\n\nthe ways that you'll stand out to customers.\n\nSo if millions of people are using Figma,\n\nwhich they are, right?\n\nYou're not telling me how many millions,\n\nbut it's fair to say millions,\n\nthen if everything looks good, then how do you stand out?\n\nIsn't you raising the bar\n\nmaking it actually tougher to be distinct?\n\nYeah, I think that it's not just about how it looks,\n\nbut also how it works, of course.\n\nBut I believe that there's things\n\nthat the best designers are doing today\n\nin terms of interactivity, dynamism, motion,\n\nand just unique experiences that they're creating,\n\nwhich very few people are able to do.\n\nBut I hope that we can do two things.\n\nI hope that we can, partially with our tools,\n\nbut also partially with AI,\n\nand really they're the same thing.\n\nWe can lower the floor,\n\nmake it so that more people can participate\n\nin the process of design, but also raise the ceiling,\n\nmake it so that more people,\n\nwhether they're new to design\n\nor outside the world of design\n\nor they wouldn't classify themselves that way,\n\nor they're new designers can raise the ceiling\n\non their work.\n\nAnd they can make it so that they're able to match the work\n\nof some of the best designers in the world.\n\nAnd they're limited more by their ideas\n\nthan by the tools in front of them.\n\nSo Dylan, the first time we spoke,\n\nI know we had a great meeting\n\nand went out for coffee\n\nand you were telling me how\n\nI'm never gonna sell out this company,\n\nwe're gonna go it alone, we're gonna like build on that.\n\nAnd it was like maybe two months later,\n\nAdobe is gonna buy your company for $20 billion.\n\nI felt so bad when I told you that.\n\nI felt like,\n\nif you've ever had a one-on-one conversation with Steven,\n\nyou'll know how he stares into your soul.\n\nAnd I had just gotten off a call\n\nwith Adobe literally minutes before.\n\nWhat a poker player. Unbelievable.\n\nNo no no. I was petrified.\n\nI was like, did he hear? Anyway, I'm still sorry.\n\nOkay, well don't drop the subject.\n\n[Dylan] Just feel bad, that's all.\n\nI mean was this the kind of thing\n\nwhere you felt it's an offer I can't refuse?\n\nOr is it something you felt,\n\ngee, this is generally gonna be better for my customers\n\nand to grow what we want to do?\n\nYeah, I was honestly quite excited.\n\nI think it was something that to me,\n\nespecially as we explored it further,\n\nand that was still early in the process.\n\nAnd so I think we're going back and forth,\n\nbut I was excited about the possibilities\n\nwe could have inside of Adobe.\n\nWhat we could do there in terms\n\nof taking the multiplayer tech,\n\nthe way that we brought our product to the web\n\nand doing that for more of the Adobe ecosystem\n\nand the change we could create there.\n\nAnd I thought it was a good outcome,\n\nnot only for our customers,\n\nwhich honestly most negotiation was about\n\nhow to make sure our customers would end up in a great place\n\nand be beneficial for them,\n\nbut also for all the stakeholders around the company.\n\nSo yeah, I was excited and that's why we went after it.\n\nAnd obviously because regulators here and abroad\n\nsaid they were not gonna look kindly on this,\n\nthat went fizzle.\n\nAnd you're left with a company on your own again,\n\nyou have an extra billion dollars\n\nfor a breakup fee.\n\nBut I'm sure you had your plans\n\nand it was a distraction,\n\nbut then you get to concentrate on AI there.\n\nSo walk me through a little bit of your journey\n\nabout how you're building, you know,\n\nit's available now in open betas and things,\n\nAI into what you do.\n\nAbsolutely, so yeah,\n\nwe're wildly excited about just all the opportunities ahead.\n\nAnd I think that as we think about the future\n\nof Figma and what it can become,\n\nI mean we started off as a design tool where\n\na third of our users, weekly active users are designers,\n\nthird are developers,\n\nand third are kind of in the other category.\n\nAnd we found these folks were coming into the product\n\nand then we started to build out from there.\n\nWe created FigJam, we created Figma Slides, now Dev Mode.\n\nAnd we're really trying to make this platform\n\nwhere you can go and create products and do that end to end.\n\nAnd as I think about what AI enables through that,\n\nI get excited about these different transitions\n\nbetween abstractions.\n\nHow can you go from a brainstorm file to a slide deck,\n\nor a slide deck to a design file,\n\na design file to working code?\n\nThat becomes more possible in a world of AI,\n\nbut also the ability to improve\n\nthe way that you explore this idea maze.\n\nWe're all kind of in the design process\n\nthinking about all these different possibilities\n\nthat could exist.\n\nHow do you go rapidly navigate that?\n\nThink about the things that could be, evaluate them quickly,\n\nand then see if you wanna go down that path\n\nand really refine it and bring all the craft to it,\n\nor if you can discard that possibility.\n\nAnd if you could do that across that entire process quickly\n\nand bring those two things together, it's super powerful.\n\nAnd that's where I think you can,\n\nI guess both lower the floor but also raise the ceiling\n\nand make it so that in the sort of end state,\n\neven though there's so much more software in the world,\n\nthe software we have that stands out can be so much better.\n\nIt seems to me, the way I understand,\n\nand correct me if I'm wrong,\n\nthere's sort of two paths that you're pursuing on AI.\n\nOne is just to improve the flow,\n\nto use AI the way some of us will use ChatGPT\n\nto fill in things and automate certain kinds of things\n\nand just like make...\n\nAnd it's all once search through things you already have,\n\njust things that make it go smoother\n\nand take drudgery away.\n\nThe second is almost to build a collaborator\n\nto the creative process.\n\nAnd that's where things get interesting\n\nand a little questionable.\n\nLike where did this stuff come from?\n\nAnd you had one experience,\n\nyou had a product that\n\nmaybe you could explain it briefly,\n\nbut I mean, I don't know have we time to really get into it,\n\nultimately someone used something\n\nthat wound up looking a lot like Apple's weather app\n\nand you had to make an adjustment.\n\nSo rather than dive into that,\n\nthere is this gray area of whether people should contribute\n\nto the training sets.\n\nYou're transparent about that,\n\nbut some people wanna do that.\n\nThey want to contribute to the community.\n\nOther people are very protective. There's lawsuits.\n\nSo where you stand on that?\n\nDo you feel that we're gonna be a blend of the creativity\n\nthat comes from this cloud\n\nof what comes from training sets and us,\n\nor will people draw firmer lines as this goes along?\n\nSo it's interesting\n\nbecause when we launched this Make Design feature,\n\nwhich we later called First Draft\n\nbecause we thought that was more representative\n\nof the actual value that we were creating,\n\nthis is the first draft that you're gonna iterate on,\n\nwe did it in a way that was more generic.\n\nAnd what we found in the feedback we received\n\nwas actually design companies have a design system already.\n\nThey have a system that they rely on\n\nof a kit of parts of all their styles,\n\ntheir components that they want to use.\n\nSo they don't want an arbitrary thing.\n\nAnd what they do want from us\n\nis the ability to quickly explore\n\nand make variations using their own design system.\n\nSo I think first of all, most likely,\n\na lot of those outputs on the generative side\n\nare more unique to companies and organizations\n\nthan they are matching the general universe of design.\n\nBut it is important to be able to do all sorts\n\nof other functionality as well.\n\nAnd I think where training comes in is making it\n\nso that we're able to explore that.\n\nThings like if you're in Gmail for example,\n\nand you start typing and you see auto-suggested text\n\nand you can press Tab to complete it,\n\nlike what's the design tool equivalent of that?\n\nWhat makes it so that you can remove drudgery,\n\nthe things that people don't want to do,\n\nand put people into more of a flow state,\n\nmake them more creative\n\nand make it so that they can explore\n\neven more options faster?\n\nIf we can do that, then that I think is really exciting.\n\nYeah, that's great.\n\nBut I guess my fear is\n\nyou're doing great work in democratizing design,\n\nso you add AI to the mix,\n\nthere's people who are gonna\n\nlike raise the floor to do that, to make things look good.\n\nBut we've already seen what good enough does in ChatGPT\n\nand we're inundated with AI slop,\n\nand I guess it's sort of my nightmare\n\nthat this stuff looks better and draws us in even more.\n\nYeah, I think that it's interesting,\n\nwhen I look back at the history of Figma,\n\nthere was a moment where, I don't know, 2014, 2015,\n\nwhere I realized some of the negative effects\n\nof the power of design.\n\nI remember later in the night\n\nreading about the time ISIS was\n\na really important challenge\n\nthat we were facing globally.\n\nAnd there was a magazine they put out\n\nwhich was really horrific\n\nand it was incredibly well-designed.\n\nAnd designed as a power to lift\n\nbad actors as well as, that's extreme case obviously,\n\nas well as stuff that maybe just be like not as interesting.\n\nAnd I think that that is the reality\n\nof all tools is they have the power\n\nif they're made correctly to lift people up.\n\nAnd that's a debate that you can have\n\nI think about any tool.\n\nBut what I think is most important is\n\nthat we find ways to recognize that most\n\nof the AI tools right now are about lowering the floor.\n\nThey're about making it so that there's democratization.\n\nDemocratization is great in many ways\n\nand new use cases and markets aren't locked.\n\nYou talk to the people that do image generation\n\nwith diffusion models, not all of them are doing the things\n\nthat you expect.\n\nSome of them are doing like art therapy,\n\nwhich is never possible before.\n\nBut I also think it's so critical for us\n\nto really invest in, like I said,\n\nraising the ceiling and making these new possibilities\n\nfor designers.\n\nAnd that's where a lot of our thinking is right now.\n\nAnd that's where I hope we can drive towards.\n\nI'd love to go on, that's a great place to stop.\n\nThank you, Dylan. Thank you.\n\n[audience applauding]",

into work here,\n\nso it's a little bittersweet to be leaving,\n\nbut I feel really, really good about\n\neverything that we've been able to do.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of unfinished business,\n\nbut I think we have set a good path for the incoming team.\n\nI know my team is excited to continue\n\nto drive forward on the many priorities that we've set,\n\nbut all good things come to an end\n\nand looking forward to next adventures.\n\nAnd you've been here three and a half years, right?\n\nYeah, I came in, I was nominated in April,\n\nconfirmed in July, so over three and a half years.\n\nAnd then I was actually part of the transition team,\n\nI was the Cyber Policy Lead\n\nwhen I was still at Morgan Stanley.\n\nSo was working these issues early on\n\nand in fact, when I was the cyber policy lead,\n\nit was during the SolarWinds.\n\nSo that was a very interesting incident to observe,\n\nboth from being in the private sector,\n\nbut also being part of the transition team to see\n\nhow far we could come and frankly how far we have come\n\nwith respect to being able to secure the.gov,\n\nthe federal civilian executive branch.\n\nAnd so that was a useful sort of marker for me.\n\nThat must have been a really interesting vantage point\n\nand a good learning experience.\n\nI didn't realize that that was exactly the timing\n\nof when you came in because you know,\n\none thing we're gonna talk a lot about you and your tenure,\n\nbut one thing I wanted to bring up that I'm sure\n\nit's top of mind for everyone,\n\nand I'm sure it's something you've been engaged with,\n\nis revelations recently about Chinese espionage\n\nand hacking in US telecoms.\n\nSo I'm interested to know what you observed\n\nin that other situation,\n\nwhich was obviously Russian hackers, different situation,\n\nbut how were the lessons learned there then applicable\n\nwith the work you all are doing now in this response?\n\nWell, certainly what we saw in December of 2020\n\nwith the revelations about the intrusions\n\ninto federal government networks\n\nas well as businesses around the world,\n\nwas a pretty sophisticated supply chain espionage operation.\n\nAnd off the back of that, there were a lot of things\n\nthat were put in place in 2021\n\nto include through the executive order 14028,\n\nwhere a lot of the responsibilities came to CISA,\n\nthere was also some money that came to CISA\n\nthrough the American Rescue Plan Act,\n\nand I would say the bumper sticker\n\nwas to finally allow CISA\n\nin our role as America's Cyber Defense Agency\n\nand as the national coordinator\n\nfor critical infrastructure resilience and security\n\nto manage the .gov as an enterprise,\n\nnot as a disparate tribe\n\nof a hundred separate departments and agencies.\n\nSo what we've been able to put in place\n\nacross the so-called fseb, the.gov,\n\nover the past three and a half years,\n\nhas given us enormous visibility that we never had before\n\nand has allowed us to detect intrusions much more rapidly\n\nto be able to remediate them\n\nand to get ahead of future intrusions\n\nby understanding from an analytic perspective\n\nwhat exactly is happening on the .gov.\n\nAnd then frankly, using that information\n\nto be able to enrich our work with critical infrastructure\n\nbecause all of our networks are connected,\n\nthey're vulnerable in many ways.\n\nAnd so understanding and enriching what we know\n\nfrom what we see on the .gov\n\nto what we see in critical infrastructure has also been\n\na really important evolution.\n\nWith respect to China, as you know Lily,\n\nwe've been talking about this for years.\n\nThe big thing for me that changed\n\nbecause certainly I've been doing\n\ncyber for a very long time.\n\nWe were always very focused on the PRC\n\nwith respect to espionage campaigns and data theft\n\nand intellectual property theft.\n\nAnd we're certainly seeing that now\n\nwith this so-called salt typhoon campaign\n\nwith intrusions into our telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nBut the big thing for me was seeing\n\nintrusions into our critical infrastructure,\n\nnot for espionage,\n\nbut rather specifically for disruption and destruction.\n\nAnd we've talked a lot about that,\n\nI testified earlier this year,\n\nbut at the end of the day, this is really a world where\n\na major conflict in Asia,\n\nthe potential invasion or blockade of Taiwan by the PRC\n\ncould have very real consequences here in the US.\n\nYou could see pipelines being affected,\n\nwater being affected, telecommunications being severed,\n\nrail lines, power, exactly.\n\nAnd that is all part of a very deliberate effort\n\nby China to incite what they call societal panic\n\nand to deter our ability to marshal military might\n\nand citizen will.\n\nThis is all part of a very deliberate campaign\n\nand that's why we have been so laser focused,\n\nleveraging our technical talent at CISA\n\nto be able to work with the private sector to identify\n\nand eradicate these types of actors from their networks\n\nto provide mitigation and hunting,\n\nguidance, hardening guidance in\n\nwhat we just put out for telecommunications,\n\nguidance on how to communicate securely.\n\nYou saw that in some of our recent guidance\n\non end to end encryption,\n\nencrypted communications, which is really important.\n\nAnd then to work through mechanisms\n\nlike our joint cyber defense collaborative\n\nthat we stood up in August of 2021\n\nto work with a wide variety\n\nof those critical infrastructure sectors,\n\npower, telecommunications, aviation, transportation,\n\nto ensure that we have a common picture of the threat\n\nand that these entities know what they need to do\n\nto reduce risk.\n\nI think one of the most important things,\n\nand you and I have talked about this before,\n\nvis-a-vis Ukraine when we did a panel together\n\nwith Viktor Zhora of the Ukraine Cyber Defense Agency\n\nis really the importance of resilience.\n\nIt is gonna be extremely difficult\n\nto prevent disruption in a scalable way,\n\nand so we have to prepare for it.\n\nWe have to acknowledge that disruption may occur,\n\nbut the way that we train our people, how we exercise,\n\nhow we architect our systems needs to enable us to detect,\n\nrespond, and then recover\n\nso that we can mitigate the downtime\n\nfor critical infrastructure services\n\nthat are necessary for the American people.\n\nDo you think the espionage operations\n\nare getting too much focus and that actually,\n\nthere needs to be more focus\n\non this critical infrastructure infiltration?\n\nThat activity is tracked under this group volt typhoon.\n\nIs there maybe what folks are talking about\n\nin the public sphere is different than the focus\n\nat an agency like CISA or what's the balance there?\n\nYeah, I mean we are very focused overall\n\non PRC cyber actors,\n\nwhether they're the so-called salt typhoon\n\nfocused on espionage,\n\nwhether it's volt typhoon,\n\nfocused on disruption and destruction,\n\nwe are focused on working with our federal partners,\n\nwith our industry partners\n\nto be able to identify these actors and intrusions,\n\neradicate them and harden our networks.\n\nI think we should not get too down the rabbit hole.\n\nAnd is it salt, is it flax, is it volt?\n\nAt the end of the day, China, as we've seen in\n\nassessments from the intelligence community,\n\nis the most formidable, persistent cyber threat\n\nthat we are dealing with, that we will deal with.\n\nAnd it's why frankly very early on when I got here, Lily,\n\nI felt I needed to get what are the big ideas, right?\n\nYou're leading a federal agency,\n\na fairly new federal agency,\n\none that's been through a huge effort to organize it,\n\none that's just been after a pandemic,\n\na contentious election.\n\nSo what are the big ideas\n\nto build America's cyber defense agency?\n\nAnd that was all about how do we catalyze\n\nand mobilize collaboration,\n\ncollaboration with industry, with international partners,\n\nwith state and local partners.\n\nAnd to do it in a way that's not the old hack needs stale\n\npublic private partnerships where you go meet once a month\n\nand share secret level information,\n\nit's really ongoing, real time work together\n\nwith a recognition that if your critical infrastructure,\n\na threat to one is a threat to many,\n\ngiven the interdependence of networks.\n\nIt's also a recognition that the federal government\n\nhas to be responsive, has to be transparent,\n\nhas to add value.\n\nThat was very much informed by my time at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAnd that you really needed these scalable platforms.\n\nSo the collaboration piece,\n\nthe fact that big corporations\n\nneeded to recognize this threat\n\nas a existential business risk,\n\none that they needed to prepare for and really manage,\n\nnot as something that the IT folks deal with,\n\nbut manage as a matter of good governance.\n\nSo this idea of corporate cyber responsibility,\n\nbecause as you know,\n\nthe vast majority is owned by the private sector,\n\nthey are now on the front lines,\n\nthey are on the front lines of the cyber fight.\n\nSo they have to recognize\n\nthat they have a really important role\n\nin managing that cyber risk and working with the agencies\n\nto help us mitigate that risk.\n\nSo this whole idea of corporate cyber responsibility,\n\nthe other one was cyber civil defense.\n\nMy friend Craig Newmark talks about this,\n\nbut I love to think about this\n\nin our campaign for secure our world.\n\nThe whole idea is make cyber hygiene as common as\n\nphysical hygiene.\n\nWashing your face, brushing your teeth,\n\nit's the whole campaign inspired by schoolhouse rock\n\nthat we did a whole music video.\n\nThe idea is you want to make cyber sexy and cool,\n\nnot something that's scary\n\nbecause if people are scared by things,\n\nthen their brain shuts down.\n\nMake it cool, make it fun, make cyber sexy,\n\nthat's been one of the things I've been driving towards.\n\nAnd then the last thing is secure by design.\n\nAnd that's make cyber sexy, make technology safe.\n\nFor decades, we've accepted a world where\n\ntechnology has been delivered to us full of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so we've spent time glorifying the villains\n\nand blaming the victims.\n\nWe have to now hold vendors accountable\n\nfor designing and developing and testing and delivering\n\nsoftware and technology\n\nthat is specifically focused\n\non driving down the number of exploitable flaws.\n\nSo you think about those big ideas\n\nand that's what we've been driving towards.\n\nAgain, a lot of unfinished business.\n\nBut when you think about the continued ransomware attacks,\n\nwhen you think about the continued attacks from China,\n\nthat we can expect to continue,\n\nthese are not exotic attacks,\n\nthese are attacks that are using\n\nfor the most part, known vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so ensuring that the tech that we rely upon\n\nis as secure as possible is incredibly important as well.\n\nAnd I wanna ask you more about\n\nholding vendors accountable,\n\nby tying into the other thing you were saying about,\n\npublic private partnership and developing that rapport,\n\nhas been concerning to see how difficult it seems\n\nto have been for the telecoms\n\nto eradicate the Chinese hackers from their networks\n\nand to be certain or be very confident.\n\nHas there been progress\n\non some of those things that you're talking about\n\nin terms of being able to have that transparency\n\nand insight into what's actually going on?\n\nYeah, it's a really important question.\n\nSo after the revelations of these breaches,\n\nwe stood up what's called a Unified Coordination Group,\n\nwhich brings together the federal agencies, CISA, FBI,\n\nthe intelligence community.\n\nWe are focused on the response, so we are responding.\n\nFBI is going after, they're investigating,\n\ngoing after potential threat actors.\n\nThe IC folks like the National Security Agency are using\n\nwhat we see in the intelligence to understand\n\nthe extent of this intrusion by foreign actors.\n\nAnd we're coming together to work with\n\nthose known and suspected victims,\n\nand so we've been doing that for months now.\n\nI understand that some of the victims\n\nhave talked about being able to remediate these threats\n\nand I think that that's gonna be a long-term effort.\n\nI mean this has unfortunately been out in the press a lot\n\nand anything that gets-\n\nUnfortunately too!\n\nAnything that gets out there has the downside\n\nof having adversaries change their tactics.\n\nSo while I think the transparency to consumers is important,\n\nit also makes it more difficult\n\nto then find these actors within the networks.\n\nSo while they're using\n\nknown defects and technology to get in,\n\nonce they're in, they are hard to find.\n\nAnd in fact, CISA and this is one reason\n\nI'm so proud of the incredible technical talent of our team,\n\nit's one of the few agencies in the government\n\nthat have been able to find both volt typhoon\n\nwithin critical infrastructure as well as salt typhoon.\n\nAnd in fact, it was our work to find salt typhoon\n\nthat then led to law enforcement\n\nbeing able to identify virtual private servers\n\nthat were being leased by the adversaries.\n\nAnd then that unraveled the wider campaign.\n\nAnd that's just an example\n\nof some of the things that we're doing\n\nthat have helped improve our ability\n\nto manage the security of the .gov.\n\nBut this is a long-term effort, frankly,\n\nand I don't expect it to be remediated in the short term,\n\nthat's why at the end of the day,\n\nwe need to focus on resilience.\n\nOn the telecommunications infrastructure more broadly,\n\nwe have to understand that comms,\n\njust like my point on software and technology,\n\nthese systems were basically architected\n\nfor speed and efficiency,\n\nThey weren't built with security as top of mind,\n\nsecurity is in many ways in telecommunications\n\nand other aspects of critical infrastructure\n\nhas been bolted on because at the end of the day,\n\na lot of this technology was developed for speed,\n\nfor driving down cost, for cool features,\n\nsecurity was an afterthought and a bolt-on,\n\nand that's why we have a cybersecurity industry\n\nand jobs like mine.\n\nSo when I talk about the story of cybersecurity,\n\nI actually wanna work myself out of a job,\n\nI want to envision a future where ransomware\n\nis a shocking anomaly\n\nwhere damaging software vulnerabilities\n\nby nation state actors are as infrequent as plane crashes.\n\nA world where the technology\n\nthat we've come to rely on every hour of every day\n\nis first and foremost secure so that we can believe in\n\nwhat we are using\n\nand what is driving and powering our daily lives\n\nas something that is safe for ourselves, for our families,\n\nfor our small businesses.\n\nAnd that's the work that we've been catalyzing.\n\nThere's much more work to do,\n\nbut I think we have laid out a roadmap.\n\nAnd the most important thing\n\nabout getting those big ideas right,\n\nwas before we were able to put any of that into play,\n\nwas we had to have the right talent and the right culture.\n\nStarting from day one frankly, it was making sure\n\nthat we could retain the talent we have\n\nand then hire some of the incredible world class talent\n\nthat has been able to find these threat actors,\n\nhelp to eradicate and evict them,\n\nand then to ensure that we are working collaboratively\n\nwith our partners to help them drive down risk\n\nto the critical infrastructure Americans rely on.\n\nWhen you were talking before\n\nabout how in the wake of SolarWinds,\n\nthere were opportunities for CISA\n\nto expand its funding, its powers.\n\nDo you feel like the agency has the levers of control now\n\nthat it needs to do its work?\n\nWe are much bigger than when I started,\n\nin terms of number of people, we're about 3,400 people.\n\nWe've hired over 2,100 people since I came on board,\n\nwhich is pretty incredible when you think about\n\nthe talent that is very mission driven,\n\nbut they could go get paid a lot more money\n\nin the private sector,\n\nso really proud of that, our budget is nearly $3 billion.\n\nWe have much more authorities,\n\nto include some of the authorities we got\n\nout of the cyberspace solarium commission,\n\nlike the Joint Cyber Planning Office,\n\nwhich we made the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative,\n\nlike our ability to persistently hunt on federal networks.\n\nThat has allowed us to discover things like\n\nthe salt typhoon campaign that I mentioned.\n\nSo I think we are in great shape right now.\n\nWhat I would just tell my successor, first of all,\n\nyou're inheriting the best job in government.\n\nBut I would also say,\n\nlook, we are America's cyber defense agency.\n\nWhen you compare our size to the law enforcement agencies,\n\nthe investigative agencies or the intelligence agencies,\n\nwe are much smaller,\n\nbut I think we punch far above our weight.\n\nThe magic of CISA is the fact that\n\nwe are a partnership agency, a voluntary agency\n\nand everything we do is rooted\n\nin being able to catalyze trusted partnerships.\n\nAnd so it's not authorities\n\nto force compliance or enforcement.\n\nWe're not a regulator, we're not a military agency,\n\nwe don't collect intel, we don't do law enforcement.\n\nEverything we do is by, with and through partners,\n\nproviding no cost services and capabilities\n\nto enable critical infrastructure entities\n\nto manage and reduce risk.\n\nAnd I'm really proud of where we are,\n\nbut there's much, much more work to be done.\n\nAnd do you think the new administration\n\nwill be supportive of that?\n\nOn the one hand, in his first term,\n\npresident Trump was actually the one who elevated CISA\n\nto be an agency, full fledged agency.\n\nBut on the other hand, there have been some comments\n\nthat make it seem like perhaps his administration\n\nis no longer sort of putting a priority\n\non the mission of the agency.\n\nSo are you concerned about that?\n\nNo, I'm not concerned about it.\n\nI think anybody that takes a hard look at what CISA is,\n\nthe talent that we have,\n\nwhat we accomplished over the last several years\n\nwill appreciate the value that we bring\n\nto the American people.\n\nAnd CISA success is the success of the American people,\n\nit's national security.\n\nAnd while I know there's been a lot of\n\ndiscussion of politics and partisanship,\n\nat the end of the day,\n\ncybersecurity critical infrastructure security\n\nis not a political issue, it's not a partisan issue.\n\nAnd the American people understand that.\n\nAnd I grew up in a world\n\nwhere we didn't think at all about politics,\n\nI was a military officer,\n\nI worked for President George W. Bush, president Obama,\n\nnow President Biden, I am never driven by politics,\n\nI'm driven by mission.\n\nAnd I think that is very much the spirit and ethos\n\nof folks within CISA, we are very focused\n\non driving down risk to the American people.\n\nIf you just look at, for example, the elections,\n\nthe elections when election infrastructure\n\nwas designated as critical infrastructure in 2017,\n\nthat really was a no trust environment.\n\nThe states didn't want the federal government\n\nat all involved in elections,\n\nwhich are run by state and local officials.\n\nAnd it took a lot of work by my predecessor and that team\n\nand now my team to move from a no trust,\n\nlow trust environment to a pretty high trust environment.\n\nI mean, one of the things that I'm most proud about\n\nover the past several months\n\nwas our work with election officials across the country,\n\nto include some very conservative\n\nRepublican secretaries of State,\n\nspending time with Dave Scanlan up in New Hampshire\n\nwith Phil McGrane in Idaho.\n\nAnd then we spent time at the Midwest\n\nElection Security Summit with Bob Evnen of Nebraska,\n\nScott Schwab of Kansas,\n\nPaul Pate of Iowa, Jay Ashcroft of Missouri,\n\nMonae Johnson of South Dakota,\n\nand so this really shows people out in America\n\nwhere the work actually happens\n\nlook at us as an agency that is there to help.\n\nI think one of the things\n\nthat's been really important, Lily,\n\nis we have put an enormous amount of effort\n\ninto building our field force,\n\nas we've grown those 2,200 hirees,\n\nwe've built hundreds in our force of cybersecurity advisors,\n\nphysical security advisors who are out in every state\n\nto work with critical infrastructure owners and operators,\n\nbusinesses, large and small,\n\nto work with election officials,\n\nstate and local officials.\n\nAnd these are folks from those areas.\n\nSo while you may not, trust the federal government,\n\nif you're sitting in a state somewhere,\n\na very conservative state,\n\nyou trust your cybersecurity advisor\n\nwho you've known for years and years.\n\nAnd so that comes with sort of a built in ability\n\nto build those relationships.\n\nSo I'm very aware people don't trust institutions,\n\npeople trust people.\n\nAnd it's why everybody in CISA is very focused on\n\nnot only having the technical talent\n\nto enable us to understand and reduce risk,\n\nbut to build collaborative partnerships, right?\n\nIt's about developing those relationships\n\nto allow us to work together to reduce risk to the nation.\n\nAnd frankly, it's why I've been all over the world,\n\nall over the country to help us build that trust,\n\ncatalyze that trust, advance those partnerships\n\nin a way that we can work together\n\nfor the collective defense of the nation.\n\nLet's say this, defense is hard, right?\n\nWe know that.\n\nAnd when you were talking about holding vendors accountable,\n\nwanting to make these exploitable vulnerabilities,\n\na plane crash once in a blue moon rather than\n\nso common, are we getting there on that?\n\nIt feels like on endpoints on,\n\nin some ways there has been a lot of progress on,\n\nthat type of detection,\n\nbut then things move to the periphery,\n\nthey move to network devices, cloud,\n\nthe ongoing need for account hygiene and account security.\n\nSo are we winning, can you win at defense?\n\nDo you worry about that?\n\nYou're right, defense is hard.\n\nI say that as the America's cyber head goalie\n\nand that's why it has to be a team.\n\n'cause you need all those levers of power.\n\nAs much as we work to hunt for and eradicate Chinese actors\n\nand work with critical infrastructure to build resilience,\n\nour partners need to hold those actors accountable\n\nand to be able to hold our adversaries at risk.\n\nWhether that's through offensive cyber capabilities,\n\nwhether that's through indictments or sanctions,\n\nand so that's when we talk about cyber as a team sport.\n\nBut yes, we're on the defensive side and it's a challenge.\n\nI think we are making progress,\n\nwe have seen when we launched this\n\nsecure by design campaign, I like to call it the revolution,\n\nbut at the end of the day, this has been something that\n\nthere have been thought leaders talking about\n\nfor years and years and years.\n\nWe wanted to give it a platform\n\nthat was really highlighted\n\nby some of my fantastic technical experts.\n\nStarted working on this,\n\ntalked about it first in November of 2022,\n\nthen launched it at Carnegie Mellon\n\nin a big speech in early 2023,\n\nand then came together with our federal partners,\n\nwith international partners\n\nto start laying out the key principles for secure by design.\n\nLater that year,\n\nwe locked arms with our international partners,\n\nbut importantly, we worked very closely\n\nwith technology vendors.\n\nAnd you saw that in the pledge that we launched at RSA\n\nstarted out with 68 technology vendors, now we're over 260.\n\nAnd these are vendors who voluntarily committed\n\nto make significant and measurable progress on key areas,\n\nwhether that's enabling of multi-factor authentication,\n\nreducing default passwords, moving towards memory safety.\n\nAnd several of them have already started publishing\n\nprogress that they've made.\n\nAnd look, at the end of the day,\n\nthese technology vendors want to create safe products,\n\nit's just decades and decades\n\nwhere it hasn't been a priority,\n\nit's been driving down cost, it's been features,\n\nit's been speed to market for competition.\n\nAnd so I think we really have seen\n\nvendors grasping onto this.\n\nYou remember Ralph Nader wrote this bestselling book in 1965\n\nall about car crashes.\n\nCars were not focused on being safe,\n\nand I talk about secure by design\n\nas unsafe at any CPU speed.\n\nAnd you think about from 1965,\n\nI think it wasn't until 1983\n\nwhen the first state mandated use of seat belts.\n\nSo it took a long time.\n\nIt takes time, yeah.\n\nBut what I'm excited about Lily,\n\nis I think we can get there quicker.\n\nGPU speed.\n\nYes, maybe exactly, exactly.\n\nyou're going in my, you're speaking my language sister.\n\nSo it's AI,\n\nI think we can use the incredible power of AI\n\nand that's why we've been so excited about\n\nhow do we use generative artificial intelligence\n\nin large language models for cyber defense?\n\nSo when you think about, for example,\n\nnot to geek out on you too much,\n\nwhen you think about, when you think about\n\ntwo thirds of software vulnerabilities are memory safety\n\nvulnerabilities, right?\n\nSo buffer overflow or use after free vulnerabilities,\n\nand when you think about SQL injection,\n\nif you can drive down,\n\nif you can move from memory unsafe to memory safe.\n\nSo moving from C and C++ to things like Rust,\n\nrefactoring that code\n\ncan drive down the number of software vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so I'm excited about how fast this is moving.\n\nI wanna make sure that these capabilities\n\nare built to also be secure by design.\n\nAnd so we've been extending\n\nwhat we've been working on in software into AI\n\nand that's been a huge effort\n\nand a lot of fun, frankly,\n\nunder the leadership of our Chief AI officer.\n\nBut just think about using these capabilities.\n\nThis can accelerate our ability\n\nto get to a secure by design future.\n\nAnd what does that mean?\n\nIt doesn't mean perfect cybersecurity,\n\nwe're never gonna get to perfect cybersecurity,\n\nbut what we can get to is a technology ecosystem\n\nthat is much safer, much more secure,\n\nand frankly, defensible.\n\nSo driving down the number of exploitable defects,\n\nexploitable flaws that can really be accelerated\n\nby the use of generative AI,\n\nso I'm super pumped about that.\n\nSo I have to ask you, there's rumors,\n\nare you or are you not going on tour when you leave CISA?\n\nI certainly hope to be,\n\nyou and I actually met over a mutual friend Meryl Goldberg.\n\nYou wrote a fantastic article about\n\nher time in a Klezmer band\n\nand being in the Soviet Union and encoding music.\n\nAnd she and I ran into each other in the green room at RSA\n\nand I saw these instruments, the saxophone,\n\nand I was like, oh my gosh, what's happening?\n\nAnd that started this wonderful friendship.\n\nWe have bonded over music.\n\nI played piano and guitar when I was young,\n\nbut I really started with electric guitar\n\nwhen my son started taking it up during COVID.\n\nOh, there you go.\n\nAnd it's been the thing that has,\n\nbecause I love all kinds of music,\n\nthat's what's behind the joint Cyber Defense Collaborative.\n\nBut I started taking up electric guitar\n\nand that has been become my passion, my obsession.\n\nAnd as we were really focused on election security\n\nover the past couple months, I wasn't able to practice,\n\nbut now I'm getting back to it.\n\nSo I hope my big post-retirement plan several years from now\n\nis to start this bar, to have a band.\n\nWe're gonna do magic, we're gonna do improv,\n\nI'm gonna be the bartender, and so.\n\nIs there gonna be a cyber tie in or?\n\nWell, there'll always be some cyber tie in.\n\nMy team, I really wanted to start my own podcast in this job\n\ncalled, Bourbon and Bites,\n\n'cause I'm a big old fashioned fan,\n\nbut they didn't like the whole bourbon thing.\n\nSo there could be some podcasting from the bar.\n\nThere you go, okay.\n\nBut the cyber will always\n\nbe a part of my life no matter what I do.\n\nSomething I've done forever\n\nand I'm very passionate about the importance of\n\nensuring that we secure our world.\n\nFor everybody from K through Gray.\n\nAnd it's one of the things that's been motivating me\n\nto make cyber sexy and make tech safe.\n\nWill there be Rubik's cubes\n\nat every table in the bar?\n\nThere will, there will be Rubik's Cubes.\n\nI'm also sort of obsessed with the Rubik's Cube\n\nand I think we might have talked about this before,\n\nbut, so this is actually a CISA Cube\n\nand I like to think of it as a kind of a magic cube.\n\nBut let's see here, oh, there we go, all right, so.\n\nOh, there we go.\n\nThere we go, solve this CISA cube.\n\nBut I love this thing because when I was 11,\n\nthese things were introduced into the world\n\nand I was a huge puzzler and a video game person,\n\nand I became obsessed with it, learned how to solve it,\n\nand then I would go to toy stores,\n\nsay, I was this little kid with pigtails,\n\nif I can solve this in less than two minutes,\n\nwill you give me a free one?\n\nSo I was able to amass this whole.\n\nThe whole trove.\n\nAnd the reason I love it is because Erno Rubik,\n\nwho invented the thing, talked about, if you are curious,\n\nyou will find the puzzles around you.\n\nAnd if you are determined, you will solve them.\n\nAnd when I think about\n\nthe type of incredible technical talent\n\nthat we have here at CISA,\n\nyou think about the intellectual curiosity,\n\nit's the hacker mindset, it's the problem solver,\n\nbut it's the determination, the relentless drive\n\nto solve the most complicated problems out there.\n\nAnd that's, sort of symbolized in the CISA Cube.\n\nWell, it's really a pleasure to talk to you.\n\nYou as well.\n\nThanks so much for joining us.\n\nThank you as well, Lily.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nIt's hard to imagine life without Apple,\n\nbecause my life has been wrapped up in this company,\n\nas you've mentioned, since 1998.\n\nThis is a long time.\n\nIt's the overwhelming majority of my adult life,\n\nand so I love it.\n\nI'm Steven Levy.\n\nToday we sat down with Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nto discuss the company's past, present, and future.\n\nThis is The Big Interview.\n\nThank you for doing The Big Interview, Tim.\n\nThank you for being here, Steven.\n\nIt's always great to talk to you.\n\nYeah, well it's great to be at Apple Park.\n\nI'm looking this backdrop.\n\nI remember you gave me a tour of this place.\n\nYeah.\n\nBefore people moved in.\n\nAnd what about this place, working in here,\n\nand having your people in here\n\nis either unexpected or striking.\n\nIt's promoted collaboration even more than I thought.\n\nAnd that was a key component of the design, as you know.\n\nBut there's so many places in here\n\nthat you unexpectedly run into people.\n\nYou do it at the cafeteria, you do it at the coffee bar,\n\nyou do it outside when you're going across the pathway.\n\nAnd I think that promotes this unplanned collaboration.\n\nAnd I think it's fantastic.\n\nAlso, there's a connection here to Steve.\n\nYou know, of course we have the theater named after him,\n\nand think about him all the time.\n\nBut I can feel him in other spaces in here.\n\nHe had a perspective that the venue\n\nthat you worked in was so important to the work,\n\nand I think that he's been proven right.\n\nYou mentioned the theater.\n\nWill you do product launches now?\n\nYou do pre-tapes,\n\nor are you ever gonna see live launches\n\nin the Steve Jobs theater again like we used to?\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe thing that we learned during COVID was,\n\nyou know, the audience is primarily an online audience.\n\nVery few people can fit in the theater,\n\nand we wanted to have more people engaged\n\nin the announcements itself.\n\nAnd you can do\n\nthat a lot more productively on tape than you can in live,\n\nbecause of the transitions on the stage and so forth.\n\nBut you don't miss the vibe.\n\nI do miss it. I do miss it.\n\nI get it when the WWDC is here, and we announced the film\n\nand feel the love from the developers is fantastic.\n\nI heard something interesting recently that Stevie Wonder\n\nhad a demo of the Vision Pro and loved it.\n\nHow's that work?\n\nHe's a friend of Apple.\n\nIt's great to get feedback from Stevie,\n\nand of course his artistry is just unparalleled.\n\nHe's so fantastic.\n\nBut accessibility was always important\n\nfor us from designing all of our products,\n\nas you know, that's one of the common threads\n\nthrough Apple over time,\n\nis that we don't bolt on accessibility at the end\n\nof the design process, it's embedded in the design process.\n\nAnd so getting that feedback was key.\n\nSo I wanna look back a little bit\n\nthrough your time here.\n\nYou've been here a long time.\n\nYou got here in 1998.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThere had already been eras of Apple.\n\nThere had been the Apple II era.\n\nThe Mac, the diaspora era where Steve was gone.\n\nYou were a compact.\n\nDid you think that at any point watching\n\nwhat was going on that Apple was just not gonna make it?\n\nYou know, I probably thought that\n\nbefore talking to Steve.\n\nAt that time,\n\nif you remember Michael Dell had said if he was the CEO,\n\nhe would shut Apple down.\n\nAnd just return whatever assets were\n\nleft to the shareholders.\n\nAnd Michael just said what most everyone else thought.\n\nBut I have to say, when I came out to talk\n\nto Steve about working at Apple, it felt\n\nso alive and so different.\n\nHe was somebody\n\nthat was the most unusual CEO I'd ever met.\n\nHe was passionate about the product, passionate about Apple,\n\npassionate about its reason for being its purpose.\n\nAnd I thought, I've gotta do this.\n\nI want to do this.\n\nAnd from that point, I never thought\n\nthat Apple would be going out of business.\n\nAnd other people did,\n\nand other people advised me, why are you doing this?\n\nYou're leaving the world's largest personal computer company\n\nand going to one that may not survive.\n\nBut I didn't feel that way at that point\n\nafter talking to Steve.\n\nSo while you're here in your collaboration with Steve,\n\nyou know, Apple came out with, you know.\n\nThese great design products, the iMac,\n\nthen the iPod era, which was so exciting.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThere were so many different versions\n\nof iPods, then of course the iPhone.\n\nYes.\n\nLooking back, what did you do that was smart\n\nthat you really didn't think was going to be\n\nso impactful in making that product a success?\n\nWell, I think each product that you named sort\n\nof had its place in history.\n\nThe iMac revived Apple, it kind\n\nof proved Apple could survive.\n\nThe iPod giving people 1,000 songs in the pocket,\n\nsomething very unexpected,\n\nand solving a pain point that all of us had\n\nthat loved music.\n\nIt began to introduce people to more people,\n\nparticularly in the developed markets.\n\nAnd the decision to port to Windows proved\n\nthat Apple could come out with a product\n\nthat was larger than the Mac community.\n\nAnd then iPhone built on everything\n\nthat came before it.\n\nAnd with the great work\n\nfrom the technology team on multi-touch,\n\nit gave you a totally different way\n\nof interfacing with the product.\n\nAnd then what iPhone did looking back, was introduce people\n\nto Apple in the emerging markets.\n\nGoing out and forming all\n\nof these carry relationships was very important\n\nto introducing Apple more broadly\n\nand sort of turning the industry on its side\n\nand owning the design.\n\nBecause at that time, if you remember,\n\nthe carrier was owning the design of the phone,\n\nwas sort of directing it.\n\nAnd we said, no no, what we bring is the product skill.\n\nAnd what they brought was the networking skill.\n\nAnd we didn't have the networking skill\n\nand frankly they didn't have the product skill.\n\nAnd so this combination was very powerful.\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nWell, we're beginning maybe a new era of history now\n\nwith AI.\n\nApple Intelligence.\n\nI mean, do you think this is something\n\nthat is gonna wind up reinventing the company\n\nand reinventing the world?\n\nAre you on the cusp of that?\n\nI do. I think it's profound.\n\nI think just like multi-touch enabled iPhone\n\nand eventually iPad, and the modern smartphone,\n\nand the modern tablet, AI will reinvent\n\nand it provide a new era and a new chapter for iPhone\n\nand iPad, and the Mac, and all of our products over time.\n\nBecause I think it changes the way you interface\n\nwith the products.\n\nI get so much out of Apple Intelligence,\n\nand we're just at the beginning.\n\nSo Siri is one thing that's being revitalized here.\n\nI'm wondering, are we going\n\nto eventually have this relationship with Siri\n\nthat'll be our constant companion\n\nand we'll do, for instance,\n\neverything we might wanna do in search, instead of going\n\nto Google, we'll just ask Siri.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nBut I think, I use Siri a lot now.\n\nI'm a power user of Siri,\n\nand so I'm some of the billion five requests\n\nthat Siri gets every day.\n\nSo I already have a relationship with Siri,\n\nbut I think more people will,\n\nbecause Siri will become more personally relevant\n\nand be able to take task off your plate\n\nthat you don't have to do.\n\nAnd sort of a multi-step kind of approach\n\nthat you saw some of the demos do.\n\nSo I couldn't be more excited about the future of Siri.\n\nYou are the CEO.\n\nYou've been here for a while.\n\nHow long do you see yourself continuing this role?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nI get asked\n\nthat question now more than I used to.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nAs I age, as my hair turns gray,\n\nI love this place, Steven.\n\nI love it.\n\nAnd I love the people I work with.\n\nIt's a privilege of a lifetime to be here.\n\nAnd I'll do it\n\nuntil the voice in my head says it's time.\n\nAnd then I'll go and focus on\n\nwhat the next chapter looks like.\n\nMy life has been wrapped up in this company,\n\nas you mentioned, since 1998.\n\nThis is a long time.\n\nIt's the overwhelming majority of my adult life.\n\nAnd so it's tough to envision life without Apple.\n\nSo one more question.\n\nWhen we were all talking about the tour\n\nand things like that, I was also doing a story\n\nabout the Infinite Loop, One Infinite Loop.\n\nThat which used to be the Apple's headquarters.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd you told me\n\nthat you didn't move into Steve's office.\n\nI didn't.\n\nAfter he died, it was preserved.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that sometimes you would go in there.\n\n[Tim] Yes.\n\nAnd get inspired by being in the surroundings.\n\n[Tim] Yes.\n\nDo you still do that?\n\nIs that office still preserved?\n\nI still do that. The office is still preserved.\n\nNo one's ever moved in there.\n\nAnd that's been since 2011 as you know.\n\nMost of what we do is forward looking.\n\nBut I like my connection back to Steve,\n\nand I like the company's connection back to Steve,\n\nbecause from him emanates our values and our DNA.\n\nSo I think that connection's important.\n\nSo Tim, thank you so much for doing The Big Interview.\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nIt's so great to spend time with you.\n\nAs always.\n\nI'll bump into you in Palo Alto again.\n\nAlright. Yeah, in a few days.\n\nIn a few days.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAlright.\n\n[uplifting music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nI don't think our next guest needs much of an introduction,\n\nbut I've been given one, so I'm excited\n\nto welcome entrepreneur co-founder of Cost Plus Drugs,\n\nMark Cuban to the big interview stage\n\nfrom selling garbage bags door to door at age 12\n\nto founding a lot of groundbreaking tech companies,\n\nMark has always been ahead of the curve.\n\nIt's really no surprise that\n\nwith his latest venture Cost Plus Drugs,\n\nhe's also ahead of the curve.\n\nHe is working to demolish\n\nand rebuild the prescription drug industry.\n\nAnd that's what we're gonna talk about today.\n\nEveryone, please welcome Mark Cuban.\n\n[audience cheering]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMark, thank you so much for being here.\n\nI liked how you changed fuck up to demolish, you know?\n\nIt's a family friendly event.\n\nOh, then I should leave right now.\n\nThis is just like Shark Tank.\n\nSo I asked a friend here, actually, Sean, earlier today,\n\nI said, what should I, what should I kick off\n\nMark Cuban with?\n\nWhat should I say?\n\nAnd he said,\n\nwhy don't you give him a belated\n\ncongratulations for Klay Thompson.\n\nOh, there you go, Klay's killer.\n\nYeah, we thank everybody here for today.\n\nYeah, you're lucky that you're welcome in the Bay.\n\nI know.\n\nAfter that one actually.\n\nTrust me, I look over my shoulder.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nAll right, so let's talk about Cost Plus.\n\nWhen you actually,\n\nwhen our issue came out in which you're prominently\n\nfeatured, one thing I heard from people was,\n\nI didn't know Mark Cuban was in the pharmaceutical business.\n\nYou've been doing this for a while though.\n\nWhy did you get into pharma?\n\nDoes anybody here like their healthcare?\n\nDoes anybody here think the healthcare industry works well?\n\nThat's why, I mean,\n\nI literally got a cold email from a Dr. Alex Vishinsky\n\nwho wanted to start up a compounding pharmacy,\n\nwhich actually makes drugs that are on, in this case,\n\non short supply, that are on the shortage list.\n\nAnd I'm like, you're thinking too small.\n\nAnd that was right around the time Martin Shkreli\n\nwas going to jail.\n\nSo he was in the news\n\nand I was like, how can this one guy take control\n\nof this drug and jack up the price that dramatically?\n\nAnd so I'm like, let me just take a look.\n\nAnd when you look at the pharmaceutical industry, back then,\n\nit was very obvious that it was opaque.\n\nThere was no transparency at all.\n\nI mean, think about it.\n\nIf you get a prescription from your doctor,\n\nwhat's the first thing they ask you?\n\nNot can you afford it?\n\nIt's what pharmacy do you use?\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nAnd then you've gotta deal with the fear\n\nof can you afford it or what's the impact?\n\nWhat's the copay, what's the deductible?\n\nAll those things.\n\nSo we said, okay,\n\nlet's start a company called costplusdrugs.com\n\nand let's make it transparent.\n\nAnd it seems so simple, but the impact has been so dramatic.\n\nSo if you go to costplusdrugs.com\n\nand you put in the name of the medication\n\nand we've grown from a 111 to 2,500\n\nand we have more to go, you'll, if we carry it,\n\nthe medication pops up and you'll see our actual cost.\n\nSo we'll show you what we pay for it,\n\nwe mark it up 15%, if you want it delivered,\n\nand then there's a $5 pharmacist fee that's included\n\nbecause you have to have a pharmacist review it\n\nand then $5 to ship it to you.\n\nOr you can, now we have an affiliate network\n\nwhere you can pick it up at a local pharmacy just\n\nby showing our price, our cost, and only marking up 15%,\n\nwe were able to take down the price\n\nof drugs like Imatinib chemotherapy,\n\ndrug, MS drugs from like 2000 plus dollars a month\n\nto $21 a month, $35 a month.\n\nSo the impact has been insane.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nWhat are some of the common drugs people\n\nmight recognize that you're manufacturing and selling?\n\nI mean, you know, Imatinib is probably\n\nthe most dramatic example.\n\nI don't, I'm not the pharmacist,\n\nremember all the funky names.\n\nBut people with MS as an example, we are able to take,\n\nthere's a drug called Daroxadopa that\n\nI'll give you the, I'll give you a scenario.\n\nA friend of mine was in this horrific car accident\n\nand he needed to take this drug and lost his insurance.\n\nEmailed me and said, okay, they're telling me it's going\n\nto be $10,000 every three months.\n\nI'm like, okay, Landon, I'll check into it.\n\nTurns out we carried it\n\nand when we carried it back then it was $64 a month\n\nfrom 10,000 to 64 times three.\n\nAnd now it's in the $20.\n\nBecause as our volumes go up,\n\nbecause we do everything on a straight markup,\n\nour costs go down.\n\nAnd literally we have lowered the price\n\nof a medication every single weekday\n\nfor the past almost 18 months.\n\nAnd so if you think about it,\n\n[audience cheering]\n\nbut the most dramatic thing we did was unintentional.\n\nWe published our entire price list.\n\nAnd so there's places, if you really looked hard, you can go\n\nand find a price for a medication that you might need.\n\nBut there's no place where the\n\ncompany published their entire price list.\n\nAnd we did that for all 2,500 drugs.\n\nAnd what's happened now is that researchers are able to use\n\nthat price list to compare to what the government is paying\n\nfor things to compare to what states are paying.\n\nAnd if you have a company that self insures\n\nto start the process of allowing you to compare\n\nwhat the company pays for the medications\n\nthat their employees and the you know, the people\n\nthat they cover, the population, they cover what they pay.\n\nAnd that has just been a game changer.\n\nI mean, we've had researchers from Vanderbilt, Harvard,\n\nall these different places say, you know, if,\n\nyou know Medicare bought these nine drugs\n\nfrom Cost Plus Drugs, just nine drugs\n\nwould save $3.6 billion a year if they\n\nbought these 11 drugs that, you know, they might,\n\nit's $6.3 billion a year.\n\nI mean, it's insane.\n\nAnd literally, you know, for so many folks out here\n\nin the Valley,\n\nprobably the easiest way to raise money\n\nand put cash in your own pocket is\n\nto change your healthcare plan.\n\nAnd in particular, your pharmacy benefit manager.\n\nBecause the crux of this problem\n\nand the opacity of the industry,\n\nthere are three pharmacy benefit managers that control, give\n\nor take 80% of the market.\n\nSo these are basically, these are the middlemen?\n\nThe middlemen, yeah.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd literally, they don't want you to know what you pay.\n\nIf you work with a self-insured company\n\nand they're working with one of the big three one,\n\nlet's just say the biggest PBMs,\n\nyou're getting ripped off, guaranteed.\n\nThe quickest way is to raise money if you have over\n\n100 employees and self-insure is\n\nto change your healthcare program.\n\nAnd in particular, pharmacy benefit manager,\n\nthat's immediate cash in the bank.\n\nAnd you know, companies don't really realize that.\n\nAnd that's why it's been so successful.\n\nBecause the next question always is how did this happen?\n\nAnd the reality is there's 155 million people covered\n\nby self-insured employers.\n\nAnd it's not the core competency of a CEO\n\nto understand all their healthcare benefits.\n\nYou just don't, I mean, like.\n\nYou could ask a couple of them here\n\non stage today if you want.\n\nHappy to.\n\nYeah, you should.\n\nBrian Chesky, let's talk to him about health.\n\nYou know, and you say.\n\nYeah, Jensen Wong,\n\nI'm sure he wants to talk about health plans.\n\nYeah, Jensen, you know, just say, would you?\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nAsk them, why are you dealing with one\n\nof the big pharmacy benefit managers and ask them, is that,\n\nbecause here's what's happening that's crazy\n\nthat they're gonna be, here's why,\n\nthey're starting to understand there's a law called\n\nERISA that requires the employer now\n\nto take on their fiduciary responsibility for the cost\n\nand care of all the lives they cover for as employers.\n\nAnd J and J and Wells Fargo just got sued\n\nand they're gonna lose.\n\nWhich effectively means\n\nthat every single major self-insured employer is going\n\nto get sued in a class action suit.\n\nAnd so if any of you fall into that trap, get ready,\n\nthey're coming.\n\nBut the bigger point again, is\n\nnow there's transparency for medications.\n\nAnd you can cut the cost,\n\nwhether you're a little company or a big company.\n\nAnd if you have a high deductible or you\n\nor you're uninsured, always check the pricing,\n\n'cause otherwise you're gonna get ripped off.\n\nSo you've made it pretty clear you're not doing this\n\nfor altruistic reasons.\n\nYou're running a business.\n\nYou want this to be a profitable business.\n\nI think people hear about what you're doing\n\nand they think, oh, it's altruistic.\n\nLike it's because you're doing something good.\n\nWell, I could make more money.\n\nRight?\n\nBut, what you said in.\n\nSeriously, but we're a public benefit corporation,\n\nbut how much fucking money do I need?\n\nYou know, I'm not trying to land on Mars.\n\nYou know, it's just,\n\n[group laughing]\n\n[audience cheering]\n\nand not to take anything away from him\n\nfor trying, more power to him.\n\nBut the reality is, I mean, at this point in my life,\n\nit's just like, more money, fuck up the healthcare industry?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nThat was, that was the word I left out of the intro.\n\nYou guys.\n\nF-U-C-K the healthcare industry.\n\nBut how did you, but I guess\n\nwhat I'm getting at is like, how did you decide on\n\nthat being the industry you wanted to go after?\n\nBecause it was so obvious that it would be easy to change\n\nthat it was insane.\n\nWhat had happened in the past is I dug in more,\n\nand we've been in business now, we started shipping,\n\nyou know, two and a half years ago.\n\nAnd you know, now we have millions of people\n\nwhose lives we've changed.\n\nBut you start to realize that\n\nwhat the incumbents would do is they'd go in\n\nand just buy companies.\n\nSo anybody that was a threat, they'd just buy 'em.\n\nAnd one after another, we'd go into situations\n\nwhere we're talking to employers or whatever,\n\nand they're saying, yeah, we were gonna do\n\nbusiness with this company.\n\nAnd they were trying to cut the cost,\n\nbut then so and so bought 'em.\n\nAnd like I said that's just not in the cards for us.\n\nLet's talk about tariffs.\n\n[Mark] Tariffs.\n\nTariffs.\n\n[Mark] Okay.\n\nSo President-elect Donald Trump is.\n\nI know who he is, yeah.\n\nYou heard of him?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nOkay, so he said that he's planning\n\nto impose tariffs Canada, Mexico, China day one.\n\nWe don't know exactly how that's gonna shake out yet,\n\nbut we do know that this could affect the drug industry.\n\nI mean, he's referring often to the illegal drug industry.\n\nBut also this could affect\n\nthe pharmaceutical business.\n\nHow is this potentially going to affect Cost Plus Drugs?\n\nI mean, if it's just China, it won't impact us at all.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nI mean, because we had,\n\n'cause I checked, we had 16 drugs that we bought\n\nthat were shipped from China\n\nand we're changing that to a different manufacturer.\n\nSo the Chinese tariffs won't impact us at all.\n\nAnd now we do get drugs from India.\n\nSo we'll see what happens there.\n\nBut if there are tariffs, our, we only have 15%.\n\nAnd so, you know, we'd have to pass them through.\n\nPass them through meaning the cost goes to the consumer?\n\nRight, the cost would go up 'cause our cost would go up.\n\nOkay.\n\nHave you talked to Donald Trump about this?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nSure, I was like, yo, what's up bro?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nNo, I have not.\n\nYou have not?\n\nIf the conversation were to occur,\n\nif you were invited to have,\n\nwhat's your priority?\n\nWhat's the first thing you would say?\n\nI would say don't fuck it up.\n\nIt's working.\n\nYou know, I mean, I don't look, there's no point in trying\n\nto guess what he's going to do and speculate,\n\n'cause we don't know, I don't think he knows yet.\n\nI think he's trying to, you know, he plays it by feel\n\nand it'll go where he goes and we will react accordingly.\n\nBut I think, you know, he's obviously very cognizant of PR\n\nand the idea that medications from the cheapest provider are\n\ngoing up and it means more\n\npeople aren't able to afford it.\n\nI really don't think he's going in that direction, you know,\n\nI really think he'd make an exception.\n\nYou were clearly a vocal supporter\n\nof Kamala Harris for president.\n\nWhen you look back at?\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nYou see how good a job I did?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nWhen you look at, when you look back at this election\n\nseason, is there anything\n\nthat you think you would've done differently\n\nor taken a different approach in terms of\n\nhow you were communicating?\n\nNot really, I mean, I'm not the candidate.\n\nI did the best I could to try to convey, you know,\n\nwhat she was doing for business people,\n\nsmall business, you know.\n\nAnd I think, you know, the message was good,\n\nbut, you know, they weren't voting or not voting for me.\n\nYeah.\n\nOne of the things\n\nthat we talked about when we did the big interview in the\n\nmagazine was crypto.\n\nAnd, you know, you feel pretty strongly\n\nand you're in favor of crypto\n\nand you were in favor of it not being villainized.\n\nAnd you felt as though that's\n\nwhat Gary Gensler and the SEC had been doing.\n\nAnd I think it really hurt her.\n\nSo you do?\n\nYeah, I really do.\n\nSo what's interesting is, because my response to you was,\n\nisn't that sort of a fringe issue?\n\nAnd you said no, but in a?\n\nHow many people here own crypto?\n\nAnd so when the price go, when crypto go up,\n\neverybody smile, you know?\n\nAnd if, when, you know, if you're,\n\nparticularly if you're a young male\n\nand you're not part of the traditional banking system,\n\nyou know, when I was a kid, open up a bank account,\n\nopen up a savings account, now download an app, right?\n\nRobinhood or Coinbase buy crypto\n\nbecause your friends are buying crypto,\n\nyou understand it more.\n\nMaybe you buy stocks,\n\nbut more kids were getting into crypto\n\nand that was their net worth.\n\nAnd when 40%, according to Pew research\n\nof young men own crypto or have owned crypto,\n\nand the guy you're connected to,\n\nGary Gensler is basically telling you to roll over\n\nand let me stick a bike handle in your ass that just like.\n\nA what?\n\nYeah, I was gonna say worse,\n\nbut I was just going, yeah, that was stupid.\n\nSorry, but basically you say.\n\n[Host] Did you say a bike handle?\n\nYeah, forget it.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nI'm sure that's something Elon will tweet about at me.\n\nBut in any event,\n\nbut Gary Gensler did not make it good\n\nfor people who own crypto.\n\nAnd I think that truly hurt Kamala\n\nand I even said it, I said it to her, I said it to her team,\n\nI said it publicly that Gary Gensler could lose the election\n\nfor her, and you know, when there's what,\n\n240,000 votes across seven swing states,\n\nand the number of men, young men\n\nwho voted against her was much higher than expected.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch to connect the two.\n\nWhat happens to crypto now?\n\nI think, you know, it's, you know, the laissez-faire,\n\nit's whatever comes, comes, you know.\n\nBut it was interesting when he talked about putting, if any\n\nof the BRICS countries stopped using the dollar\n\nas the de facto reserve currency,\n\nthat he was gonna put tariffs on then,\n\nwhich is the antithesis of what people who gave him a lot\n\nof money and support Bitcoin think they, you know,\n\nthey think a big part of the value\n\nof Bitcoin is the fact that fiat currency is weak\n\nand the Federal Reserve weakens it\n\nand it doesn't have a great future.\n\nSo here's Bitcoin to save the day.\n\nSo it'll be interesting to see if he follows through on that\n\nand what the Bitcoin Maxis think about it.\n\nDoes, I mean, is this a moment where Bitcoin\n\nand other crypto currencies actually become more legitimate\n\nor less under?\n\nIt's not about legitimate, it's like gold, right?\n\nI mean god, it's not based off the supply\n\nand demand on jewelry, right?\n\nPeople see it as an option in the event of, you know,\n\nthe economy going down or something bad happening.\n\nBut people aren't gonna walk around with gold bars.\n\nOh look, he owns gold.\n\nBam, now I own gold.\n\nBam, right?\n\nWhat are you gonna do it?\n\nLet me slice you\n\noff a little piece of gold.\n\nYou know?\n\nAnd no people look at it, you know,\n\nFort Knox has got a ton of gold that the United States owns,\n\nyou know, and it's supposed to be an underlying asset\n\nor commodity for the dollar in some respects, right?\n\nTo buy and sell and people look at Bitcoin\n\nas a better version of gold.\n\nAnd I agree with that, I think it's a great store of value.\n\nIt's easier to buy and sell.\n\nYou can fractionalize it, you can buy things,\n\nyou can transfer it internationally.\n\nAnd so I think it has more value than gold.\n\nSo I don't think you have to legitimize it,\n\nbut in terms of the price, you know, I own enough\n\nthat I really want it to go up.\n\nBut it's just supply and demand.\n\nHow much do you own?\n\nA lot.\n\nGlad we got that out of the way.\n\nWe have 10 minutes left\n\nand there's so much I want to ask you about.\n\nI feel like we could talk about crypto the whole time.\n\nI also wanted to ask you about AI,\n\nbut I think we're, one thing I'll say about AI,\n\nand then we should move on from it into the platforms,\n\nis that when, when we spoke for the big interview,\n\nyou asked me,\n\nwhat would you trust more in an environment if you like,\n\nyou weren't able to see, you said a, what is it\n\na self-driving car or a seeing eye dog?\n\n[Mark] Right, right, right.\n\nAnd I said a Waymo and you said, I trust the dog.\n\nAnd I just wanna say,\n\nwhile you're here in San Francisco, you should take a Waymo.\n\nNo, I want to actually.\n\nYeah, so if someone here, if anyone would like\n\nto pull up their app and get a Waymo ride\n\nfor Mark Cuban on this.\n\nI can do that, I know how to download the app.\n\nHe'll pay for it.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nBut the difference is a dog will recognize adversarial\n\nsituations better than AI can.\n\nRight, when you were talking about\n\ntraining the video and all that.\n\nBut I, let's talk about the platforms\n\nbecause you are a very active twitterer.\n\nYou're not using it quite as much anymore.\n\nNearly at all.\n\nYou've gone to Blue Sky.\n\nHow would you describe this moment\n\nfor, I'm just gonna call it Twitter.\n\nHow would you describe this moment for Twitter?\n\nI think it's an existential moment for Twitter.\n\nI really do.\n\nI go over to Blue Sky\n\nand I can engage like it's, you know, 2015\n\nor 2016 like we did on Twitter.\n\nAnd literally, I can talk about the Mavs\n\nand people aren't going to come in\n\nand say fuck, the Mavs, you're an asshole.\n\nYou know, you look like.\n\n[Host] You took Klay Thompson.\n\nYeah, you took Klay Thompson.\n\nOh, I get some of those but that's okay.\n\nOr you look like Rachel Maddow when you wear glasses,\n\nyou know.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nYou know just dumb shit.\n\nThat's the tame stuff.\n\nYou know whats crazy.\n\nNo, it's crazy.\n\nI counted, so whenever Elon would talk shit to me,\n\nI would just bookmark it on Twitter\n\nand somebody said that he said something\n\nand I would just check and he had it.\n\nBut I just decided to count\n\nhow many times he has posted about me\n\nor replied about me in the last 12 months.\n\nMore than 40 times, I stopped at 40.\n\nAnd it's just like, what the fuck?\n\nYou know, I mean, I don't mind going back and forth at him,\n\nbut who, like we talked\n\nbefore, whoever controls the algorithm,\n\ncontrols the platform.\n\nAnd when you have an algorithm that defines\n\nwhat happens on the platform\n\nand what you see, you get one type of engagement,\n\nwhen you go to Blue Sky where you completely control\n\nthe experience,\n\nyou get a completely different type of engagement.\n\nAnd so I can talk about Cost Plus Drugs and really engage.\n\nI can talk about, you know, I can see other discussions\n\nand jump in and ask questions.\n\nAnd it was, it's been great.\n\nI mean, literally,\n\nand when some idiot comes along, like somebody\n\nwho comes over from Twitter who likes\n\nto give me there comes on, not only can you block 'em\n\nand it's a real block,\n\nbut you can do this thing if you started the thread\n\nwhere you can say hide reply for everyone,\n\nthat's like the best thing in the world ever.\n\nBecause, you know, I want to talk about the Mavs\n\nor Cost Plus or whatever, and troll comes in, troll gone.\n\nAnd the one thing about a troll is a troll wants\n\nto be seen, right?\n\nIf you know, within 15 minutes you're gone\n\nand nobody's gonna see what you posted,\n\nthere's no point in continuing to fight it,\n\nparticularly since you truly can't see my post.\n\nAnd even if they, you know, create burner accounts\n\nor whatever to try to get in,\n\nit just takes two seconds to do it.\n\nAnd so as a result, you know,\n\nI forget the topic I was talking about,\n\nbut I counted, I literally counted that there was over five.\n\nAnd if you go to Blue Sky, I'm MCuban,\n\nand you'll see my reference to this,\n\nthat there were 526 responses to something\n\nand only five trolls posted.\n\nAnd that took me just a minute to clean 'em out.\n\nAnd it was a great conversation.\n\nI mean, just.\n\nDo you feel like there, that the Blue Sky\n\nis in any way just becoming an echo chamber\n\nof the people who decided that Twitter was too toxic\n\nor too right wing for them.\n\nTo a certain extent yes.\n\nAnd now they've just moved over to Blue Sky?\n\nTo a certain extent yes.\n\nSo how in a sense, how does that fix anything?\n\nIt doesn't matter, right?\n\nBecause, you know, if I want to talk like the Mavs, right?\n\nSo I went to a bunch of sports writers\n\nand there's these things called Sport Starter Packs\n\non Blue Sky.\n\nAnd they were all in there, and I said.\n\nWe have a Wired one, follow it.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe Wire starter pack.\n\nAnd you see what happens.\n\nI can engage with them and talk Mavs and see where it goes.\n\nAnd you know, like Ben Shapiro, he has an account there\n\nand I can engage with him.\n\nI may agree or disagree,\n\nbut if I start the thread, I have control of it.\n\nAnd if it turns out to be a legitimate argument\n\nor discussion, that's great.\n\nAnd you know the point being\n\nthat whoever controls the Thread controls the conversation\n\nand it can open it up to anybody they want.\n\nAnd there's no for you page, you know,\n\nso it's not like it's dominated by everything\n\nthat Elon says.\n\nIt's dominated, you know, it's dominated\n\nby the people you follow or the list that you create\n\nor the feeds that you follow.\n\nAnd so you get to really engage and that's, it's cool.\n\nI mean, it's just like all that intellectual engagement\n\nthat we kind of miss from Twitter where it was like, oh,\n\nthis is a great topic, I want to learn more.\n\nOr I'm just, you know,\n\nwatching these people have this conversation, it's amazing.\n\nAnd there's, you know, yeah, there's one\n\nor two idiots in there, you know, not,\n\nI'm not even talking about people I disagree with,\n\nbut people who just say stupid stuff, right?\n\nHateful stuff.\n\nIt's so de minimus\n\nthat the engagement is amazing.\n\nAnd I think that's why it's growing.\n\nAnd you even saw the New York Times come on there\n\nand someone told me they referenced one\n\nof their posts on Blue Sky as,\n\nand where in the past they would do that on Twitter,\n\nyou know, and to see them move over\n\nto escape what's going on over there is great.\n\nAnd here they are, I don't know their latest numbers,\n\nbut they have more than 22 million users.\n\nAnd I can tell.\n\nI think we're gonna get update on those\n\nnumbers shortly actually.\n\nJay coming on stage.\n\nJay comes on.\n\nBut you gotta try it.\n\nAnd like I said, I'm MCuban, try it.\n\nI mean, bring your friends on there.\n\nIt is truly a social network.\n\nHey, was that the Mavs game?\n\nDa da da, I was there to, I mean, that's insane, to be able\n\nto have that conversation on a social network.\n\nI think that there was, there's been this idea\n\nfor a long time, and certainly I think probably when you\n\nwere starting out as an in internet entrepreneur, that\n\nthe internet was a little bit downstream from culture.\n\nAnd now we've come around to this idea\n\nthat the internet is culture.\n\nAnd we certainly saw that play out a lot\n\nin this election too.\n\nAnd there were some reactions, responses\n\nto the outcome of this election is saying that, well,\n\nthe on the left people don't have the same kind of audience\n\nthat people are gaining on the right, right?\n\nLike, there's no podcast for the left.\n\nThat was something that.\n\nYeah, I don't agree with that at all.\n\nSo yeah, so talk about this like,\n\nbecause if everyone who just doesn't like Twitter anymore,\n\nmoves to Blue Sky\n\nor moves to Threads or moves to something like it,\n\nbut Twitter remains while small, relatively in numbers\n\nto some social networks, but sort of outsize influence\n\notherwise.\n\nI don't think Twitter.\n\nI mean, if you want to know what Elon thinks,\n\nTwitter's amazing and that's great, right?\n\nThat's his platform.\n\nSo how do we distinguish reality?\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nHow do we distinguish reality then on social media?\n\nI mean, what's really happening?\n\nI've been on Theo Von, I've been on The Nelk Boys,\n\nI've been on all those podcasts and everything,\n\nbut Joe Rogan, he won't have me on for whatever reason.\n\nAnd so when you go on there,\n\nthey just want to have a conversation.\n\nAnd from that conversation, there's a ton of clips.\n\nLike Andrew Schultz, I had a great conversation with him.\n\nThey're still posting clips, right?\n\nAnd so when you go on those, it's not that they're right\n\nor left, it's that they create clips\n\nthat feed the algorithm on Twitter.\n\nAnd so if you happen to, you know, be a fan of theirs\n\nand comparable things, the algorithm's gonna find you,\n\nyou know, the algorithm always finds you with things\n\nthat you've shown interest in.\n\nAnd so that's great.\n\nBut the way to deal with that isn't in trying\n\nto get more Andrew Schultz's, you know, to conjure that,\n\nthe way to deal with that is to flood the zone.\n\nYou know?\n\n[Host] What does that mean?\n\nWhat does that look like?\n\nWhat that means is either going\n\nand going, making the rounds\n\nand, you know, creating things that are,\n\nthat are worth talking about or worth showing,\n\nor just create memes left\n\nand right so that it just dominates the algorithms.\n\nSo like I told the Harris campaign\n\nand you know, they really didn't pursue it.\n\nYou have to, I had a conversation with Mr. Beast\n\nthat was illuminating to no end.\n\nAnd he basically said, he said, spends millions\n\nof dollars reverse engineering the algorithms\n\non each platform.\n\nAnd that's where he comes up with the ideas on\n\nwhat to do next.\n\nAnd that's exactly\n\nwhat the next political campaign has got to do.\n\nYou've got to figure out what you know, for each type\n\nof individual that you want to get to vote for you\n\nthat you want to engage.\n\nYou have to figure out their algorithm,\n\n'cause each one of us in this room has our own algorithm on\n\nTwitter that, you know, it's effectively customized\n\nfor us on Twitter, Instagram, et cetera.\n\nAnd so you have to flood the zone with\n\nas many different memes, clips, everything that you can do.\n\nSo there's something for everybody.\n\nAnd you had, there's so much volume you can't miss it.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with the right or left.\n\nI mean, like I told 'em, it could be,\n\nit's not like it was facts\n\nthat made the difference in this election, right?\n\nYou know, they're eating cats\n\nand dogs, you know, he's fucking a couch.\n\nYou know, that's what they needed more of,\n\nmore couch fucking stuff for real right?\n\nBecause if there would've been\n\n600 million couch fucking extensions,\n\neverybody would've seen it continuously\n\nbecause the memes don't filter out, right?\n\nThe algorithms don't filter out, right?\n\nThey filter forward.\n\nAnd that's politics going forward.\n\nAnd you really do think\n\nthat would've altered the outcome of the election?\n\nI think if you would, it would've made\n\nall the difference in the world.\n\nBut because when there's,\n\nbecause when Donald Trump would talk about their\n\neating cats and dogs, everybody had to cover it.\n\nAnd it turned into a meme, even though it started\n\nas one person posting one thing on Facebook when they\n\nstarted talking about weird at the beginning,\n\nwhen they talk about Brat, when they talk about\n\nfucking the couch, it was everywhere.\n\nAnd everybody had to respond to it.\n\nYou have to flood the zone.\n\nThey started Kamala's campaign,\n\nstarted off flooding the zone with stuff,\n\nand then dropped it\n\nand tried to be, you know, tried to use accuracy\n\nas a differentiator.\n\nWhereas, you know, Donald Trump's,\n\nhe floods the zone continuously.\n\nThat's what he does.\n\nThat's who he is as a campaigner.\n\nHe's a great salesperson.\n\nHe's willing to put himself in just all kinds\n\nof crazy situations and flood the zone with information.\n\nAnd it got to the point in my mind, at the end of the day,\n\nit was, who do you trust more?\n\nFor the things that they scared\n\nthat you were scared most about?\n\nWere you scared most about tariffs?\n\nWere you scared most about people eating cats and dogs?\n\nYou know, were you scared most about taxes?\n\nWere you scared most about immigration and the border?\n\nAnd they scared you and then they flooded\n\nthe zone with memes.\n\nAnd that's, to me what that and partially crypto.\n\nWe're out of time.\n\nBut I do have to ask you one more question.\n\nI want to leave the audience with a note of hope, optimism\n\nin somewhat politically volatile, unstable times.\n\nI hate saying that in these times, in this moment.\n\nHow, what would you say to people?\n\nWhat's a piece of advice you have to give to people\n\nfor navigating that, for living their lives?\n\nLook, you guys are here for a reason.\n\nYou're here because you believe in something better.\n\nYou believe in something bigger, in this country\n\nthat we are the one country in the world\n\nwhere when you have an idea\n\nand you get that feeling in your stomach,\n\nyou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\nAnd then you say to a friend, oh, I got this idea.\n\nWhat do you think Lauren?\n\nAnd Lauren goes, oh, that's really cool.\n\nAnd then you go and Google it.\n\nOr now you put it into ChatGPT, or Gemini or whatever,\n\nand it gives you a business plan\n\nand go, oh my God, I can do this.\n\nWhat makes us different is we go out there and do it.\n\nThat's who we are as a country.\n\nWe may be in weird times right now politically,\n\nbut that doesn't change who we are as Americans,\n\nthe President, you know, we can be afraid\n\nand we can be aware and we can be concerned.\n\nBut what you do\n\nand who you are, that's what makes us different.\n\nAnd so I am bullish on the United States of America,\n\nno doubt about it because that's why people are here.\n\nIt's not like people aren't showing up.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nYou know, it's not like people aren't coming\n\nto this Wired conference.\n\nIt's not like, you know,\n\nthere aren't great interviews up here.\n\nIt's not like people are saying, oh we're\n\nfucked let's just go sleep, right?\n\nNo, people are doing what we do\n\nand that's what makes us unique.\n\nIf you look at every single new technology over the last,\n\nwe talked about this, so over the last 30 years, 95%\n\nof them have come here.\n\nMaybe they were born somewhere else, but they're here.\n\nAnd the companies were born here or grown here\n\nbecause that's what we do.\n\nWho the fuck else does that?\n\nWe do as Americans.\n\nAnd that's not going to change\n\nno matter who the president is.\n\nSounds like a stump speech.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nMark, unfortunately, that's all the time we have.\n\nI'd love to keep talking.\n\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nThanks for having me, Laura.\n\nIt's really great.\n\nIt's really great hearing from you.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nAll right.",

future.\n\nWe're talking about somebody, once again, Phil Wizard,\n\nwho saw some breakers in 2009\n\nwhen he was in middle school.\n\nWent home, he thought it looked really cool.\n\nWent home and got on YouTube,\n\nlooked it up, and 15 years later\n\nhe won an Olympic gold medal.\n\n[crowd cheers]\n\nSo I would humbly posit to you\n\nthat the stuff that we are about to speak about\n\nand the stuff that you will see,\n\nthat you just saw, rather,\n\nthat is what a lot of this stuff is about.\n\nThat is what the technology is moving.\n\nThis is the stuff that goes into the phones,\n\ngoes into the computers.\n\nThis is the stuff that we're doing.\n\nSo I would love to bring out, once again,\n\ntop rank B-boy before the Olympics even happened,\n\nand now the first ever gold medalist B-boy,\n\nPhil Kim, AKA, Phil Wizard.\n\n[audience cheers] [upbeat music begins]\n\nMy man.\n\n[audience applauds] [upbeat music continues]\n\nGood to talk again.\n\nGood to talk to you again.\n\nYeah, man.\n\nSo I just, first off, I want to thank you\n\nfor just silencing the haters.\n\nFirst off, man,\n\nif you have not seen this person's Instagram, look at it.\n\nIt is incredible.\n\nI mean, cookies, cakes, like biscuits, baguettes.\n\nThis dude eat like,\n\nand you will see him like posting himself\n\neating like all of this, I'm not gonna say junk food,\n\nbut very, very tasty looking treats.\n\n[Phil] Soul food.\n\nSoul food.\n\n[Dexter laughs]\n\nVery tasty looking treats.\n\nAnd you got people in the comments saying, Bro, stop.\n\nWe need you good for the Olympics.\n\nYeah, I literally had people,\n\n'cause you could bet at the Olympics on who's gonna win.\n\nAnd I had people in my DMs being like,\n\nYo, I put money on you.\n\nCan you fix your diet?\n\nLike you need to eat healthy.\n\nAnd then one of my other friends messaged me\n\nbecause his friend had messaged him\n\nbeing like, Is this how he really eats?\n\nAnd one of my best friends know, he's like,\n\nYo, when he eats like this you know he's on.\n\nLike, he's ready.\n\nI think the day before you posted yourself eating\n\nlike cookies or something like that.\n\nYeah, I mean I just like to enjoy life.\n\nLike those things, obviously,\n\nlike health and nutrition is extremely important\n\nin anything physical.\n\nBut I think people don't understand,\n\nlike those aren't, it's not all I eat.\n\nMy meals are extremely healthy.\n\nI like sweets, I've always liked sweets.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm suddenly doing this for the Olympics.\n\nEvery competition, leading up to a competition,\n\nI'm eating sweets the day before.\n\nIt's my version of carb loading.\n\nI don't know if it's actually scientifically proven,\n\nbut it works for me.\n\nClearly it worked, clearly it worked.\n\nSo, man, there's so many moments from,\n\nif we are just gonna talk about the Olympics,\n\none of my favorite moments,\n\nif you could break this down for me is,\n\nit's not even the finals actually, the finals is amazing,\n\nbut it's actually the semi-finals.\n\nYou versus Shigekix.\n\nIt's semi-finals, and just picture this if you can.\n\nBy the way, who watched the Olympics?\n\nWho watched them?\n\nOkay, about half.\n\nAbout half.\n\nOkay, we're doing good.\n\nA little bit.\n\nThat's all right.\n\nYour homework isn't gonna be to watch more.\n\nWe'll talk about this later.\n\nBut this, I think the end of round three\n\nShigekix is doing his thing.\n\nAnd I mean, just imagine this guy,\n\njust power move after power move, I mean every,\n\nwhen you think of breaking, he's doing all that stuff\n\ntimes 10.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\n[Phil] He's incredible.\n\nHe's so good.\n\nAnd then right near the end of his last set,\n\nhe starts stepping and he's doing a few things,\n\nand he starts spinning, and he goes into this rotation\n\nand I see you looking at him, and the camera picks it up,\n\nand he looks at him and he goes from like fan mode\n\njust enjoying what's happening and backing up.\n\nHe says, Hold on.\n\nAnd then all of a sudden you do a handstand\n\nand like go in kind of a split V type thing\n\njust as he does the same thing.\n\nSo basically you predicted his move.\n\nWhich is incredible.\n\nTalk about that.\n\nIt's funny because I think from an outside perspective,\n\nand I didn't know, like I think this went a bit viral.\n\nI saw it on TikTok after like a bunch of times.\n\nBut it's funny, 'cause for us it's not that weird.\n\nLike I've done it to him specifically a bunch of times\n\nin other competitions,\n\nbut I guess it was a bit different\n\n'cause it was on the Olympic platform.\n\nAnd from that angle in which it was shot too, it was like,\n\nI will give myself credit, it was exactly the same move.\n\n[Dexter] It was.\n\nLike the exact same freeze.\n\n[Dexter] It's symmetrical.\n\nBut the thing in breaking is like first,\n\nfor those who don't know, it's a freestyle dance.\n\nSo we don't know what the music being played is gonna be.\n\nSo we just kind of go up there\n\nand you have to adjust to what you're doing.\n\nBut a lot of people, a lot of breakers\n\nwill still pre choreograph their movements,\n\nand so they'll just time it to the music.\n\nShigekix is one of those people.\n\nAnd so the breaking community is quite small.\n\nAnd Shigekix and myself are on the same team.\n\nWe're both sponsored by Red Bull.\n\nSo I've competed with him and against him so many times\n\nthat I know his moves.\n\nLike I know all of his moves.\n\nI knew what he was gonna do.\n\nAnd I think it's like, as a friend,\n\nI probably shouldn't have done that to him\n\nlike on the Olympic stage, but in the heat of the moment,\n\nyou're just like, ah, I know what he's gonna do,\n\nso I'm gonna do it.\n\nMyself personally, I'm a bit of a,\n\nI have a bit of a different approach.\n\nEveryone has their moves,\n\nbut the way I put my moves together\n\nare very different every single time.\n\nAnd I don't even know what I'm gonna do\n\nwhen I show up on that stage, based on the music,\n\nbased on the crowd, based on how I feel,\n\nI change my plan all the time.\n\nAnd so someone couldn't do that to me as easily.\n\nYeah, I mean it's unpredictable.\n\nYou'll go up and you'll do stuff where it's,\n\nis this, is that breaking?\n\nDo y'all do that?\n\nLike the weird rubber band legs thing you're doing.\n\nI mean it's amazing.\n\nSo I mean, again, just to put into context,\n\nI mean imagine Simone Biles, somebody says,\n\nHey, those flips are amazing.\n\nToo many of those, points off.\n\nNobody would ever do that, right?\n\nIt's completely, completely different\n\nif you're talking about it as a sport.\n\nWhich brings me into something else,\n\nwhich would make me think that,\n\nbefore we were talking, and so we spoke\n\nbefore the Olympics, and I remember one of the big\n\nconversations was, within the community,\n\nis breaking being at the Olympics even a good thing?\n\nNow I'm curious, has that,\n\ndid that conversation change before?\n\nHas it changed since?\n\nWhat's the vibe been like?\n\nYeah, I mean, again, for the people that don't know,\n\nbreaking first derives from hip hop culture,\n\nit's been part of the culture since its inception.\n\nAnd breaking traditionally within the world of breaking,\n\nhas been seen as an art and a culture first.\n\nIt's a dance, it's about self-expression.\n\nIt's difficult to go into something like the Olympics\n\nbecause there's, it's so subjective.\n\nIt still is.\n\nIt's based on opinion,\n\nbecause it's, for example, figure skating in the Olympics,\n\nit can be very subjective, it is very artistic,\n\nbut there are certain criteria they have to hit.\n\nIn breaking, there's no criteria that we have to hit.\n\nYou can go up and do whatever you want.\n\nAnd so that makes it very, very subjective.\n\nAnd so that's why that debate is so big.\n\nIs it sport, is it art?\n\nFor myself, I do think the beauty of it\n\nis that it doesn't really matter.\n\nThese are just labels to me.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the beauty of it\n\nis that it can transcend these things.\n\nIt's extremely athletic.\n\nWe see ourselves as athletes,\n\nand we've always seen ourselves as athletes\n\nprior to the Olympics.\n\nBut at the same time we see ourselves as artists too.\n\nIt's about self-expression.\n\nIt's about finding your style, finding your individuality.\n\nAnd those are the people that are celebrated\n\nwithin the dance.\n\nAnd so we have a common saying within the world of breaking\n\nthat I kind of have adopted as well,\n\nand that I kind of live by is like train like an athlete,\n\nbut think like an artist.\n\nAnd so I think the beauty, again, of breaking\n\nis that it can transcend those labels\n\nand it can live within those two parallels.\n\nI remember you were saying, I mean,\n\n'cause some of the worry that about breaking\n\nbeing at the Olympics was that okay,\n\nis mainstreaming this going to dilute it?\n\nIs a bunch of outsiders going to,\n\nbasically we're talking about selling out here, right?\n\nSo the Olympics have come and gone.\n\nHow do people feel?\n\nWas it, because we were talking about,\n\nthis is gonna provide opportunities for people.\n\nHas it?\n\nDefinitely, I mean, I can only speak\n\nfrom my own experience and those\n\nthat I kind of have close around me,\n\nbut it definitely has opened up a lot of doors for people.\n\nIt's opened up a lot of narratives\n\nand opportunities, like speaking here,\n\nthat we never could have done prior.\n\nSo we can speak about breaking on a bigger platform.\n\nThere are opinions on breaking\n\nafter the Olympic games for many reasons.\n\nAnd we can have the opportunities to speak on that\n\nand to talk about the culture, to talk about the fact\n\nthat for us it's not just a sport.\n\nSo yes, and I will say there are messy parts to it too.\n\nOf course, going into the Olympics,\n\ncoming outta the Olympics, there are things that,\n\nwhen I look back, I was like,\n\nthat could have been done way better.\n\nThis could have been done way better.\n\nBut that's with anything.\n\nNothing's ever going to be perfect.\n\nBut at the end of the day, again,\n\nI can only speak from my personal experience.\n\nI do think it is a net positive, but you never know.\n\nOkay, you opened that window,\n\nit could have been done better.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThere's a lot of things that were a bit disorganized\n\nin the process.\n\nWhen you're an athlete competing in it too,\n\nyou don't really look too deeply into it,\n\nbecause you're so focused on your competition\n\nand what you're competing at.\n\nI mean, we've always talked about this before.\n\nI know the people that kind of have been running\n\nthe Olympics, they're good friends of mine,\n\nthey're great people, but there are things\n\nthat maybe shouldn't have been done, certain judges\n\nthat shouldn't have been there, whatever.\n\nBut I also understand that I don't understand\n\nthe whole political and geopolitical like environments\n\nsurrounding that.\n\nSo I can't fully judge,\n\nbecause I don't know the full picture.\n\nBut there are things for myself as a competitor\n\nthat I think could have probably been done better.\n\nSo we've kind of danced around this a little bit\n\nand I wanna address the kangaroo shaped elephant\n\nin the room.\n\nAnd unfortunately, I mean I felt this right?\n\nI felt this when I told people,\n\nI talked to this guy who I think he's gonna get gold,\n\nand then the conversation immediately turns over to,\n\nif you're not familiar, Australian breaker Raygun,\n\nwho a lot of people had a lot of feelings about.\n\n[Phil] Yes.\n\nHow has that conversation been within the scene?\n\nYeah, I mean it's hard,\n\nbecause I get this question a lot now.\n\nI bet you do.\n\nBut it's okay.\n\nHonestly, I don't mind talking about it,\n\nlike first and foremost, I don't think anyone deserves\n\nthe amount of hate that she got.\n\nLike no one deserves to be bullied.\n\nThat's just internet culture.\n\nThat's meme culture.\n\nNo one deserves that kind of hate.\n\nBut this is probably one of the problems\n\nthat isn't necessarily just for breaking.\n\nI know it's inherent in other sports as well.\n\nIt was just more inherent in breaking\n\nbecause it was the debut of breaking.\n\nAnd again, we're going in as a sport\n\nthat no one really understands going into it,\n\nthere's a lot of negativity already being like,\n\nwhy is this even there?\n\nBut it happens in other sports.\n\nEssentially why she qualified was because\n\nthere's continental qualifiers,\n\nand they had to do continental qualifiers.\n\nSo she won the Oceania qualifier.\n\nTraditionally in breaking, there aren't a lot\n\nof breakers in Oceania in general, the scene is very small,\n\nand there's no one that's really high level.\n\nFrom my understanding too,\n\nbecause of the nature of things,\n\nit was put together very last minute.\n\nAnd so the opportunity for other people around Oceania\n\nto even go to the qualifier,\n\nwhich happened in Australia, was quite low.\n\nSo she was the best of the bunch that were there,\n\nbut the amount of people that were there\n\nI think was quite low.\n\nAnd so she rightfully earned her spot,\n\nbut she was not at the level of the other competitors\n\nat all.\n\nAnd I think the unfortunate thing is,\n\nwhen you look at the B-Girl category specific,\n\nI was there live, like it was some of the top level B-Girls,\n\nespecially on the second half,\n\nwhen you go from top eight onwards,\n\nthe level was incredible.\n\nAnd it was beautiful to watch.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the narrative was all focused on her.\n\nAnd when I say it's happened in other sports,\n\nfrom my understanding in things like swimming this happens,\n\nwhere there are certain people that shouldn't be there,\n\nbut because of how qualifications work,\n\ncertain countries get kind of like buys.\n\nBut in something like swimming,\n\nyou can see the gap.\n\nLike you can see the distance, you can see like,\n\noh, this person is significantly worse\n\nthan the other people.\n\nBut that's a little bit more difficult\n\nto understand in breaking.\n\nBut because of that meme culture,\n\na lot of things kind of came up out of it.\n\nYeah, well I guess that's what takes me\n\nto kind of wrap this question then is over,\n\nyou said that the Olympics has been a net positive.\n\nWhat I've seen is a lot of people,\n\nif you ask them about breaking in the Olympics,\n\nthe one thing they know about is,\n\nand it's not even her full set, it's like a super cut.\n\nIt's all the bad parts because yo, there's some parts,\n\nand I challenge anybody in this room\n\nto do some of the moves that she was doing.\n\nYou cannot do them unless you actually are a B-Boy B-Girl,\n\nat which point come on up and show us your thing.\n\nBut it's this really concentrated,\n\nconcentrated viral moment\n\nwhen there was so much else.\n\nIs there any concern, I guess,\n\nis what I'm asking, is that that will be\n\nwhat people have taken away from break?\n\nYeah, I mean again, that's just the reality\n\nof meme culture in the internet nowadays.\n\nLike you said, it's a super cut.\n\nNo one, it's the same thing with interviews.\n\nPeople will take things out of context.\n\nIt's the exact same thing that happened\n\nwith the Raygun thing.\n\nThey just took the super cut of her bad parts\n\nand put it on the internet.\n\nDo I think it's bad?\n\nYes, I do think it's a bad, I personally,\n\nlike I do think it's a bit embarrassing for breaking\n\nbecause people will kind of walk away\n\nwith the Olympics thinking this is what breaking was\n\nat the Olympics moving forward.\n\nSo I don't think that that is the best for us.\n\nBut again, I think there's opportunities like this\n\nto kind of change the narrative and talk about it.\n\nHopefully that happens moving forward,\n\nand hopefully, again, Raygun honestly stops getting bullied\n\nand has the opportunity to talk about it more as well.\n\nSo we'll see what happens.\n\nYeah, and another thing to be cleared up,\n\nit was already set before the Olympics even happened,\n\nthat the breaking would not be an event in 2028.\n\n[Phil] It was not because of her performance.\n\nIt was not because of her performance.\n\nBut let's be real,\n\nlike there's a lot of misinformation out here.\n\nExactly, yeah.\n\nSo let's say that you could wave a wand\n\nand breaking would be in 2028.\n\nWould you want that?\n\nIn the 2028 Olympics in LA?\n\nIt's a good question.\n\nYes, the simple answer is yes.\n\nBut I think within those four years\n\na lot would have to change.\n\nLike what?\n\nJust the way qualifications work.\n\nAnd again, I think coming in as a new sport\n\nand it coming in pretty quickly,\n\nthere are adaptations that are difficult to make\n\nin a short amount of time.\n\nI think after having experienced it once,\n\nI would be an advocate for like,\n\nthings need to change for the next one.\n\nThere has to be a lot more transparency.\n\nWe can even just talk about problems within breaking\n\nthat have been around for a long time,\n\nbut now that are pushed to the spotlight more\n\nwith a platform like this in the sense that like,\n\nwhen you go to a breaking competition,\n\nthe judging panel and the judging system\n\nfor the Olympics is just red or blue.\n\nLike it just says who the judge voted for.\n\nThat needs to be more transparent, especially for people\n\nwho don't understand breaking.\n\nNot this person won, why did they win?\n\nBy what margin, by what reason?\n\nAnd I think those kind of things need to change.\n\nThere's a lot of just technical details.\n\nBut I think again, if it were to come back in the future,\n\nI think it would be a cool thing,\n\nbut it would just mean that we would have to put in\n\na lot more work to make that more transparent\n\nand more easily understandable for people.\n\nAnd I think that's why it's almost a blessing in disguise,\n\nbecause there's a lot of problems that have been spotlighted\n\nfor us within breaking that we never thought about before.\n\nBecause for us as breakers,\n\nwe understand all of this already.\n\nI know why this person lost or won, I can see it.\n\nBut when someone else who doesn't watch breaking,\n\nit doesn't happen often that there are a lot of people\n\nwho don't watch breaking,\n\nespecially at the scale of the Olympics, recognizing like,\n\noh, right, these people don't know this.\n\nLike even the idea, people came up\n\nto me and be like, oh, you know\n\nwhat music's gonna be played, right?\n\nWhen someone first asked me that, I was like,\n\nwhat are you talking about?\n\nLike breaking's a freestyle dance?\n\nAnd it made me realize like, oh right,\n\npeople don't know about this.\n\nPeople don't understand this.\n\nSo it just addresses a lot of things that,\n\nmyself included, that I didn't know as problems\n\nuntil it's put on such a big stage like this.\n\nIt's really interesting to me that you have,\n\nnot only are you truly at the top of the game,\n\ntop level of this,\n\nbut also that you're still needing to explain this\n\nto everybody.\n\nI mean like, imagine LeBron James\n\njust like doing what he does and then jumping up\n\nin the announcer's box and saying, okay everybody,\n\nwhat I just did, this is why it was cool.\n\nLike it's amazing.\n\nYeah, but I think that's okay too,\n\nbecause I understand that, again,\n\npeople don't understand this,\n\nand it takes a lot to understand.\n\nTo the naked eye, watching breaking,\n\nyou'll be impressed by the things that are,\n\nof course, physically impressive.\n\nPeople spinning on their heads,\n\npeople doing these crazy movements.\n\nBut there are so many details and layers to breaking that,\n\nmyself included, only understand after years\n\nof being into it and actually learning the dance\n\nand understanding why other things are actually\n\nsignificantly more difficult creatively as well.\n\nBut to the naked eye, they won't understand.\n\nI'm happy to talk about that.\n\nI'm a nerd about breaking,\n\nlike I love breaking, I still watch it to this day.\n\nThe people I compete with and against, I still fanboy over.\n\nLike some of my best friends I grew up watching them.\n\nAnd so for me, it's still surreal to me.\n\nAnd I'm happy to open that door for other people if I can.\n\nSo this will be my last question then,\n\nbecause we can talk about this all day.\n\nYou already know me.\n\nSo being that breaking is a part of hip hop culture.\n\nAnd I think there's, I think the older the person is,\n\nthe more connection to that they feel, you know what I mean?\n\nAnd I think the younger we get,\n\nwe feel like rap is something different.\n\nBreaking is something different.\n\nDJing is something different, right?\n\nDo you feel like, in the future,\n\nbecause you're at the point now where you,\n\nyou still got, if Olympics come back, you still got\n\n2, 3, 4 Olympics left in you, definitely.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nNah man, but you're at the point now where there's kids\n\nwho are looking up to you,\n\nwhere maybe you are the first YouTube video that they see.\n\nAnd they're looking at you like, How can I be like Phil?\n\nAnd so is there a way for you,\n\nlooking at the next generation, that breaking, the rap,\n\nthat everything else comes together\n\nand we stop being distant cousins,\n\nand we start being more like hip hop as a culture again.\n\nIs that on the horizon for you?\n\nI mean, I think that would be cool.\n\nI will be completely honest, even for myself,\n\nI know I'm way more disjointed to hip hop\n\nthan I probably should be.\n\nAnd again, like you said, as the generations get younger,\n\nthose things tend to separate a lot more.\n\nBut I think that's not just the job of breaking,\n\nthat's the job of the rappers, that's the job of the MCs,\n\nthe DJs, and the graffiti writers\n\nto bring that all together.\n\nBut it's hard because it does get disjointed\n\nand history gets blurred as the generations kind of move on.\n\nEven within the context of breaking,\n\nthere were some hip hop artists and rappers that came out\n\nand be like, Yo breaking is in the Olympics, this is cool.\n\nBut then there are other people being like,\n\nYo, that's whack.\n\nLike artists, like rap artists.\n\nSo it does, I don't think it's just our job.\n\nI think it's something that we should push,\n\nbecause history's extremely important.\n\nAnd to recognize where this comes from is to understand\n\nwhere that energy comes from.\n\nAnd what you were saying even before\n\nthe context of break dancing and breaking,\n\nwhy it's so important is because of history.\n\nBecause the reason it's called breaking\n\nis because they would dance on the break of a record.\n\nSo they would dance, the DJ would loop the break,\n\nso they would have two records of the same song,\n\nand they would loop the break.\n\nAnd on that break was the hypest part,\n\nit was when the drums were played.\n\nAnd so the dancers would start dancing.\n\nSo they would dance on the break of the song.\n\nThat's why we're called breakers, right.\n\nAnd because of that, the reason it's so important,\n\nfor some people you might see it as just a name,\n\nbut the reason is because of is context.\n\nIt's why this dance started.\n\nAnd that gets diluted further down you go.\n\nThe reason it's called break dancing\n\nis 'cause the media saw it and they were like,\n\nyou're just break dancing, you're breaking your bones\n\nand you're doing this crazy stuff.\n\nSo we're gonna call it break dancing.\n\nThat's why it's called break dancing, right?\n\nBut as generations keep moving forward,\n\nthat history gets diluted.\n\nSo it's important to understand that.\n\nTo understand where it comes from,\n\nto understand that that's where the energy came from.\n\nThat's why it's called what it's called.\n\nThat's why history is important.\n\nAnd I know myself, I have to do a better job of looking back\n\nand understanding that even more than I do now.\n\nAnd I know for future generations,\n\nit's my job then to teach that.\n\nBecause if you don't teach it,\n\nthen you start losing it.\n\nSo I do think that's a responsibility of anyone\n\nwho has a platform like myself,\n\nor any high level breaker.\n\nBut I also understand that I can do a better job of it\n\nas well.\n\nThank you so much my man.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[Phil laughs]\n\nThank you so much Dexter, thank you for having me.\n\n[audience applauds]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nThese controversial surveillance devices are designed\n\nto alert authorities to gunshots,\n\nand their exact locations have been kept hidden\n\nfrom police and the public until now.\n\nWIRED obtained leaked documents\n\nthat reveal for the first time the secret locations\n\nof 25,580 ShotSpotter microphones.\n\nIn this video, we'll analyze that data\n\nand test the claim of activists that these sensors lead\n\nto biased over-policing\n\nof communities of color across America.\n\n12 million Americans live in a neighborhood\n\nwith at least one ShotSpotter microphone.\n\nAre you one of them?\n\nLet's put ShotSpotter secret locations on the grid.\n\n[mellow music]\n\n[graphics whirring] [mellow music]\n\nThis is just one of the 25,580 data points\n\nthat represent ShotSpotter microphone locations\n\nas indicated in the leaked documents\n\nprovided to me earlier this year\n\nby a source under the condition of anonymity.\n\nTo confirm that the leaked data was legit,\n\nWIRED vetted the locations\n\nby physically visiting sensors in different cities,\n\nincluding Pasadena, California, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n[Reporter] I think that's it on top of the pole.\n\n[Dhruv] Miami, Florida.\n\n[Reporter] There it is. I see it.\n\nAnd this one attached to a street lamp near Prospect Park\n\nin Brooklyn, New York,\n\nwhere we spotted the protective casing\n\nthat houses the acoustic sensors and processors.\n\nWe even used Google Street View\n\nto virtually visit a random sample\n\nof locations in the document,\n\nand they check out.\n\nThe sensors were exactly where the leaked data\n\nsaid that they would be.\n\nWe don't know if our data set\n\nincludes all sensors that exist,\n\nbut Tom Chittum from SoundThinking,\n\nthe company that makes them,\n\nsaid that as of February 2023,\n\nthe document was likely authentic.\n\nThe data set represents\n\nover a thousand elementary and high schools,\n\ndozens of billboards, scores of hospitals,\n\nand more than a hundred public housing complexes\n\nwhere the sensors are placed.\n\nIn total, the leaked document\n\nindicates ShotSpotter locations\n\nin 84 metropolitan areas across 34 states,\n\nplus US territories such as Puerto Rico\n\nand the Virgin Islands.\n\nNine US cities actually have\n\nmore than 500 sensors installed,\n\nincluding Albuquerque, New Mexico,\n\nChicago, Illinois, Las Vegas, Nevada,\n\nand Washington, D.C.,\n\nwhere sensors can be found on US government buildings,\n\nincluding the headquarters of the FBI,\n\nthe Department of Justice, the US Court of Appeals,\n\nand just outside the city\n\nthroughout the campus of the University of Maryland.\n\nSo why are specific locations chosen for ShotSpotter?\n\nAccording to Tom Chittum,\n\nwhen police departments purchase SoundThinking services,\n\nthey provide the company with data\n\nabout gun violence in the area.\n\nOnce a plan is agreed upon by the department,\n\nSoundThinking will seek permission\n\nfrom private property owners, utility companies,\n\nand business owners\n\nto install sensors on their premises.\n\nWhile Chittum says that most property owners\n\nagree to do so without needing incentivization,\n\nthe company will occasionally offer gift cards\n\nto secure access to their private property.\n\nAccording to the company,\n\nif a loud, impulsive sound is heard in the coverage area,\n\nsensors often on top of buildings\n\nand streetlights pick it up.\n\nThe location of the incident is determined\n\nby measuring the time the sound takes\n\nto travel to each sensor.\n\nAt minimum, three sensors need to detect a sound\n\nfor it to be flagged.\n\nThe sound is then first analyzed by AI\n\nto determine if it's likely a gunshot\n\nbefore being sent to a ShotSpotter incident review center\n\nwhere analysts determine whether it's gunfire\n\nor something else,\n\nlike a firework or a car backfiring.\n\nIf it's a gunshot,\n\nShotSpotter then alerts law enforcement.\n\nSoundThinking claims they keep the exact locations\n\nof their sensors secret, even from police,\n\nto protect people who allow the sensors on their property\n\nas well as to prevent the mics themselves\n\nfrom being tampered with or vandalized.\n\nBut this secrecy has been a point of contention\n\nfor those who criticize the company.\n\n[Protestors] DPD we want you out.\n\n[Dhruv] The ACLU argues that, quote,\n\nThere are deep problems\n\nwith the gunshot detection company\n\nand its technology,\n\nincluding its methodology, effectiveness,\n\nand impact on communities of color.\n\nSo are activists right?\n\nWhere are these microphones being placed?\n\nWIRED did some digging and found the answer.\n\nAfter receiving the leaked documents\n\nof the sensor locations,\n\nwe used the most recent census data\n\nand collected the demographic information\n\nfrom every census block group\n\nwith at least one SoundThinking sensor.\n\nEach census block group\n\nhas between 600 and 3,000 people in it.\n\nWe then analyzed sensor distribution in US cities\n\nand found that, in aggregate, 70% of people\n\nwho live in a neighborhood\n\nwith at least one SoundThinking sensor\n\nidentified as either Black or Latino,\n\nnearly 3/4 of these neighborhoods are majority non-white,\n\nand the average household earns\n\na little more than 50,000 a year.\n\nBut let's zoom in and look at individual jurisdictions.\n\nThe pattern appears to be the same.\n\nWinston-Salem, North Carolina, for example,\n\nis approximately 43% white,\n\nbut only 13% of residents who live in areas\n\nthat have at least one ShotSpotter sensor\n\nidentified as white.\n\nIn Fort Myers, Florida,\n\nroughly 19% of the population is Black.\n\nIn block groups with at least one sensor, however,\n\napproximately 41% of the population is Black.\n\nSo WIRED's findings do align\n\nwith the theory put forth by activists and critics\n\nthat ShotSpotter surveillance does disproportionately occur\n\nin poor communities of color.\n\nWhy invest in ShotSpotter\n\nwhen it's shown it doesn't curb gun violence,\n\nit doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do?\n\nSo what happens when police answer a call\n\nbased on a ShotSpotter report in one of these neighborhoods?\n\nLet's go to Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIt's New Year's Eve 2022, 8:21 p.m.\n\nSeveral sensors pick up two loud sounds\n\nthat could be gunshots.\n\nThis is body cam footage\n\nthat WIRED obtained of the incident.\n\nYou can see police detaining a man\n\nwho happened to be standing near the corner\n\nwhere the ShotSpotter mics detected supposed gunfire.\n\nNine officers were sent to the location to respond.\n\nHowever, once there, they found no gun,\n\nno bullet casings, no bullet holes,\n\nnor any evidence that a crime had been committed there.\n\n[Officer] So we kind of did about 10 feet out\n\nand there's nothing, unless he had a revolver.\n\nYet cops still arrested man after they ran his name\n\nand found he'd failed to appear in court\n\nfor traffic violations.\n\nThis incident tracks with a 2021\n\nNorthwestern University School of Law study\n\nwhich found that over a two-year period,\n\n89% of alerts in the city of Chicago did not result\n\nin police finding evidence of a gun-related crime.\n\nThis is likely at least in part due\n\nto how often suspected gunfire alerts\n\nend up being something else entirely.\n\nFor example, according to this article,\n\nofficers in Pasadena responding\n\nto scenes of ShotSpotter alerts\n\nhave pointed to backfiring cars, fireworks,\n\nor even noisy construction as the actual sources\n\nof the sounds the sensors detected,\n\nand that's when the sensors were actually working.\n\n[mellow music]\n\nIn December 2022, SoundThinking sensors failed\n\nto issue an alert for a shooting at a gyros shop in Chicago\n\nthat wounded two men.\n\nReportedly, 55 rounds were fired,\n\nyet SoundThinking's equipment sent out no alerts.\n\nThe missed detections were apparently due\n\nto three out-of-service sensors.\n\nIn fact, according to the leaked document,\n\nas many as 357 sensors in the Chicago metropolitan area\n\nwere broken, unreliable, or out of service at the time.\n\nThat's 9% of the total sensors in the city.\n\n2,680 of SoundThinking sensors nationwide, one in 10,\n\nwere categorized as either broken, unreliable,\n\nor out of service at the time the file was created,\n\nallegedly late last year.\n\nThis past September, Mayor Brandon Johnson,\n\na vocal critic of ShotSpotter,\n\nsaid the city will not renew\n\nits contract with SoundThinking.\n\nOn a side note, one interesting use case for ShotSpotter\n\ncan be found way across the world in South Africa.\n\nThe Kruger National Park,\n\none of the most renowned wildlife conservation areas\n\nin the world,\n\nhas sensors throughout its grounds,\n\npresumably to curb the poaching of endangered species.\n\nWanna see if there's a ShotSpotter near you?\n\nClick on the WIRED article in this video's description\n\nand search the data yourself.\n\nI'm Dhruv Mehrotra.\n\nThanks for watching On the Grid.\n\n[mellow music]",

Nought 16, two and a half seconds.\n\n800 horsepower.\n\nThis thing is a hyper car for the waves.\n\nCut to me screaming.\n\n[host screams]\n\nWarp speed!\n\nOh my Lord!\n\nIt's like light bending around you!\n\n[classical music continues]\n\nBlimey! Oh-ho!\n\nShadow Six. The company that makes crazy vehicles,\n\nincluding a super special new watercraft,\n\nunlike anything you've seen before.\n\nLet's go inside,\n\nand meet the people that make these monster machines.\n\nHey.\n\nNice to meet you. Nice to meet you.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nTell us a little bit about\n\nwhat Shadow Six actually is.\n\nShadow Six essentially started out\n\nwhere I was developing the original Typhoon for myself\n\nand very quickly realized lots\n\nof other people were interested\n\nand that led into quite a few other inventions\n\nand vehicles that we've developed for other individuals\n\nthat have bad ideas like myself.\n\nLet's take a look at some of those. Shall we?\n\nYeah. Let's do it.\n\nShow me a few that you've got here.\n\nYou got it.\n\n[Jeremy] Start with this one.\n\n[Ryan] Yeah. What's this?\n\nSo this is an autonomous cooler that somebody can ride on\n\nor you can actually use an app\n\nand it knows what beverages are inside.\n\nIt's got full surround sound, through wet sounds.\n\nIt's a floating cooler. It is.\n\nWith propellers.\n\nIt is, yeah.\n\nI recognize this. Is it a Ninebot?\n\nIt is. Yeah.\n\nSo we put tank treads on the back\n\nand we put air inflated tires on the front\n\nand now it's able to climb over all kinds of things\n\nthat it wasn't, and it's able to get in the sand and go\n\nand it's able to to travel through the yard\n\nand travel through grass without any problem.\n\nIt all started with the Typhoon, didn't it?\n\nThat's what, that's the...\n\nAnd you know, can we get a shot of these?\n\n'cause these are the...\n\nAre these are these the original drawings?\n\n[Ryan] They are.\n\n[Jeremy] Are they your drawings?\n\n[Ryan] They are.\n\n[Jeremy] What were you thinking\n\nwhen you came up with that? [laughs]\n\nYeah. I was about two, three months out\n\nfrom my son's third birthday\n\nand I asked him what he wanted to do for his birthday\n\nand he told me he wanted to go\n\nto Las Vegas for a guy's trip.\n\nAnd then he explained to me\n\nthat the Monster Jam World finals were there.\n\nHe saw a billboard on the way home\n\nand it said Polaris Adventure,\n\nwhere you basically drive a Razor\n\n[Jeremy] On the dunes.\n\nYeah, out in the dunes.\n\nHe absolutely loved it.\n\nAnd that kind of got me intrigued in the idea\n\nof side by sides, and the suspension.\n\nFast forward about two months later,\n\nI went to The Bahamas with my wife.\n\nWe went out and rode a WaveRunner\n\nand I kind of had this epiphany\n\nthat combining the two together\n\nwould really make for a fun toy.\n\nSo right at that moment you thought, hang on a minute.\n\nIf I put two wave riders underneath the body\n\nof a side by side, I could be on to something.\n\nExactly.\n\nNow that we know the genesis of the idea,\n\nwhere it came from, I'm dying to see it.\n\nCome on. You got it.\n\nLet's see it. Come on.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Let's go.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nHere it is.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIt's big. [laughs]\n\n[Ryan] It is.\n\n[host laughs]\n\nI've seen it on screen,\n\nbut it doesn't quite prepare you\n\nfor seeing it in the metal, as it were.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike it's crazy.\n\nNow the typhoon may be big,\n\nbut is it desirable?\n\nAnd that's what we are here to find out.\n\nWhat Shadow Six has built does not fit\n\ninto the usual realm of luxury gear.\n\nThere's no bling here, no collaboration with Hermes\n\nor Ferrari.\n\nWhat the typhoon does have in spades though is exclusivity.\n\nOnly Shadow Six makes it and it's so far ahead\n\nof anything else you might try and compare it to,\n\nit simply blows all competition outta the water.\n\nTell us a bit about these, what power have they got?\n\nWhy are they so long?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, what's going on here?\n\nThe hulls ultimately are, size-wise,\n\ndictated by keeping the shape of a triangle.\n\nWhat that does is it gives you the strongest shape\n\nin the world, but ultimately takes all the force\n\nthat would typically be exerted on the bottom of the hull\n\nand sends it up through the suspension\n\nand in through the cage on top of the chassis.\n\nSo inside here,\n\nthis isn't an electric vehicle, is it?\n\nThis is not.\n\nWhat've we got inside?\n\nWe've got two Yamaha, 1.8 liter GP 1800 RSVHL engines,\n\nand each one of these engines\n\nputs out a little under 400 horsepower.\n\nSo a total of 800. Yeah.\n\nAnd they're tuned. Are they?\n\nAnd they're tuned. Yep, they are. Yep.\n\nOkay. As we go around, obviously the things\n\nthat you cannot get away from is this significant cage\n\nthat you've got all the way around this.\n\nNow this, is this titanium?\n\n[Ryan] It's all titanium, yeah.\n\nOkay. And that's for weight of course.\n\nSo strength, weight,\n\nand also because of the molecular bond structure,\n\nit's very similar to aluminum\n\nin that it's a four-way bond\n\nand because of that it's non-magnetic\n\nand it won't corrode in the ocean.\n\nYou know, you're looking at exerting\n\nsomewhere near 20,000 pounds of static load on any one\n\nof these four corners at any given time.\n\nThe roll cage up top, is that for protection\n\nof the passengers inside the drive in the passenger?\n\nIt's not. It's actually there for structural rigidity.\n\nSo without that cage, because all of the energy from waves\n\nand jumping the vehicle,\n\ngets sent up through the suspension,\n\nit would cause the chassis to crumple on itself\n\nwithout having the upper portion of the cage.\n\nWow.\n\nHow does the suspension actually work?\n\nThe suspension itself is what's actually articulating.\n\nIn the front,\n\nthe suspension holds both of the hulls identically parallel\n\nthrough the full range of motion.\n\nAnd in the rear, you've got a series of joints\n\nand bearings that allow the rear suspension\n\nto actually travel out and up\n\nand then return to center,\n\nonce the vehicle's back on the water.\n\nHave you taken the suspension from anything else\n\nor have you come up with this?\n\nNope. It's entirely proprietary.\n\nIs it patented? It is.\n\nI think we've got around 30 patents now, 30 plus,\n\nbetween all the different aspects of the vehicles.\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nImpressive as it is,\n\nyou clearly can't do all this on your own.\n\nWho have you been working with?\n\nYou've got some guys here.\n\nYeah, so I've got two of our head fabricators here.\n\nWilson is in charge of all of our composites\n\nand carbon fiber and fiberglass.\n\nAnd then we've got Mike.\n\nHey.\n\nAnd it was an awful lot of fabrication.\n\nWell, I've got a million questions really,\n\nbut let's start with, it doesn't need the roll cage\n\nin order to protect the passengers.\n\nBut how does, I can't...\n\nCan I tip this over if I really tried?\n\nI don't think so,\n\n'cause all the weight is in the bottom.\n\nThe weight is all in the...so.\n\nWell hang on a minute.\n\nMost of it, it looks like most of the weight is up here.\n\nLooks like most of the weight's up there,\n\nbut all the weight is below the water line\n\nwith their four cylinder engine.\n\nSo it's like the engine of a small car.\n\nSo it's pretty heavy.\n\nThe titanium chassis weighs 143 pounds.\n\nAnd what's below the water line?\n\nBelow the water, each jet ski is around like 900 pounds.\n\n[Jeremy] Oh, I see. So like around 80%\n\nof the total vehicle's weight is here.\n\nIt's below the water.\n\n[Mike] It's below the water.\n\nAnd that's why it doesn't tip over?\n\nThat's why it won't tip over. Right.\n\nHere's a sample of titanium.\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nSo the entire chassis is made of that.\n\nThat, it weighs...That weighs virtually nothing.\n\nSo it's stronger than steel. Lighter than steel\n\nWon't corrode And it won't corrode.\n\nThat's the main thing, is it won't corrode\n\nWith such a bespoke architecture, it's no surprise\n\nthat each Typhoon takes nearly 1000 hours to build,\n\nwhich is why you'll have\n\nto part with a quarter of a million dollars to own one.\n\nAnd that's more than a Ferrari Roma\n\nor an Aston Martin DB 12 coupe.\n\nAnd Ryan, this isn't pocket change,\n\nthis is a seriously high-end vehicle.\n\nSo who are you selling them to?\n\nProbably the lowest net worth I can imagine\n\nof anybody who's really reached out\n\nand wanted to purchase a vehicle is in excess\n\nof a hundred million dollars in net worth.\n\nSo the customer that has the least money\n\nthat's bought one of these\n\nis worth a hundred million dollars?\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd it goes up from there?\n\nAnd it goes up from there.\n\nOkay. So royalty?\n\nSome, yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah.\n\n[host laughs]\n\nOkay. I've got two more questions.\n\nDid you even consider though,\n\nmaking this electric rather than TCE?\n\nYeah, it's definitely something we're extremely\n\ninterested in as a company.\n\nThe reality of it is, is that electrification is very heavy\n\nand doesn't really offer the performance\n\nthat we're getting out of a traditional combustion engine.\n\nNot yet anyway. Not yet at least.\n\nAnd so I think as hydrogen fuel cells come online\n\nand become more available,\n\nwe'll slowly progress into looking at electrification\n\nof these vehicles.\n\nBut what was happened in making the typhoon\n\nthat you just thought,\n\nI've never thought that was going to be the case?\n\nOne of the most shocking things ultimately came\n\nfrom the adjustments in the suspension\n\nand finding that setting suspension up\n\nfor salt water was different\n\nthan setting it up for the fresh water.\n\nAnd that's all based on the buoyancy of the water itself.\n\nYou're gonna get a little bit more\n\nof a stiff ride in the ocean\n\nbecause of the additional buoyancy.\n\nAnd so we wanna set it a little softer in salt water\n\nthan we do in fresh water.\n\nAnd you know, that gives you a little bit better response\n\nin terms of getting into turns and cornering at high speeds.\n\nHow many of these are in the wild right now?\n\nSo there were nine pre-production units,\n\nand we kept one of the vehicles, which we're looking at now,\n\nwhich was the final pre-production unit.\n\nSo there's eight out there in the world?\n\n[Ryan] There are. That's it.\n\nAnd we get to drive this one?\n\nYep, we get to drive this one.\n\nI've gotta have a go.\n\n[dramatic classical music]\n\nOkay. If the Typhoon is good enough for actual royalty,\n\nit's good enough for Wired.\n\nBut to be honest, I was nervous\n\nabout getting in this crazy watercraft.\n\nSomething Ryan is calling\n\nthe world's first aquatic utility vehicle.\n\nI've been in supercars\n\nthat could do nought to sixty in two\n\nand a half seconds and that's petrifying enough on a runway.\n\nDoing those speeds on water in something that looks\n\nlike it's driven off a sand dune seems like madness.\n\nAnd more than a little dangerous.\n\nI've been in fancy cars with worse seats than these.\n\nThis is great.\n\nAh, so this is the wearable.\n\nYep.\n\nSo it's a dead man switch, isn't it?\n\nYep.\n\nSo it's if you go out,\n\nthen if it's not in the proximity of the vehicle,\n\nthe vehicle stops.\n\nYep. But it's also a GPS tracker.\n\nYou got it. Exactly.\n\nAnd same thing with the brain inside of the actual vessel.\n\nSo it'll tell the coast guard both where you are\n\nand where you've drifted and what the currents are like\n\nas well as where the machine is.\n\n[Typhoon engine revs]\n\nI think we should play this.\n\nWhoa!\n\n[Typhoon engine revs]\n\n[Jeremy exclaims]\n\nBlimey!\n\nWhoa!\n\nHow can you see?\n\nHow can you see in this thing? [laughs]\n\nThis is the impressive bit,\n\nhow when you're turning, it's crazy.\n\n[Ryan] It's stable, yep.\n\nIt stays perfectly level\n\nand everything actually works on it.\n\n[Jeremy] Whoa! Geez!\n\nBlimey!\n\nAnd how is it stopping?\n\nSo all gotta do is pull up the throttle\n\nand then, you know, essentially\n\nwhat's happening is it's coming out of the water.\n\nSo what you feel is the thing going back down\n\nand laying back in the water again.\n\nSo is it just the friction of the water stopping you?\n\nJust the water stopping you, yep.\n\nSo it feels like you're putting brakes on.\n\nNope, that's no brake.\n\nNo?\n\nA brake will stop it way faster.\n\nWhich, you probably don't want to use it. I mean...\n\nNo.\n\nWarp speed!\n\nHell!\n\nJesus Christ!\n\n[dramatic classical music]\n\n[Jeremy whoops]\n\nOh geez.\n\nOh my god.\n\n[Ryan] That guy's still fishing. Yeah.\n\nOh geez! Oh my God!\n\nIt's like light bending around you!\n\n[Jeremy exclaims]\n\nAlright. Okay. I'm just, yeah, I'm just going to...\n\nI'm just gonna have a bit of dry land.\n\n[Ryan laughs] Just for a sec.\n\nIt really is a feat of engineering.\n\n[Ryan] Yeah.\n\nAnd like, and as I said,\n\nand you know, you guys have done it all.\n\nNo one's done this before.\n\nAll these patents, you've sorted it all out yourself\n\nand it genuinely delivers on what you actually say.\n\nAnd I know you're prepared for the speed,\n\nbut you're not, you're not really,\n\nYeah, no, nothing can really prepare you for it.\n\nJust nothing else is like it, in my opinion.\n\nSo you ready to give it a try?\n\nI am actually ready to give it a try. [chuckles]\n\nBut what I'd like to do is that,\n\nthat's an electric jet ski in your shop.\n\nCould we actually race the two?\n\nI wanna see how electric does against this.\n\n[Ryan] You got it.\n\n[Jeremy] I've always been Team Electric\n\nwhen it comes to Wired's vehicles\n\nand I revel in telling petrolheads\n\nhow EV acceleration leaves combustion cars in the dust.\n\nSo when I saw the Stealth Evo in Ryan's workshop,\n\nI just had to see how it would hold up\n\nagainst the Typhoon's fearsome powertrain.\n\nIt didn't go well.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nA hypercar for the water, so they say.\n\nWhat the hell am I doing?\n\nAlright, they're ready.\n\nI don't know that I'm gonna win\n\neven with a rolling start, so.\n\n3, 2. 2, 1.\n\nGo!\n\n[dramatic music continues]\n\n[Jeremy] Oh my god!\n\n[Jeremy yells inaudibly]\n\n[Birds sing]\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nAnd again! And again!\n\n[engines rev]\n\nOh fucking hell!\n\nGlued to the water.\n\nGlued to the water.\n\n[Director] Hi Jeremy, can you hear me?\n\nI can, I can.\n\nWell, electric didn't win that one.\n\nI can hear you, yeah.\n\n[Director] I think you won that one.\n\n[birds sing]\n\n[Jeremy] So we've come to the end of our day\n\nwith the astonishing Typhoon.\n\nI've really never experienced anything like it.\n\nIt's one of a kind,\n\nwell actually, it's eight or nine of a kind,\n\nand that's the only ones that exist.\n\nAnd it's all come from one guy's head.\n\nAnd he was told so many times that he couldn't make it\n\nand his team couldn't make it.\n\nAnd every time they fixed one problem,\n\neveryone else told them,\n\nNo, you can't do it, you can't do it.\n\nThey end up with a machine\n\nthat the super wealthy are clamoring to get their hands on.\n\nThey're buying it before they can even try it.\n\nAnd he's selling them at $250,000 a pop.\n\nIt's a hell of an achievement.\n\nBut above all, it's realizing this vision that he had\n\nfor this sort of Baja truck on the water,\n\npatented up to the eyeballs, it's a real amazing thing.\n\nNow we need to start introducing some sort\n\nof desirability index into the Wired Desired.\n\nAnd this is incredibly desirable.\n\nYou know, it's right up there.\n\nEight maybe? You know, like, you probably don't want it,\n\nif you haven't got loads of money, it's expensive.\n\nAnd also if you don't live on the water\n\nlike they do here down in Florida.\n\nBut if you do have these circumstances, my God.\n\nIn fact, I'm gonna have to have one last go.\n\n[dramatic classical music]",

Okay, great,\n\nwell, I'm excited about our next guest\n\nin the big interview, Mira Murati.\n\nShe recently, most recently served\n\nas Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI,\n\nwhere among other things,\n\nshe oversaw product teams building ChatGPT, DALL\u00b7E, Sora,\n\nand contributed to advancements in ai safety, ethics,\n\nand machine learning research.\n\nFor a few days, she was even the interim CEO, I here.\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nShe also handled the external relationships.\n\nAnd I could tell you, I did a story on Microsoft recently\n\nand unprompted,\n\nany number of people told me how important she was\n\nto the partnership\n\nand how they enjoyed working with her\n\nand how she made things go better for\n\nthat little company in the Northwest.\n\nPrior to joining opening OpenAI, she managed the product\n\nand engineering teams at Leap Motion\n\nand led the design, development\n\nand launch of vehicle products at Tesla,\n\nincluding the Model X.\n\nIs that all correct?\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, welcome to Mira.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\n[audience clapping]\n\nOkay, Mira, in September,\n\nyou left OpenAI with a very generous and diplomatic note.\n\nYou say you were going to do your own exploration.\n\nNow I've been reading unconfirmed reports\n\nthat you've been fundraising\n\nand you might be working\n\nwith some other people from OpenAI.\n\nNow, here's a spoiler alert.\n\nI know from our prep you're not gonna be talking a lot about\n\nwhat you're doing in terms of that,\n\nbut what can you tell us?\n\nCan you tell us anything about what you're up to next?\n\nI'm not going to share much about what I'm doing next\n\nbecause I am figuring out what that looks like.\n\nI'm in the midst of it,\n\nbut I can tell you a bit about what I'm excited\n\n[Steven] Okay.\n\nIn the future.\n\n[Steven] Sure.\n\nAnd yeah, generally I would totally ignore the noise\n\nand the speculation externally.\n\nI think actually there is just too much noise\n\nand obsession about who is leaving the labs and so on\n\nand let's focus on the actual substance of things.\n\nBut what I'm excited about is, you know, quite similar\n\nto the set of things that I was working on earlier,\n\nbut perhaps from a slightly different angle.\n\nI think I'm very optimistic about the future.\n\nI think we are about to see immense potential\n\nwith abundance of energy and intelligence\n\nand even meaning.\n\nAnd I really think that we're sort of at this beginning\n\nof infinite age of curiosity and wonder\n\nand deepening our knowledge about the world.\n\nAnd the hardest part is gonna be figuring out\n\nhow our civilization co-evolve with the development\n\nof science and technology as our knowledge deepens.\n\nAnd I hope that I can continue\n\nto contribute positively in that direction.\n\nSo your optimism,\n\nI think is something I saw not only with you,\n\nbut other folks at OpenAI.\n\nIt was a company that where people had a shared vision,\n\nI think you might even referred to it\n\nas something spiritual at one point.\n\nAnd it was centered about belief that, you know,\n\nhumanity really was on this quest to take, you know,\n\nwhat was suddenly possible to do\n\nand developing digital technology\n\nto do human like and beyond performance\n\nand things, you know, something called AGI,\n\nwhat some people called it.\n\nAnd that was within our grasp.\n\nYou did share that view\n\nand I guess do share\n\nthat we're approaching the point\n\nwhere we can accomplish that, is that correct?\n\nYeah, but, you know,\n\njust to kind of state the assumptions\n\nof what it actually means,\n\nI'll define AGI as sort of,\n\nyou know, a system that is capable\n\nof learning how to perform at human level\n\nacross all cognitive tasks.\n\nAnd you know, if you look at sort\n\nof the past few years this year,\n\nwe have systems that are capable\n\nof PhD level performance.\n\n[Steven] Yeah.\n\nIn many different domains\n\nand before that we had college level performance.\n\nAnd before that, just a couple of years\n\nbefore that we had high school level performance.\n\nSo if you just look at this trend\n\nand extrapolate it out, you know,\n\nit's not for certain,\n\nbut it shows that progress will likely continue.\n\nAnd it's not unreasonable\n\nthat in a very short time we could get to a system\n\nthat has a capability to learn how to perform at human level\n\nacross this basically all cognitive tasks.\n\nAnd right now this feels, I would say,\n\nquite achievable, even if it doesn't take, you know,\n\neven if it's not something that happens within a couple\n\nof years, it'll take perhaps a decade,\n\nmaybe two, I don't know,\n\nbut it feels achievable.\n\nWhereas I'd say, you know, even six years ago,\n\nto me it felt more sci-fi.\n\nAnd even though I was inspired\n\nand we believed in this, what you call spiritual mission\n\nand common vision,\n\nit felt quite sci-fi at the time.\n\nWhereas now we've made enough progress that we can kind\n\nof see how the technology evolves.\n\nWhen did you first begin to understand\n\nthat this was possible?\n\nHow did you, you know,\n\nbecome involved in working with AI?\n\nWas it at Tesla earlier in your education?\n\nYeah, so sort of by background,\n\nI was very drawn to math and sciences early on,\n\nand I went on to study mechanical engineering,\n\nworked in aerospace as an engineering,\n\nand kind of got a sense of how to build\n\nand develop complex systems\n\nin the world given real constraints and, you know,\n\nsystems that are safety critical.\n\nBut it was a Tesla where I got intuitive feel\n\nfor how AI would really advanced transportation.\n\nAnd there I started to think more about\n\nhow it would affect other domains\n\nand particularly how it would change our relationship\n\nto knowledge and information.\n\nAnd this is when I got interested\n\nin exploring virtual reality, augmented reality,\n\nand from the lens\n\nof exploring the human-machine interface.\n\nAnd while I was doing that, I was actually reading\n\nquite a bit of Vernor Vinge,\n\nand it was his essay on Singularity where he talks about,\n\nyou know, this is sort of likens our era\n\nto a time where, where the change is so transformational\n\nand it's quite similar to the rise\n\nof human life on earth.\n\n[Steven] Right.\n\nAnd it felt quite sci-fi,\n\nbut at the same time, it was enough,\n\nit was grounded enough on real possibility.\n\nAnd to me it felt like even if there was, you know,\n\n2% chance of this being possible,\n\nit would be the most important thing that I would do.\n\nAnd OpenAI mission really resonated with me to,\n\nyou know, ensure that AGI would benefit humanity.\n\nYou know, you mentioned, you know, the VR company you work\n\nfor, it seems, you know, like an interesting\n\non your resume, like almost like a side trip there.\n\nI mean, if this interview were taking place\n\nor if this conference were taking place like six years ago,\n\nall people would be talking about was the metaverse, right,\n\nand I don't think any\n\nof the sessions here are about the metaverse, you know,\n\nwe're, we're talking about AI.\n\nIs this something you still believe in?\n\nYou know, that, you know, AR and VR\n\nwill be super important technologies?\n\nYeah, my approach to VR\n\nand AR wasn't so much from a perspective\n\nthat I thought it would happen in that particular time.\n\nI was more curious\n\nto understand this next human-machine interface\n\nand what that could look like.\n\nI think virtual reality\n\nand augmented reality are have definitely advanced a lot,\n\nsince then.\n\nAnd yeah, I think we will definitely see great technologies,\n\nbut we will also see other interfaces.\n\nYou know, in talking about hype, some people feel\n\nthat AI has been crazily hyped\n\nand they're somehow saying that at this moment, you know,\n\nit shows that, oh, it's slowing down,\n\nit's plateauing is what they're saying.\n\nAnd they're saying\n\nthat the next generation models\n\nare not going to be the kind of leap we saw\n\nfrom like, the generation of GPT-3 to GPT-4,\n\nwhich was, you know, kind of like an astounding leap.\n\nDo you push back against that?\n\nDo you think AI is plateauing?\n\nSo I think one interesting observation is that people get,\n\nthey adapt very quickly to these changes.\n\nLike, you know, the ChatGPT and Claude\n\nand all the systems that we have today\n\nthat maybe they think they're not good enough,\n\nthey're not proving fast enough.\n\nSo I'll make that observation\n\nand maybe that is good signal for what's about\n\nto come in our society's ability to adapt to more change.\n\nBut in terms of whether there is a plateau\n\nor not, let's consider where the progress came from.\n\nAnd a lot of the progress today has come from, you know,\n\nincreasing the size of the neural networks,\n\nincreasing the amount of data, increasing the amount\n\nof compute that goes into the systems.\n\nAnd we've observed this scaling law,\n\nwhich is not literally a law,\n\nbut an observation rather,\n\nthat as you increase all of these things predictably leads\n\nit to increased capability.\n\nAnd in 2020 we saw this with text,\n\nbut since then we've seen it with a lot\n\nof different data code and images and video and so on.\n\nSo we've seen a lot of advancement coming from that.\n\nAnd then another vector has been of progress\n\nhas been multimodality.\n\nAnd there is also, you know,\n\nwe're just starting to see the rise of more agentic systems.\n\nSo I expect there is going to be a lot of progress there.\n\nBut then the question is, will this progress,\n\nwill this scaling laws lead us to systems\n\nthat are capable of performing a human level\n\nacross all cognitive tasks?\n\nI would say that, you know,\n\ncurrent evidence shows that the progress\n\nwill likely continue.\n\nAnd I don't think there is a lot of evidence\n\nto the contrary,\n\nbut whether we need, you know, new ideas to get\n\nto AGI level systems or not, that that's uncertain.\n\nAnd also it's very possible\n\nthat we hit limitations in architectures\n\nor, you know, other methods.\n\nBut then when that happens,\n\nit turns out that--\n\n[Steven] Yeah,\n\nPeople will find a way around it\n\nand there'll be new techniques,\n\nand new optimizations.\n\nSo I would say it's uncertain,\n\nbut I, I'm quite optimistic that the progress will continue.\n\nThere are also, I'd say, yeah, the counter arguments\n\nthat I've heard are, you know, the data wall\n\nand sort of the compute investment.\n\nAnd on the data wall,\n\npeople are exploring things like synthetic data\n\nwhere models generate their own data.\n\nAnd on compute, if we look at the level\n\nof investment on compute, you know,\n\nthis year companies are spending a billion dollars\n\nand next year that goes up by a factor of 10 to 10 billion\n\nand the year after that to a hundred billion.\n\nSo from capability perspective,\n\nit seems like progress will continue.\n\nBut I think getting\n\nto AGI level systems is not just about capability\n\nand it's also about figuring out\n\nhow we make the systems aligned, safe.\n\nIt's about figuring out the entire social infrastructure\n\nin which these systems are going to be operated in.\n\n[Steven] Right,\n\nSo that we can have a positive future\n\nbecause this technology is not intrinsically good or bad,\n\nit comes with both sides.\n\nSo you mentioned safety.\n\nYou know, I have to say when I was diving\n\ninto OpenAI, you know,\n\nwhich was founded to build AGI safely,\n\nthe people I talked to in general,\n\nI'm not talking about you necessarily.\n\nthey got more excited about the building AGI part\n\nthan the safety part.\n\nNot that they dismissed it,\n\nbut that's what really got their motor running.\n\nYou know, they'd light up\n\nwhen they talk about about that.\n\nDo you feel that we're spending enough attention\n\nto the safety and, you know,\n\nbecause there's kind of an arm race going on,\n\nlike kind of, there's literally, you know,\n\na race to best, you know,\n\nthis company the best than another,\n\nyour model's better than my model, you know.\n\nI've gotta fix that and race ahead.\n\nDo you think we're overrunning safety,\n\nyou think we're paying enough attention?\n\nI think that on practical safety,\n\nwe've actually made a lot of progress.\n\nThe work that OpenAI has done\n\non practical alignment has been incredible\n\nand it has really led the industry.\n\nAnd that's been very interesting to see\n\nbecause it is also,\n\nI think kind of like the market dynamics have pushed\n\neveryone in the industry to really innovate in that vector.\n\nBut there is a lot of work\n\non more theoretical alignment\n\nand that I think we're lacking,\n\nbut not only also sort of unlike governance.\n\nWhat what does it mean to live in a world\n\nwith this AGI level systems?\n\nAnd also I think regulation is lagging\n\nbehind basically the entire infrastructure.\n\nI would say that civilization needs to coexist harmoniously\n\nwith this technology\n\nis really lagging behind\n\nWhat worries you more,\n\nthe sort of problems we might have\n\nand we're actually seeing with misinformation\n\nor, you know, bias,\n\nyou know, and things like that.\n\nOr the, you know,\n\nlonger term as existential kind of threats\n\nthat people paint AI have.\n\nSome people have said that the as existential threats\n\nare brought up as sort of\n\nlike a distraction\n\nbecause people aren't really building the safety stuff now,\n\nyou know, which worries you more?\n\nI'd say both, but more perhaps on the longer\n\nterm safety questions,\n\nbecause I think that there is\n\nmarket alignment on the short term safety questions\n\naround misinformation and bias\n\nbecause, you know, it's not good for business\n\nto have AI systems integrated in your business\n\nthat are making things up.\n\nAnd so I think a lot of effort will actually is already\n\nand will continue to go into this set of problems.\n\nBut one area that's lacking that's more near term\n\nis sort of the transparency and the AI literacy.\n\nA lot of people, a majority\n\nof the world doesn't have a good understanding\n\nof what's going on.\n\nThese systems are black boxes.\n\nAnd I think investing more\n\nin the understanding of what these systems are capable of,\n\nhow they work, how we control them,\n\ninvesting more in the direction,\n\ngiving people an intuition for, you know,\n\nwhere they have control and where they don't\n\nand also what what we expect in the future.\n\nI think those things are very important.\n\nOkay, can you explain to me,\n\nyou've been working on these products\n\nwhy we haven't been able to get rid of the Hallucinations?\n\nSo one way to think about it is,\n\nyeah, actually Von Neumann wrote an essay in 1955\n\nwhere he talks about sort of the harmful\n\nand positive aspects of a technology\n\nand how they're always tied together.\n\n[Steven] Yeah.\n\nAnd he says, you know, I will just paraphrase\n\nsomething like, These things are always tied together\n\nand you almost cannot distinguish,\n\nit's impossible to distinguish the lion from the lamb.\n\nAnd I think hallucinations are like that where it gives you,\n\nyou know, this ability for the model\n\nto provide very imaginative outputs,\n\nbut at the same time in a different context\n\nthat can be quite damaging\n\nand harmful if you're operating in a context\n\nwhere you need very accurate information in, you know,\n\nlegal context or medicine or so on.\n\nAnd, you know, since the development\n\nand deployment of the LMS in the real world,\n\nwe've developed new techniques like using tools,\n\nusing search, getting citation and so on.\n\nBut it's still something that we need to figure out.\n\nYou know, that brings up\n\nsort of an interesting question.\n\nI know, you know, OpenAI is struggling, indeed,\n\nit's being sued for, you know, IP,\n\nthe allegedly and the training sets.\n\nSome people have suggested, you know, you talked earlier\n\nof synthetic like data\n\nthat that could be one way to get around that.\n\nBut it seems to me that the more we go down this path,\n\nthe more valuable, the trustworthy information is,\n\nyou know, like made by humans.\n\nThere was a study I read about recently\n\nthat talked about that if models are trained on, you know,\n\ndata which is produced by AI, it sort of, you know,\n\ngets awful results\n\nand you know, in each iteration it kind of goes\n\nto meaninglessness, right,\n\nwhich seems to put a premium on like human created\n\ncontent to put it in the training sets.\n\nSo inevitably what happens?\n\nYou know, it winds up to be some sort of licensing things\n\nfor the best, most trustworthy models,\n\nwhich then sort of, I guess limits its world models.\n\nHow are we going to eventually deal with this IP issue\n\nand have reliable, world knowledgeable models?\n\nYeah, I think that's probably the answer to that is\n\nprobably very nuance.\n\nThere is the aspect of, you know, how the laws evolve\n\nwith the dawn of this technology\n\nand there's a question of that.\n\nThere is another question of how do you make sure\n\nthat the people that have contributed data\n\nalong the way are, are part of, you know,\n\nsomehow are--\n\nYeah.\n\nTaking part into benefits\n\nand figuring out and innovating perhaps in business models\n\nand understanding, doing more research\n\nand understanding how specific data contribution\n\nleads to the model providing, you know,\n\na certain amount of revenue.\n\nAnd another layer is definitely the research on the data\n\nand figuring out what kind of data you can use\n\nand pushing areas like post training more,\n\nwhich is, you know, you're using techniques\n\nlike our reinforcement learning with human feedback\n\nor you're doing reinforcement learning from AI feedback,\n\nlike the constitutional AI stuff,\n\nor you're using other techniques.\n\nBut I think this is one area actually\n\nthat is getting more and more sophisticated\n\nin the modern AI systems\n\nand requires a lot of human feedback or synthetic data.\n\nYou know, finally,\n\nI guess what happens if we do get AGI?\n\nYour former boss says is gonna be an age\n\nof unbelievable abundance.\n\nYou know, the poorest person in the future will be,\n\nwell better off than the richest people now.\n\nYou must have given us a lot of thought.\n\nWhere are we gonna be if we get this AGI,\n\nwhich can match and exceed some human capabilities\n\nand then learn to go beyond us,\n\nwhat's that world look like?\n\nI think that depends on us.\n\nWe have a lot of agency\n\nfor how things are about to evolve\n\nand how civilization co-evolves with this technology.\n\nI think it's entirely up to us, the institutions,\n\nthe structures we put into place, the level of investment,\n\nthe work that we do,\n\nand really how we move forward the entire ecosystem.\n\nI think right now there is a lot of focus\n\non specific individuals,\n\nbut the real question there is\n\nhow do all of us contribute\n\nto this ecosystem to move it forward in a way\n\nthat's collectively positive\n\nand that is really what will shape the actions\n\nand constrain the actions of any specific individuals.\n\nAnd I hope that more people focus on that,\n\nthis is not going to be up to a single company\n\nor individual to bring AGI to the entire civilization.\n\nWell thank you very much, this is great.\n\nThank you.\n\n[audience clapping]",

Hi, Jensen.\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nHey Lauren. I wish I was there.\n\nI wish you were here too,\n\nbecause it's really hard to get the,\n\nit's hard to get the vibes of that\n\nleather jacket over Zoom.\n\nI could do it.\n\n[Lauren laughs]\n\nAlright, Jensen, you are joining us today from Thailand,\n\nand I know that you've been on\n\na bit of a world tour recently,\n\ntalking about Sovereign AI,\n\nwhich is I think what you're doing in Thailand, correct?\n\nTell us about this.\n\nWell, first of all, it's great to be with you.\n\nI'm here in Bangkok.\n\nIn fact, it's really great to be back here,\n\nbecause you probably don't know this,\n\nbut I lived here for about five years when I was a child,\n\nand from about, from about five or so.\n\nAnd I went to school,\n\nan international school here.\n\nIt was called Rudi Internationals.\n\nIt's a couple of blocks away.\n\nAnd so, it's really, it's really terrific to be here.\n\nJensen, I'll also note you're the only guest\n\nwho's technically joining us from the future,\n\nbecause it's already December 4th there.\n\n[Lauren and the audience laugh]\n\nI think this is very fitting.\n\nIt it is. It is.\n\nAnd I could, I could provide some insight\n\nand some, you know, some warnings,\n\nand keep you out harm's way.\n\nExcellent. We need that.\n\nOkay, so tell us about this.\n\nTell us about Sovereign AI.\n\nYeah, so what's going on is,\n\nis countries are awakened to\n\nthe incredible capabilities of AI,\n\nand the importance of AI for their own nations.\n\nThey realize that their data\n\nis part of their natural resource.\n\nTheir data, of course, encodes their,\n\ntheir society's knowledge and culture,\n\nand common sense, and, you know,\n\ntheir hopes and dreams.\n\nAnd, they now realize that they really\n\nshould take a role in processing that data,\n\nharvesting that data,\n\nand refining it into intelligence,\n\nand providing their native intelligence to their society.\n\nAnd so that's one observation.\n\nThe other observation is that,\n\nthat people are starting to realize\n\nthat AI in a lot of ways is like\n\nthe energy infrastructure,\n\nthe communications infrastructure,\n\nand now there's going to be an intelligence,\n\na digital intelligence infrastructure.\n\nAnd these AI factories,\n\nthese data centers are part of that\n\ninfrastructure that they have to be mindful about,\n\nand play a role in forming.\n\nAnd this infrastructure is necessary for,\n\nof course, their industry,\n\nbut it's also really important for their society,\n\nand for their education, for their colleges,\n\nfor research and startups and so on and so forth.\n\nAnd so I'm here in Thailand to celebrate\n\nthe partners that we have here.\n\nWe have an AI cloud company here\n\ncalled SIAM AI that is starting.\n\nWe have some 56 or so AI startups\n\nthat I'm gonna be meeting,\n\nI'll be meeting today,\n\na whole bunch of Professors- Just today, 56?\n\nYeah. Is there like a Jensen AI\n\nthat you deployed?\n\nI mean, how do you fit those, how do you,\n\nliterally, how do you fit that many meetings in?\n\nLauren, you just gotta go fast, you know.\n\n[audience laughs] You just do things fast.\n\n[Lauren laughs] It's like our computers,\n\nyou gotta do things fast.\n\nAnd so they're professors that I'm meeting,\n\nthere are companies that I'm meeting,\n\nand of course had the benefit\n\nof meeting the prime minister,\n\nand she's really, really impressive.\n\nAnd she's 38 years old, and leading our,\n\nleading this country.\n\nAnd really believes in technology,\n\nand wants the country to lean forward in AI.\n\nAnd so it's really terrific to be here.\n\nThe way that you're,\n\nthe way that you're describing this is,\n\nI mean, I'm sure it's nice if you\n\nget to sell more GPUs as well, but\n\nit also sounds like you're, you know,\n\nreclassifying this era of generative AI as infrastructure.\n\nAnd I'm wondering what that means\n\nfor the development of AI models.\n\nWell, let's see.\n\nThere are a couple of questions in there.\n\nFirst of all, it is infrastructure in the sense that,\n\nthat so many different parts of society needs it.\n\nYou know, universities need it, researchers need it,\n\nstartup companies need it, large companies need it.\n\nAnd, and so when every aspect\n\nof a society needs something,\n\nit's generally recognized as infrastructure.\n\nAnd I think that artificial intelligence\n\nwill be a layer above the internet,\n\na layer above, above the way\n\nwe interact with computers today.\n\nAnd, and your question about large language model\n\nis it's essentially the new operating system,\n\nyou know, whereas the way that we used to use computers\n\nis to program it and retrieve files,\n\nand manage files, and so on, so forth in the past,\n\nin the future, the way we'll use computers,\n\nof course, is to, to prompt it,\n\nto ask it a question,\n\nto ask it to do something for us.\n\nAnd at the core of that,\n\ninstead of the operating systems of the past,\n\nthe core of that is now large language models.\n\nIt's not one large language model,\n\nbut it's a system of large language models.\n\nAnd, but at the core of it is the large language model.\n\nYour question about, about large language models here\n\nand around the world...\n\nFor example, I was, I was in Denmark,\n\nand they're building,\n\nthey're building the large language model of Denmark.\n\nAnd I was in Sweden,\n\nand they're building the large language model of Sweden.\n\nAnd I was in Japan,\n\nthey're building the large language model of Japan.\n\nAnd of course Indonesia is building it.\n\nIndia is building several.\n\nAnd here in Thailand,\n\nit's called ThaiGPT.\n\nAnd so, there are these language models\n\nthat are, that are being created.\n\nI think the availability of understanding\n\nof how to build these large language models\n\nis fairly well documented,\n\nand the systems are available,\n\nand people are doing a really good job.\n\nPeople are also realizing that,\n\nthat it's not one giant model that needs to be built,\n\nbut in a lot of ways,\n\nyou could create very effective AIs\n\nthat are systems of large language models,\n\nAnd the systems of large language models.\n\nof course, some of it's related to reasoning,\n\nsome of it is related to tool use,\n\nsome of it's related to retrieval of information,\n\nand guard railing, and you know,\n\nthe synthetic data generation\n\nfor reward models and reflection models,\n\nand, you know, all kinds of different,\n\ndifferent types of models are involved in a,\n\nin a system of AIs,\n\nand the knowledge of how to do that,\n\nand the frameworks and tools\n\nof how to do that that is widely available.\n\nAnd so I think every country should be able to do it.\n\nFascinating. One of the things\n\nthat you've been talking about lately,\n\nand I think it's it's broadly\n\nkind of a buzzword right now in AI, is agents.\n\nYou spoke about this a little,\n\na little bit on your most recent earnings call too.\n\nI think this is probably one of those things\n\nwhere people are like maybe even\n\nsaying it in conversation and not fully sure what it means.\n\nSo like, what is an AI agent to you?\n\nWhat does it, what does it do?\n\nAnd why are some folks saying that this is the next,\n\nthis is the next wave of generative AI?\n\nSimple. So the first, the first,\n\nthe first wave was the development of-\n\n[Lauren] And you don't have to go back to like\n\n1993 by the way.\n\nWe're on a, we're on a timeframe here.\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nOkay. Alright. Alright.\n\nOkay, 2012. The first wave started around-\n\n[indistinct] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd that first wave was perception AI, right?\n\nRemember all of a sudden we,\n\nwe were good at computer vision,\n\nand speed recognition,\n\nand all kinds of perception related models.\n\nThe second generation with generative AI,\n\nand that was really about three,\n\nfour or five years ago,\n\nof course, GANs were the beginning of that,\n\nGPT is an example of that,\n\ndiffusion models, so on and so forth.\n\nGenerative AI. Now agentic AI,\n\nwhich is where we are today,\n\nis really the combination of all that.\n\nAnd it's really the fundamentals of intelligence,\n\nwhich is perception, reasoning and planning.\n\nAnd if you could say, if I replace planning with,\n\nwith generation, perception, of course, perception AI.\n\nSo really what's missing is the ability to do reasoning.\n\nAnd we now have models that are,\n\nare doing a better job with reasoning.\n\nYou could give it a basic mission,\n\nand break it down to step-by-steps.\n\nIt could be a chain of thoughts,\n\nit could be a chain of trees,\n\nit could be all kinds of different ways\n\nof coming up with a reason through a problem.\n\nMaybe even inviting other,\n\ninviting other Ais to help you do a job.\n\nFor example, an AI that could be good\n\nat generating images,\n\nor good at generating music,\n\nor retrieving a file, you know,\n\ngenerating citations, doing search,\n\nso on and so forth so that you could,\n\nyou now have a system of AI's\n\nthat together are essentially agentic,\n\nor otherwise robotic, or otherwise intelligent.\n\nAnd so I think those words are somewhat interchangeable,\n\ndepending on their context.\n\nBut basically it's really about\n\nperception, reasoning and planning.\n\nAnd the idea too is that we're shifting from this world\n\nwhere we used computers to do work,\n\nbut now the computers are doing the work for us.\n\nYou could use an agent to perform a task\n\nfor you on your computer, right?\n\nThus freeing up time.\n\nAre you personally using AI agents\n\nin that way right now?\n\nLike, could you describe an example?\n\nI use AI, I use several AIs,\n\nand I use 'em all just because I enjoy them all.\n\nI use Gemini, I use ChatGPT.\n\nBut is it actually doing your work\n\nfor you at this stage?\n\nI use it to write a lot.\n\nI give it a, I give it a basic outline,\n\ngive it some PDFs of my previous talks.\n\nAnd I give it, get it to write my first draft.\n\nIt's really fantastic.\n\nSo, so anytime I write you an email,\n\nand you actually respond, that's an agent,\n\nyou're saying, Jensen? [audience laughs]\n\nNo. Well, I have a filter,\n\nso when Lauren writes me, I write back.\n\nIt goes right to the top.\n\nGoes right to the top. Alright.\n\nLet's talk about the future of NVIDIA's business.\n\nYou have a lot of partners around the world\n\nas you're describing,\n\nand I'm wondering how vulnerable, if at all,\n\nyou're feeling to political instability right now?\n\nHow are you thinking about this?\n\nWell, the world is changing.\n\nThe world is changing, but, and, but,\n\nbut also simultaneously,\n\nthe fundamental technology trends are so incredible.\n\nAnd so in our, in our industry, in our business,\n\nthis fundamental trend of artificial intelligence,\n\nthis new layer of computing,\n\nthis reinvention of the computer,\n\na reset of computing as we know it\n\nover the last 60 years,\n\nis just an extraordinary opportunity.\n\nAnd the type of problems we're able to solve now,\n\nthe type of, the type of products and solutions,\n\nand capabilities we can offer to the world\n\nis just extraordinary.\n\nAnd I think that's one of the reasons why\n\nartificial intelligence is so central\n\nto your conference today.\n\nAnd so I think we all recognize that.\n\nThat's probably, that fundamental force,\n\nthat dynamic, that tailwind, if you will,\n\nis just so incredibly strong,\n\nthat the technology industry\n\nand all of the software industries that sit on top of it,\n\nand all the industries that sit on top of that,\n\nare gonna go through some extraordinary\n\ntransformations over the next decade.\n\nHmm. To specifically drill down to politics, though,\n\nI'm thinking about something like,\n\nfor example, this Monday,\n\nthe US Department of Commerce\n\njust expanded its export controls.\n\nAnd that's something that has\n\nthe potential to affect NVIDIA's business\n\nbecause the export controls apply\n\nnot just to semiconductors,\n\nbut also to more broadly, more componentry,\n\nand that goes into your GPUs.\n\nSo, you know, when you look at something like that,\n\ndo you think the export controls are,\n\nthe reasons for them are justified?\n\nHow concerned are you about China, for example,\n\nyou know, rising up in AI,\n\nand the competition that China poses?\n\nYeah, several questions there.\n\nI think first of all, our job is to,\n\nto do our best to inform, to address,\n\nand make aware the dynamics of our industry,\n\nand how it works,\n\nand how our company works in\n\nvarious markets around the world,\n\ndo our best to explain those things to the administration.\n\nAnd it's up to them to come up\n\nwith the best po possible policies.\n\nAnd then after that, our job is,\n\nis to continue to do our best to innovate,\n\nand drive our technology forward,\n\nsupport our customers, and continue to be successful.\n\nAnd so, so, you know,\n\nthose are things within our control,\n\nand I think that our interactions\n\nwith the administration has been great.\n\nIn terms of the incoming administration,\n\npresident-elect, why are you guys laughing?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said\n\nin the recent past that he believes that\n\nTaiwan has taken some of the chip business from us.\n\nYou work very closely with Partner TSMC based in Taiwan.\n\nWhen you hear remarks like that, I mean,\n\nhow concerned are you about what that\n\ncould mean for your relationship with TSMC?\n\nWell, TSMC, TSMC's role in the industry,\n\nand role in the world is fairly unquestionable.\n\nI I think they're,\n\nthey're obviously a very important technology innovator,\n\na very critical part of the world's supply chain,\n\nan extraordinary company with excellent leadership,\n\nand a culture that that was really built by hand\n\nover the course of some 40 years,\n\nand a relationship and a partnership\n\nthat is really critical to us.\n\nAnd not just to us,\n\nto companies that that everybody knows all over the world.\n\nI think all of that is gonna remain true.\n\nAnd if anything, you know,\n\nTSMC as a company gets better and better\n\nevery single year that we work with 'em.\n\nAnd, and so, so our relationship\n\nwith TSMC is gonna continue,\n\nand our, the world's dependency on TSMC\n\nis going to continue for quite a long time to come.\n\nHave you spoken yet with\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump since the election?\n\nI've reached out to President Trump\n\nand congratulated him, and wished him success,\n\nand told him that we'll do everything we can\n\nto help the administration succeed.\n\nOkay. Do you anticipate having\n\nextended conversations about your business with him?\n\nWell, artificial intelligence is\n\nobviously really important.\n\n[Lauren] Huge topic. And yeah, huge topic.\n\nAnd it's important on a whole bunch of dimensions.\n\nOne dimension, just tech technological reasons\n\nwhy it's important,\n\nbut it's also important because it's a brand new industry.\n\nThis is an industry that's never existed before.\n\nYou know, we're producing intelligence, and manufacturing,\n\nmanufacturing intelligence at scale for the very first time.\n\nAnd the reason why I chose that word,\n\nmanufacturing is, is because it, usually,\n\nan industry is formed,\n\nwhen it manufactures something that didn't exist before.\n\nAnd so, for example,\n\nmy generation was responsible for the,\n\nfor the manufacturing at scale of software.\n\nBefore my generation, there was no such thing as software.\n\nAnd then after this generation of technologists,\n\nand all of us working in the computer industry,\n\nthere's now a concept called software\n\nthat you could manufacture.\n\nThere's common sense about manufacturing at best practices\n\nand all the technology necessary manufacture software.\n\nAnd, and we do it at an incredible scale,\n\nand a it's multi-trillion dollar industry.\n\nWell, we have a brand new industry now,\n\nand this industry is not about producing software,\n\nit's about producing intelligence.\n\nAnd this industry requires energy,\n\nand requires a lot of factories,\n\nand has great implications to\n\ngreat social impact, industrial impact,\n\nand the economic and technological success of a country.\n\nAnd so I'm certain that\n\nthe new administration and President Trump\n\nwould be quite interested in this industry,\n\nand I'll be more than delighted to provide any support,\n\nand answer any questions that I can.\n\nThere's also been a lot of excitement about Blackwell,\n\nwhich is your newest chip.\n\nIt is being delivered right now, right?\n\nYou've delivered it to some of the hyperscalers, correct.\n\nBlackwell is a, is a whole system.\n\nYes. A bunch of switches,\n\nand networking, and computing, and so and so forth,\n\nand a whole mountain of software,\n\nand it is in full production,\n\nit's going quite well.\n\nAnd we have Blackwell systems\n\ninstalled all over the world now.\n\nAnd what would you say is the,\n\nlike the number one biggest difference\n\nfrom Blackwell that your customers are going to see?\n\nI mean, it's assumed that it's faster,\n\nbut what are the, what are the downstream effects of that?\n\nThere are several things.\n\nFirst, because in training,\n\nbecause of its performance is so incredible,\n\nit's a leap in performance.\n\nAnother way of thinking about that,\n\nis instead of waiting months\n\nto process the data necessary to train a model\n\nand then train a model,\n\nyou could reduce that time,\n\nyou know, by, by three x, by four x.\n\nAnd so it could have been six months,\n\nand now it's month and a half.\n\nAnd with everybody racing to the\n\nnext plateau of AI capability,\n\nthe difference between three months\n\nfrom one company to another company could be a game changer.\n\nAnd so everybody is really racing\n\nto reach that next level.\n\nIn inference, this is one of the extraordinary things\n\nthat we've done with Blackwell.\n\nBecause we realize that inference is not\n\ngoing to be just zero shot or one shot,\n\nbut inference is going to be,\n\nit's gonna include long thinking.\n\nAnd it's a, it's gonna be essentially\n\nan AI coming up with all kinds\n\nof different scenarios in its mind.\n\nAnd then of course,\n\nwith more compute, offer a better answer,\n\nwhich is a new way of scaling.\n\nWe call it test time scaling,\n\nor inference time scaling.\n\nAnd so because of that,\n\nwe invented new technologies so that,\n\nso that inference can continue to be super fast,\n\nsuper energy efficient.\n\nIt's like 30 times more energy efficient than,\n\nand faster than previous inference capabilities.\n\nSo all these capabilities are now possible.\n\nJensen, we have less than five minutes left,\n\nand I wish we could cover a million more topics,\n\nbut I wanna ask you about the future of Nvidia.\n\n[Jensen] I got all day.\n\nYou have, do you? [audience laughs]\n\n[Jensen] Yeah. You really are dispatching\n\nyour AI to take those 56 meetings.\n\nI'm still gonna, I'm gonna think about that\n\nfor a long time, 56 meetings in a day.\n\nYou've had this incredible run.\n\nI mean, truly incredible run.\n\nNvidia is at the top.\n\nAnd I'm wondering how you think about maintaining that.\n\nAnd I think this was probably on\n\na lot of people's minds this week,\n\nas we saw that the, you know,\n\nthe CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger stepped down,\n\nand some reported he was forced out.\n\nAnd, you know, I don't think anyone would've\n\nthought of Intel, you know,\n\nin the same way 20 years ago.\n\nAnd so how do you ensure that NVIDIA\n\ndoesn't end up in the same boat 10, 20 years from now?\n\nWhat are the, what are the actual\n\nstrategic steps you're taking to ensure that?\n\nYeah, a really good question.\n\nFirst of all,\n\nI've worked with Pat for several decades,\n\nand really appreciated his friendship and partnership.\n\nAnd we've got all kinds of things\n\nthat we're working on with Intel.\n\nAnd we've selected their CPUs\n\nfor many of our programs that are upcoming.\n\nAnd this is a really important company.\n\nAnd, and they're still just,\n\nif I could put it out there,\n\njust the teams that we work with,\n\non their CPU side, on their PC side,\n\non the data center side are really extraordinary.\n\nAnd so we've got a lot of great friendships there,\n\nand I wish 'em well.\n\nAt the core, at the core,\n\nthis is the challenge when,\n\nwhen something fundamental happens to an industry,\n\nand that force is so incredible.\n\nAnd you have to keep remembering this,\n\nthat in fact, the central processing unit\n\nwas described in 1963, 1964.\n\nIt was literally called the central processing unit.\n\nAnd the IBM system 360,\n\nfairly clearly describes modern computing as we know it.\n\nAnd it lasted about 60 years.\n\nAnd so all of a sudden, not all of a sudden,\n\nbut over, because of deep learning,\n\nand because of the incredible pace of innovation\n\naround deep learning and machine learning,\n\nthe world went from coding,\n\nand coding instructions that ran on CPUs\n\nto machine learning of neural networks\n\nthat run on GPUs.\n\nThis force is so incredible.\n\nIt's not as if,\n\nit's not as if you can compete against this.\n\nYou're either, you're either in this force,\n\nyou're either on this wave,\n\nor you've missed that wave.\n\nBut no CPU could ever,\n\nno matter how good it is,\n\ncould overcome machine learning.\n\nThis is no different than,\n\nno disk drive can overcome\n\nthe power of cloud computing.\n\nYou just, you're not gonna build a better computer.\n\nBecause the fundamental trends and the benefits\n\nof cloud computing is so incredible.\n\nYou're not gonna overcome the trend of mobile computing.\n\nIt's just too fundamental, mobile cloud.\n\nAnd so, so machine learning is even more powerful than that.\n\nThe fundamental way that we do software has changed.\n\nAnd the result of that has fundamentally changed.\n\nInstead of creating tools, software tools,\n\nwe're now developing AIs.\n\nAnd, and so the way you build it,\n\nhow you process it,\n\nwhat you can build as a result of it\n\nhas all fundamentally changed.\n\nAnd this all happened in 10 years.\n\nSo you're either preparing for that 10 year trend,\n\nor you get caught off guard by that.\n\nAnd this is, this is, you know,\n\nbecause of, because of the success of CPUs\n\nin the last 60 years, it's not,\n\nit's not, it's probably not unexpected.\n\nAnd it's probably even understandable\n\nthat an organization that is so focused\n\non building CPUs and and its leadership\n\nin that area would be caught off guard.\n\nAnd so I think first of all,\n\nI think that that's really at the core of it.\n\nThey're, of course, a lot of other,\n\nother people could criticize their circumstance,\n\nbut I think foundationally it's really about\n\na seismic change in technology,\n\nand that the future of computing\n\nis gonna fundamentally change.\n\nAnd so how do you ensure that 30 years from now,\n\nwe're not saying that about GPUs,\n\nand NVIDIA's position?\n\nWell, there's no guarantee, Lauren.\n\nFirst of all, we just gotta put it out there,\n\nthere's no guarantee.\n\nI will say that because of the way\n\nthat NVIDIA was born and built by hand,\n\nthe company was really designed for agility.\n\nYou know, remember, this is a company\n\nthat started out with a fundamental\n\ntechnology architecture that two years\n\nafter we were founded, we completely changed.\n\nWe admitted the fact that recognized,\n\nand admitted the fact that the architecture that we had,\n\nthe technology we had was just, was just wrong.\n\nWe understood why we did it,\n\nbut it was fundamentally the wrong approach.\n\nAnd completely changed the company\n\nto go after a new way of doing computer graphics.\n\nWe also reinvented the company several times,\n\nas, you know, people know well,\n\ninventing Cuda, and then after that,\n\npursuing deep learning,\n\ngoing from a chip company to a systems company,\n\nsystems company to an infrastructure company.\n\nAnd so as we, as we make those, those changes,\n\nit's in response to wanting to realize\n\nour hopes and dreams of being an impactful company\n\nin an industry that we care so deeply about,\n\nthe computer industry.\n\nAnd so, so long as,\n\nso long as the computer industry\n\ncontinues to be important,\n\nand we continue to be agile,\n\nand be surrounded by amazing\n\ncomputer scientists and talent,\n\nwe'll continue to, you know,\n\nto shape shift ourselves,\n\nto be impactful in the future.\n\nAnd so that's my hope.\n\nWe'll see how it turns out.\n\nJensen, I can only speak for myself,\n\nbut I think I speak for others here when I say\n\nI can't wait to see what you come up with next,\n\nwhat your next pivot shift.\n\nI mean, you are in the future right now.\n\nSo. I am.\n\nYeah. And we really appreciate you\n\ntaking the time to be here. A couple of hours.\n\nYou are. Yeah.\n\nSo save us all, please.\n\nLauren, I gotta tell you, the future is bright.\n\n[audience laughs] Everything's fine.\n\nThe water's safe. That's Excellent. Thank you.\n\nI think your stock just went up as you said that.\n\nSo, thank you so much, Jensen.\n\nWe really appreciate it. Thank you, Lauren.\n\nThank you. [audience applauds]\n\nI wish I could be there with you.\n\nTake care. Have a great conference.\n\n[audience applause continues]",

[audience cheering]\n\nNice.\n\nI appreciate the woos.\n\nI appreciate the woos.\n\n[Zach] Where is that fire?\n\nIsn't this a fireside chat? Oh, we were having that.\n\nNo. Sorry.\n\nIt's just a little, just you and I.\n\nWe can make it intimate.\n\n[chuckles] Okay. Very good.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo you have a really specific vision, right?\n\nLike I feel like in your work, highly stylized,\n\nand I don't mean that as a criticism,\n\nbut how do you see...\n\nLet's start with, like, the big elephant in the room.\n\nHow do you see the advancing AI systems\n\nlike LLMs, visual models, influencing the industry?\n\nI know it's a broad question.\n\nNo, no, it's a cool question.\n\nBecause obviously it's an exciting time\n\nand obviously that technology, which is also\n\nstill slightly ambiguous about what exactly\n\nand how exactly it will land in entertainment.\n\nI think it's an exciting frontier\n\nand it's a cool thing to speculate about\n\nand have fun thinking about workflows and stuff.\n\nI've spent some time sort of thinking about\n\nlike, what a workflow and AI workflow might look like,\n\nMh-hm. You know?\n\nBut I do think it's a thing that...\n\nLike, for instance, I think, you know,\n\nwhen you have someone like myself or I think,\n\nyou know, anyone who's interested\n\nin making specific imagery, like very,\n\nvery specific imagery, I feel like that...\n\nWe're still evolving toward that, I think.\n\nWith AI, you know? Yeah.\n\nAnd so I've thought about it this way.\n\nLike, I think that in the not too distant future,\n\nI like to think about the AI, like\n\nthe potential for an AI interaction\n\nto be like, if the AI can create\n\na 3D world, like a game engine,\n\nbut like an instantaneous 3D world,\n\nwhich is not outrageous.\n\nNo, I think we're not far from that.\n\nNot far from that. Yeah.\n\nSo say I filmed you with my phone\n\nor some other capture device, or lidar\n\nor whatever, you're the actor,\n\nand you did your awesome performance\n\nand it was great, by the way.\n\nThank you so much. It was so good.\n\nAnd then we say we've got the performance now.\n\nOkay. And\n\nI can see a world where the production designer\n\nhas created all the sets and everything that we needed.\n\nThose have all been sort of loaded into an aesthetic bank.\n\nAnd that is to say that this bank...\n\nThe AI understands what the movie\n\naesthetic core will be, and that hopefully\n\nis a thing that I'm interested in, right?\n\nLike, Yeah.\n\nNow, like I like this kind of lensing,\n\nthis kind of moats of dust, this kind of backlight,\n\nthis kind of whatever, on and on.\n\nAnd also this kind of set design.\n\nIt's, for instance, we're doing our movie\n\nin France, so it's gonna be like a French landscape\n\nbut we're very specific about the French farmhouse,\n\nand this is the way it looks, and it's got\n\npatina walls and all that, we did it.\n\nOkay. So that exists.\n\nAnd I can imagine that now, when we make a shot,\n\nif that 3D world, if, if the AI understands,\n\nif I'm saying, Okay, I want the camera 10 feet away.\n\nI want it this high, you're by the window.\n\nSo you're lit by the window.\n\nI want the sun out the window.\n\nAnd if that can happen in real time,\n\nif that conversation could happen.\n\n'Cause like, you know, I converse with my-\n\nYou you were just conversing with your AI backstage.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I find that like...\n\n'Cause I think that also this idea of, like,\n\nright now, this sort of...\n\nThe prompting gatekeepers of AI have this.\n\nYou know, there is this kind of prompting\n\nwhat I would call, which is cool in a way\n\nbecause like AI is like, Oh, no,\n\nit's available to everyone unless\n\nyou don't know how to do it.\n\nYeah.\n\nThen you can't do it.\n\nSo it's like a cool, there's a cool thing.\n\nDo you see it enhancing your filmmaking,\n\nor do you see it replacing filmmaking?\n\nI think where I was going with this is that,\n\nso in this world where I'm making that shot of you.\n\nYeah. The question\n\nreally becomes, unless there's something\n\nabout this shot that requires it to be made\n\nonly on the computer, or only in an AI universe,\n\nthen I think you have to say,\n\nOkay, well what's the why of it then?\n\nRight. Like, what does that\n\nkeep me from flying to France?\n\nIs that all that I saved?\n\nI mean, if it's a handheld shot\n\nof you sitting in a chair by window,\n\nWhy would you use AI. Why would you use it?\n\nYeah. Other than you can,\n\nand a lot, look, there's not to say\n\nthat that's not a reason. Right.\n\nYou know, does it democratize in some way,\n\nthe ability to not have to travel to France,\n\nand if I'm just at home, a filmmaker at home,\n\nand I captured my actor friend,\n\nand I wanna make a movie in France,\n\ncan I just do it?\n\nMaybe. Yeah.\n\nSo I mean, I think there is a potential\n\nfor it making things accessible,\n\nbecause obviously that same AI doesn't care\n\nwhether the house is on fire, or whether\n\nit's on Mars or whether it's underwater.\n\nThat's all the same conversation.\n\nSo all the things that might cost\n\na lot of money about what I just described\n\nare to the AI no different.\n\nRight. But to you as a filmmaker,\n\nis it gonna be different?\n\nLike, do you need the experience of like,\n\nbeing in the actual location?\n\nThat's a thing I don't know.\n\nBecause it's this theoretical...\n\nWhen I can have a conversation\n\nwith an image making device that is natural,\n\nthat is to say, if I say in real time,\n\nyou know, wouldn't it be cool if the that back wall\n\nwas like another 10 feet away, and the sun\n\nwas like, just nicking the horizon\n\nso that during the take the sun just goes down\n\nand now this ambient light takes over.\n\nYou know, that.\n\nAnd if that's happening as we speak,\n\nthat's an interesting way to understand\n\nvisual language. Right.\n\nBut is it a replacement for?\n\nI don't know. That's a thing I don't know.\n\nBut it is a fun conversation.\n\nI can see...\n\nThe thing that's weird is that people think like,\n\nOh, that's a great way to make storyboards\n\nor to make pre-visualized shots\n\nthat then you could take the set\n\nand use that to shoot with.\n\nYes, that's true.\n\nBut there's very little difference then\n\nbetween that and the actual shot, you know?\n\nYeah. But you also...\n\nWe've spoken in the past before\n\nand you, you know, have done all\n\nyour physical storyboards, like,\n\nyou hand draw everything for The Watchmen.\n\nIs AI gonna take a lot of the creative process\n\nout for you, if you're just like talking\n\nto the chat bot and saying, Draw this frame for me.\n\nDraw the sun setting.\n\nYeah, that's where I think the problem\n\nis for me, personally.\n\nI don't think that the drawing of it\n\nis so specific. Mh-hm! Mh-hm!\n\nAnd I'm not interested in the\n\nAI's interpretation of what I'm saying.\n\nRight. That's where\n\nthe rubber hits the road, I think, for me.\n\nAnd where I think the technology\n\nis really kind of quickly changing\n\nbecause it is quickly changing from\n\na suggestion like, Hey, I wanna see 1920s L.A.\n\n[Hemal] Right.\n\nYou know, like a woman walking\n\nwith a suitcase down to Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nIt'll give you its concept of that,\n\nand it'll be pretty awesome.\n\nBut it's not necessarily, if I drew it over here\n\nand then went like this, I'd be like,\n\nOh.\n\nIt's close, but it's not your vision.\n\nIt's close, but that's its own.\n\nYeah. Take.\n\nAnd I think that's where I think\n\nthe tool will become...\n\nAnd it's happening this moment, all the AI,\n\nlike, you know, video generators\n\nand image generators, they're the few holy grails\n\nthat came up immediately are staying on model.\n\nYou know, that's a big deal, right?\n\nLike, can I do two shots of you\n\nthat are like, okay, a closeup\n\nand a wide shot where you look the same?\n\nThat was a bit of a problem, you know?\n\nBut now they're starting to work that out because.\n\nWell, let me ask you, are you overall...\n\nWell, I'm not gonna ask you 'cause I think,\n\nI will already say we've talked a little bit before,\n\nbut you are generally very optimistic\n\nabout the use of artificial intelligence\n\nin filmmaking, in the creative process.\n\nYou do not come to it from a perspective\n\nof That technology shouldn't be involved\n\nin artistic endeavor.\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nI mean, I'm definitely not a gloom and doom\n\nAI person at all.\n\nI think that I've done so many movies\n\nwith so much visual effects, and so much technology\n\nand I've lived in a very virtual world\n\nwhen it comes to filmmaking,\n\nand also very organic handheld world.\n\nAnd those two worlds have mixed a lot for me too.\n\nSo I think for me personally, you know,\n\nI sort of put performance at the front,\n\nyou know, at the head of it.\n\nI think if you're capturing an incredible\n\nperformance, everything else around the actors,\n\nthat's context.\n\nYou know? And that's all it is.\n\nAnd so I think that...\n\nAnd AI...\n\nLook, I don't know that anyone's\n\ninterested in the AI's story.\n\nRight. Or its point of view.\n\nRight.\n\nYou know, maybe they are.\n\nThat's cool.\n\nThat's another sub genre.\n\nBut I think that for me, I think that\n\nit seems eager to get at\n\nwhat the stories that people are trying to tell.\n\nYou know, and I think that in the same way\n\nthat when, we all...\n\n'Cause look, every single person has a pretty good camera\n\nOn their phone. Pretty good camera\n\non their phone. Yeah.\n\nEvery single person.\n\nA pretty good movie camera.\n\nYeah. Yes.\n\nA legit movie camera.\n\nAnd yet, you know, we don't have\n\nright this second anyway, maybe that'll change.\n\nI hope it does.\n\nBut we don't have millions of awesome movies\n\njust being uploaded out of people's pockets.\n\nI feel like the AI represents another tool\n\nthat will help us make movies awesome, I hope.\n\nIt's been my experience that certainly\n\nas a research tool, and a little bit\n\nas an image making tool, I've found it really interesting.\n\nI'm curious to see how you're using it.\n\n'cause like I said, you have it on your phone,\n\nyou talking to it, asking it questions.\n\nIs it becoming a person to you?\n\nYour AI chat bot?\n\nPerson? That sounds weird.\n\nBut I mean- Is it\n\ndeveloping a personality?\n\n[laughs] You know, what it does say,\n\nUm. Which I find really interesting.\n\nSo when it's explaining something, it'll go,\n\nUm, you know, the Golden Gate bridge is, um.\n\nAnd I'm like, Oh, that's, that's cool.\n\nOr it'll breathe, you know, it inhales.\n\nOh. Which I think\n\nthat's all in the programming.\n\nIt's a Chat GPT for the, the language model.\n\nAnd it does [sighs] anyway.\n\nIt does that, you know, and it goes, [sighs].\n\nYou can hear they program that inhale\n\nand they program the, Um.\n\nobviously to make it Yeah.\n\nMore natural, right?\n\nAnd it's way better than like, look,\n\nI have the elevens lab reader.\n\nDo you know that company?\n\nAmazing. Yes.\n\nAnd I find that the voice on the Chat GPT\n\nis a scale more natural than that even.\n\nAnd it's just really...\n\nI don't know how it works, but it's awesome.\n\nSo you were talking about how performance\n\nis actually really important to your filmmaking process\n\nand how you've already used tools before.\n\nDo you think filmmakers should be required\n\nto disclose that they've used AI generators?\n\nIt's an interesting question.\n\nYou know, does the audience want that?\n\nYou know, I think is a better question\n\nonly because I mean...\n\nCertainly we don't ask,\n\nwhen you go see a movie,\n\nlike a Marvel film or a superhero movie\n\nthat has a lot of visual effects.\n\nAre people interested in knowing when\n\nthat was a digital double, that was really the person.\n\nYeah. Or is it the moment.\n\nOr afterward maybe, maybe that's the conversation\n\nafter you've seen the film,\n\nOh, we used AI in these little sections.\n\nOr is the question like,\n\nwhether it is an entirely AI generated movie?\n\nI feel like if that happened, we would know about it.\n\nFirst of all, everyone they would\n\nlove it or hate it or whatever that would be,\n\nI don't know.\n\nThat's still, I think up to debate.\n\nAbout how we feel about it. Yeah.\n\nAbout images being created that way.\n\nI mean, you've seen that Coke commercial.\n\nDo you see that Coke commercial?\n\nThe polar bear commercial? Yeah.\n\nThe polar bear spot. Yeah.\n\nI mean.\n\nWas the point for it not to fool us?\n\nI couldn't-\n\nI'm not even gonna talk about,\n\nI wouldn't speculate on that,\n\nthe Coca-Cola commercial right now.\n\nBecause, okay, obviously this is an AI generator.\n\nMaybe they wanted to make it, Right.\n\nLike really, obviously AI.\n\nDeliberately make a lot of people angry.\n\nYeah. Yeah,\n\nBut what made them angry, do you know?\n\nSo it sounds like you're advocating\n\nfor a really specific use of AI\n\nin your filmmaking, or leaving the door open for it.\n\nYou know, to me it's- But not replacing anything.\n\nI don't think it's replacing anything.\n\nAnd I don't know why you would want it to right now,\n\nbecause it's really quite, I mean, I think it's great.\n\nLike I say, you can imagine costume designers,\n\nproduction designers, editors, everyone having\n\nthis kind of central hub that the AI\n\nkind of manages and as a way of\n\nsort of creating an overall aesthetic\n\nthat is consistent and that where everyone can...\n\nBecause everyone's checking in,\n\neveryone is constantly sort of\n\nreaffirmed in the aesthetic of the\n\nYeah. Project.\n\nAnd you can imagine that that could be\n\nreally efficiently and kind of seamlessly\n\ncurated by an AI kind of,\n\nyou know, point of view.\n\nThat is to say that every time on this project,\n\nevery time we ask it a question,\n\nit's answering it from the point of view of-\n\n[Hemal] Right.\n\nThe aesthetic of the film. Right.\n\nWhich I think could be really awesome for, you know,\n\nsome immersive kind of movie making experience,\n\nwhether it be like, you know, I don't know,\n\nlike an animated film, Avatar.\n\nI don't know, something that really requires\n\na singular, That kind of focus.\n\nPoint of view, yeah. On that technology.\n\nSo you're talking about it in terms\n\nof, like, efficiency.\n\nHow do you see it changing the industry?\n\nI see it changing the industry.\n\nI mean, it'll be interesting its impact on visual effects.\n\nThe effects. Obviously that's\n\nhappening right now.\n\nBut like, motion capture, voiceover artists,\n\nanimators.\n\nYeah. I mean, voice over artists-\n\nIt has the potential to be very disruptive.\n\nYeah. That makes me nervous.\n\nI feel like you probably, you don't want it,\n\nyou know, voicing things.\n\nI mean, it can, obviously. Yeah.\n\nWhat I just said, you know?\n\nIt says Um. Pretty well. [Hemal laughing]\n\nBut I feel like...\n\nI feel like if there's an author\n\nand an artist at its base, then I think it's cool, you know?\n\nRight.\n\nBut it's not going to take away that,\n\nbut it is gonna streamline the industry.\n\nIt is going to kind of send ripples all the way through.\n\nI think it's doing that right now.\n\nIt absolutely is doing it right now.\n\nAnd I think that's what I'm saying is that\n\neducating yourself and understanding what it can do\n\nand what it can't do is important right now.\n\nEspecially at where it exists in image making\n\nand storytelling.\n\nBecause I think if you're in now and understand it\n\nwhat it's not capable of as well,\n\nI think that that's important.\n\nI think that you can really use it as a tool.\n\nYeah. As opposed to fighting it\n\nor as opposed to sort of standing on the sidelines,\n\nyou know, kind of with your hands on your hips.\n\nIt's going. Yeah.\n\nI mean, look, six months ago is different from now,\n\nand six months from now will be\n\nmuch different from where we are.\n\nAnd I think that it's important to stay with it.\n\nBasically, you're gonna be left behind\n\nif you don't embrace it.\n\n[Zach hums]\n\nDid I put words in your mouth?\n\nNo, no. But I'm worried. Yeah.\n\nIf you don't. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So you're worried if you don't.\n\nAnd like, I think you used the analogy\n\nputting toothpaste back in the tube, right?\n\n[Zach] The toothpaste is not going back on the tube.\n\nIt's not going back on that one.\n\nNo. All right.\n\nWell, shifting gears away from AI for a little bit.\n\nWe've got a few minutes left.\n\nI wanted to talk to you.\n\nYou've done a lot about streaming.\n\nAre you still invested in theatrical releases?\n\nYeah, I think that movies absolutely\n\ncan and should be experienced in the theater.\n\nI never really, like...\n\nWhen I made the Netflix films that I've made,\n\nthe two I've made, well, three really.\n\nBut the...\n\nFour, five. There's a lot.\n\nThere was a lot of cuts, you know how I am.\n\nBut the... [Hemal laughing]\n\nAnd then the TV show, I forgot about that.\n\nBut anyway the process of working\n\nin the format of a streamer, for me,\n\nI was really very clear about,\n\nOkay, I'm making a movie for TV.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nI'm not under any kind of misconception\n\nthat I'm making a movie for the theater.\n\nI'm happy to do that if that's the assignment\n\nand that's the way it's gonna be shown.\n\nBut like, you know, we know that\n\nso much of the material, like,\n\nwhen you make a movie that's going to play on Netflix,\n\nchances are if your movie ever is shown on Netflix,\n\nmore people will see it on Netflix\n\nthan ever saw it in the theater.\n\nRight? Right, right.\n\nThat's just a fact.\n\nAnd even a big blockbuster, you make\n\nblockbusters in the theaters, and then\n\nit gets licensed by Netflix.\n\nMore people will see it probably\n\non Netflix than also saw your Blockbuster.\n\n[Hemal] You're just going after the eyeballs.\n\nBut what I'm saying is that...\n\nAnd I'm not necessarily a pure eyeball guy.\n\nOkay. Because I don't...\n\nYou know, a lot of the movies that I've made\n\nhave a very particular audience\n\nand they're made in a very particular way.\n\nAnd they're not necessarily, you know,\n\npure mass audience.\n\nThat's not the way I think it happened.\n\nIt can happen, that's fine.\n\nBut what I'm saying is that\n\nthe assignments are different.\n\nAnd I'm fine if you're asking me\n\nto make a movie for your streaming,\n\n[Hemal] You're not precious about it.\n\nI'm not gonna say like,\n\nHey, like, I'm not an artist if it's not in a theater.\n\nYou know, like, that feels rude.\n\nI mean, that's great. Yeah.\n\nOnly because you're paying for the movie.\n\nRight. You know,\n\nyou're the streamer.\n\nYou're like, This is our format.\n\nWe have a giant streaming service.\n\n250 million people are gonna look at it\n\non their phone, probably.\n\nYou know?\n\nAnd at the very beginning of our conversation,\n\nI have to know that's the reality.\n\nRight. If I do,\n\nthen I should be fine with everything that happens after it.\n\nRight. But you're fine with that, though?\n\nLike, with Netflix?\n\nWell, I have an amazing relationship with Netflix.\n\nI think they're incredible.\n\nLike the pipe that delivers your ideas\n\nto people who are enjoying it, is pretty efficient.\n\nAt the same time, I would say that\n\nif the assignment was, if you were,\n\nUniversal Studios, and you came to me\n\nand said, Hey, we wanna make a movie\n\nthat's like a big theatrical release.\n\nYeah. You know,\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI'd be like, That sounds amazing.\n\nI'd love that.\n\nIMAX, why not?\n\nOne last final question for you.\n\nIn the few minutes that we have left here.\n\nWith technology, with like streaming being\n\nthe primary way people consume movies right now,\n\nwhat is the story that you are most excited to tell?\n\nSo, do you mean, like, just for me personally?\n\nWith this technology, like with AI technology,\n\nI think you mentioned that like AI\n\nwas gonna let you do things that you hadn't\n\nreally figured out how to do yet.\n\nYeah, no, it's an interesting...\n\nI mean, I feel like I guess that's it, you know.\n\nThe way I see it working right now\n\nis really as an incubator, in kind of\n\nthe most efficient way possible.\n\nYou know, like, I can experiment, I can feel,\n\nI can work on things that normally\n\nwould require a big amount of effort from everybody.\n\nAnd that I can have ready on the day\n\nwhen now we have the crew standing by.\n\nBut like, you know, I think\n\nthat there's no substitute for, you know,\n\nwalking down a gritty street with an actor\n\nand me with the camera.\n\nI don't know that anyone would ever want\n\nthe sort of AI version of that.\n\nI don't know that that's...\n\nI mean, it could be done, but I just\n\ndon't know that-\n\n[Hemal] I mean, it can be done.\n\nThere's no need. Right.\n\nSo like there isn't a need for it.\n\nAnd also you're saying that it would strip\n\nlike the personal vision out of it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I'm not even saying that.\n\nI'm just saying that like, you know,\n\nthere is a texture and sort of a point of view.\n\nI think in the end, I always say this about filmmakers.\n\nYou know, my thing is that the only thing you have\n\nas a filmmaker is your point of view.\n\nThat's it.\n\nYou're not right. You're not wrong.\n\nYou're not morally correct.\n\nYou're not morally wrong.\n\nOkay. You are just you.\n\nYou are like a prism.\n\nAnd so the way you see kind of shines through you\n\nAnd goes.\n\nLike, my favorite movies are movies\n\nwhere I can kind of feel the director's hand\n\na little bit, right? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nTheir guide, they're showing me things\n\nI wouldn't have thought of.\n\nAnd I think that in the end,\n\nthat's what it comes back to, is that\n\nI want that point of view, that human point of view\n\nto really be kind of moving me, like\n\nin a narrative way through a story\n\nthat I wouldn't have thought of,\n\nor that I couldn't imagine what's gonna happen next.\n\nAnd I just think that that's really what we,\n\nas audiences, that's what we pay for.\n\nThat's what we hunger for.\n\nAnd so how that's gotten to,\n\nlike what tools are used to get to that\n\nvery human thing, that could change.\n\nYou're not precious about the tools that you're using.\n\n[Zach] I'm precious about that voice.\n\nThe vision and the voice. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAll right.\n\nWell, I think that's a great way\n\nfor us to end it off.\n\nZach, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys. [audience clapping]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nEven in death,\n\nthe secrets of Jeffrey Epstein remained tightly guarded.\n\nBut earlier this year,\n\nI spearheaded a WIRED investigation\n\nthat uncovered the data of almost 200 mobile phones\n\nbelonging to visitors to his infamous Pedophile Island.\n\nThe data was so precise,\n\nwe were able to map the paths\n\nof these visitors to within centimeters,\n\nincluding their neighborhoods, buildings of origins,\n\nand the paths they took to get to the island.\n\nThese digital trails document the numerous trips\n\nof wealthy and influential individuals,\n\nseemingly undeterred by Epstein's status\n\nas a convicted sex offender.\n\nWIRED's analysis of the data is ongoing\n\nand it raises profound questions\n\nabout privacy and surveillance.\n\nThis is Epstein Island's Secret Data, On The Grid.\n\nThis is Little Saint James, AKA Epstein Island.\n\nThese red dots on the map\n\nrepresent some of the 11,279 coordinates I obtained.\n\nThey were left exposed online by a location data broker\n\nwith ties to the Defense Department\n\ncalled Near Intelligence.\n\nBetween 2016 and Epstein's final arrest in 2019,\n\nNear collected data on more than 200 cell phones\n\nthat visited the island.\n\nWe don't know why they did that,\n\nor which client or prospective client of Near\n\ndecided to query the data in this way to produce the maps.\n\nBut the maps you'll see in this video,\n\nshow where visitors to Epstein Island\n\nspent most of their time.\n\nLet's take a step back.\n\nYou might be wondering, Where is Epstein Island anyways?\n\nWell, it's here, Little Saint James is a private island\n\nthat is part of the U.S .Virgin Islands,\n\nan unincorporated territory\n\nof the United States in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nEpstein purchased Little Saint James\n\nin 1998 for $7.95 million.\n\nIt's about 71 acres, the size of 54 football fields.\n\nHe made the island his primary residence,\n\nand soon after, began welcoming visitors\n\nand throwing infamous parties where he was accused\n\nof having groomed, sexually assaulted,\n\nand trafficked untold numbers of women and girls.\n\nThe maps of the data collected by Near,\n\nand which we at WIRED recreated here,\n\nindicate the most visited spots on the island.\n\nFrom the main house here with the pool,\n\nto the beaches and the large sundial,\n\nit's all on display,\n\nincluding the enigmatic Hilltop Temple site over here,\n\nwhich has been the focal point and speculations\n\nabout Epstein's mysterious activities on the island.\n\nBut the tracking of phones,\n\nwasn't contained to Little Saint James,\n\nsurveillance continued long after the visitors left.\n\nThe data reveals the locations of visitors\n\n30 minutes before and after arriving on the island,\n\nwhich shows us the exact routes everyone took to get there.\n\nSome landed here, at the Cyril E. King Airport\n\non neighboring Saint Thomas Island.\n\nWith its private jet and VIP terminals,\n\nit was the go-to hub\n\nfor Epstein's 200-seater Boeing 727 plane\n\ndubbed Lolita Express.\n\nWe see data points clustered at various area beaches,\n\nhotels, and luxury resorts,\n\nincluding the Ritz Carlton Hotel here.\n\nTo get to Epstein's Island,\n\nmany visitors got on a boat at a designated dock\n\nat the American Yacht Harbor,\n\na private marina on Saint Thomas,\n\nco-owned by Epstein at the time.\n\nFrom there, we see a flow of movement\n\nthrough Great Saint James Island,\n\na larger island just to the north,\n\nwhich Epstein purchased in 2016 for $22 million.\n\nHe had hoped to develop it,\n\nbut was met with legal challenges\n\nafter damaging the island's coral reefs\n\nand protected habitats.\n\nThe data then traces visitors' movements\n\nas they were ferried to Epstein's private dock\n\non Little Saint James.\n\nEpstein also had a helipad on the island\n\nand owned at least one helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76\n\nwhich he used often to transport himself, guests,\n\nand victims from the airport or elsewhere,\n\naccording to legal documents and testimony.\n\nIt's worth noting that the data reveals\n\na regular flow of traffic to and from Little Saint James,\n\nbetween 2016 and 2019.\n\nA lot of people were visiting the island,\n\neven after eps Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008,\n\nand served jail time for procuring a minor for prostitution.\n\nIf we keep following the data trail\n\nand we widen our view,\n\nwe'll see that the tracking of visitors\n\ncontinues once they have left the island,\n\nand presumably gone back home.\n\nThe Near Intelligence data we uncovered,\n\npinpoints 166 locations throughout the United States,\n\nin 80 cities across 26 states.\n\nTopping the list were Florida, Massachusetts, Texas,\n\nMichigan, and New York.\n\nThe data points are labeled as Common Evening Locations,\n\nor Common Daytime Locations.\n\nTypically, their homes are work.\n\nMany of the visitors were likely wealthy,\n\nas indicated by coordinates\n\npointing gated communities in Michigan,\n\nas well as homes in Martha's Vineyard,\n\nand Nantucket in Massachusetts.\n\nWe even have data points from a Downtown Miami nightclub,\n\nand also the sidewalk across the street\n\nfrom Trump Tower in New York City.\n\nBefore we jump to conclusions,\n\nsome sources have highlighted interactions\n\nbetween Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein at social events.\n\nBut after Epstein's 2008 conviction,\n\nthere are no verified reports\n\nof Trump maintaining a relationship\n\nwith a convicted pedophile.\n\nTake a look at this point over here in New Mexico,\n\nthis is a property that was owned by Epstein,\n\na secluded 8,000-acre ranch.\n\nAnother property of Epstein's\n\nis seen over here on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThis waterfront mansion was sold, demolished,\n\nand is now being rebuilt,\n\nbut it was where prosecutors claimed Epstein trafficked\n\nnumerous underage girls\n\nwith the intention of molesting and abusing them.\n\nBut we don't just see the coordinates\n\nof wealthy homes amongst the data.\n\nThe median household income of Palm Beach\n\nis more than twice that of nearby communities\n\nwhere we also see data points.\n\nSome of these points could represent victims or employees\n\nwho worked on the island,\n\nwhich is why we're careful about revealing names,\n\nand continue to carefully analyze the data.\n\nIf we zoom out more, we notice something strange.\n\nThere are no data points anywhere in Europe.\n\nDoes this mean it was strictly Americans\n\nvisiting Jeffrey Epstein on his island?\n\nNo, we do see data points from the cache identifying\n\norigin cities in Australia, the Cayman Islands,\n\nand way over here in Kiev in Ukraine.\n\nWe know that Epstein himself had a place in Paris,\n\nand we know from victim testimony and flight logs\n\nthat his associate, Jean-Luc Brunel,\n\nowner of a modeling agency in Paris\n\ndid visit the island.\n\nSo why don't we see these data points?\n\nOne possibility could be Europe's extensive privacy laws.\n\nConsidered the strongest\n\nprivacy and security law in the world,\n\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR,\n\ngives Europeans robust rights to their personal data,\n\neven outside of Europe.\n\nUnder comparatively lax US privacy laws,\n\nNear intelligence was able to source its location data\n\nfor this precision surveillance.\n\nTo explain how this data\n\nmight have been collected in the first place,\n\nwe need to talk about\n\nthe world of digital advertising and data brokers.\n\nThe reason you get a targeted ad\n\ndisplayed on an app or a website\n\nis because apps on your phone\n\nhave been transmitting information about you\n\nto ad exchanges in real-time bidding platforms,\n\nthat information often includes your location data.\n\nData brokers, like Near Intelligence,\n\nextract, repackage, analyze,\n\nand sell the data from these ad platforms.\n\nIn fact, according to internal company documents from 2019,\n\nNear Intelligence, which has roots in Singapore\n\nand Bengaluru, India,\n\nclaimed to have information\n\non around 1.6 billion people in 44 countries.\n\nThey offer a platform for searching\n\nthat allows their clients to query their vast dataset,\n\nby drawing a box around a specific area\n\nlike Little Saint James,\n\nNear then provides insights\n\nabout the devices that observed within the selected area.\n\nWe don't know who or why someone searched Epstein Island,\n\nbut the reports and maps they created\n\nwere sitting unprotected and totally searchable\n\nas publicly accessible code,\n\nand that's where we found them.\n\nAnd those aren't the only\n\nNear Intelligence data sets that we found.\n\nGoogle's web crawlers were able to locate\n\nat least two other reports,\n\none geofencing the Westfield Mall in the Netherlands,\n\nand another target in a park in El Paso, Texas.\n\nThis is data\n\nunrelated to our investigation about Epstein Island,\n\nbut it shows how unsafe personal data can be.\n\nIn some cases, it's just a Google search away.\n\nSo Pro Tip, if you don't want your personal data\n\nswimming around in the murky waters\n\nor programmatic advertising,\n\nmake sure you limit ad tracking on your phone,\n\ndisable location services and third-party cookies,\n\nand use an ad blocker.\n\nSo what happened to the island\n\nafter Epstein reportedly committed suicide\n\nin a Manhattan federal jail\n\nwhile awaiting trial for sex trafficking?\n\nWell, in May of 2023,\n\nbillionaire investor Stephen Deckoff,\n\npurchased both Little Saint James\n\nand Great Saint James for $60 million.\n\nHe's currently building a luxury resort\n\non Little Saint James,\n\nthat he says could open as early as 2025.\n\nAlso, Ghislaine Maxwell,\n\nformer British socialite and Epstein accomplice,\n\nwas convicted in 2021 on five counts,\n\nincluding sex trafficking of minors by force.\n\nMaxwell was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire\n\ntracked to a million-dollar home by federal agents\n\nusing location data pulled from her cell phone.\n\nI'm Dhruv Mehrotra,\n\nthe WIRED Investigation\n\ninto the Secret Data of Epstein's Island continues.",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Shilpi Mehta-Lee and I'm a high-risk pregnancy doctor.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Pregnancy Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@kingeniola asks, Apparently I can up my chances\n\nof having twins if I eat loads of yams.\n\nPlease confirm.\n\nIt turns out, probably not.\n\nWhere this comes from is the Yuruba people of Nigeria\n\nhave a specific yam\n\nthat has a lot of estrogen-like chemicals in it,\n\nand that area of the world\n\nhas a really high incidence of twinning\n\nand it's thought that perhaps this particular white yam\n\ncaused twinning to be increased in that patient population.\n\nWhether you eat yams from your local grocery store\n\nand that causes twinning is yet to be determined.\n\nAt @alybarrington asked,\n\nDid you know they had pregnancy tests\n\nin ancient Egyptian society?\n\nThis stuff is so damn cool.\n\nYes, in fact, they did have pregnancy tests\n\nin ancient Egyptian society.\n\nWomen would urinate on these two bags of grain,\n\nbarley and wheat, that were responsive to estrogen,\n\nand if those grains sprouted,\n\nit meant that the mother was pregnant.\n\nIt's thought to have been about 70\n\nto 80% accurate at detecting pregnancy,\n\nwhich is really quite amazing.\n\nNow we have a filtration type of lab\n\nthat you can do literally at home.\n\nYou pee on a stick.\n\nThe beta HCG, the human chorionic gonadotropin\n\nthat is formulated\n\nwhen the embryo is forming in your uterus,\n\nis excreted really early on,\n\nso probably not the first two\n\nto three days after you conceive,\n\nbut pretty much right after that.\n\nAnd when you have high levels of HCG,\n\nas it's filtering through that stick,\n\nif there's a positive result,\n\nyou'll see two lines\n\nbecause the HCG will bind to one of the lines.\n\nIf it's a negative result, you'll only see one line\n\nbecause it's just the control.\n\n@kaecinema asks, How the hell does an ultrasound work?\n\nIt's like a hack where they see right through you.\n\nIt kind of is a hack where we do see right through you.\n\nThis all started in the time of World War I\n\nand World War II where you were using sound waves\n\nthrough water to detect a submarine.\n\nThey recognized that there was a medical application to this\n\nwhere you could use sound waves\n\nto hit the fetal skin and walls\n\nand really create an image on a computer screen.\n\nThis is a two-dimensional image.\n\nThe probe is coming through the maternal skin\n\nfrom about here\n\nand reflecting sound waves through the amniotic fluid\n\nback onto the probe in order to create a computer-generated,\n\ntwo-dimensional image.\n\nMore recently, there's been a development\n\nof three-dimensional fetal imaging\n\nthat still uses that same sound wave technology\n\nto create a three-dimensional image of your fetus.\n\nNow on these 3D images,\n\nyou can see more lifelike fetal images,\n\nbut we don't use them so much\n\nin diagnosing medical problems.\n\nWe really still rely very heavily\n\non those two-dimensional images to diagnose fetal issues.\n\n@toedavb asks, Is it okay to exercise during pregnancy?\n\nRegular and routine exercise in pregnancy\n\nis completely safe.\n\nThe fetus is in a pool of amniotic fluid.\n\nIt's always moving.\n\nIt's in a constant state of sort of anti-gravity,\n\nso we don't really think\n\nthat it feels the jostling of movement up and down\n\nwhen you go for a 5K run\n\nor any sort of run.\n\n@Simply-Tootsiie ask, Why TF when you pregnant,\n\neverything smells so effing weird?\n\nAll of my patients say, I can smell so much more.\n\nIt smells different. It smells funny.\n\nThere is an evolutionary theory about this.\n\nIt may help you to prevent eating something that's toxic\n\nto either yourself or the pregnancy during that time.\n\n@athonymw asks, What is vanishing twin syndrome\n\nand what are the causes?\n\nThis is a uterus and there is a fetus here,\n\nand this is one gestational sac\n\nand then there's a second empty gestational sac.\n\nAnd what that means\n\nis this pregnancy most likely formed two embryos,\n\nbut only one made it to the stage\n\nwhere you can see a small embryo and a heartbeat,\n\nand that's called a vanishing twin.\n\nThat twin vanished.\n\nThe other twin will go on to form a totally normal embryo.\n\nA vanishing twin in the first trimester\n\nis not considered to be a dangerous outcome\n\nthat causes an adverse pregnancy outcome.\n\nA lot of times when a twin gestation form,\n\n20 or 30% of the time,\n\nthere's a vanishing twin.\n\nIt's thought to be the main driver of this test\n\nthat we now do on most pregnant women\n\ncalled non-invasive prenatal testing being falsely positive.\n\nEvery once in a while,\n\nwhen we do that test and we sequence that DNA,\n\nthere's an extra chromosome 21, 13, or 18,\n\nor a change in the sex chromosome material.\n\nThat's thought to be because in vanishing twin syndrome,\n\nthe DNA may still be floating around\n\nin the maternal bloodstream\n\nand cause a false-positive result\n\nif that vanished twin was actually abnormal.\n\n@BlueNeptune asks,\n\nDo you think babies can taste in the womb?\n\nLike damn, that [beep] is eating spaghetti again?\n\nActually, flavor molecules can pass\n\nfrom the maternal bloodstream through the placenta\n\nand into the amniotic cavity.\n\nIt's possible that there are flavor molecules passing\n\ninto the fetal mouth and through the nose\n\nso that they can smell and taste what the mom eats.\n\nInfants do gravitate towards similar food choices\n\nas their moms do,\n\nso it's possible that that flavor conditioning\n\nand flavor imprinting happens in utero\n\nrather than just after they're born.\n\n@mesopissed asks, How the [beep] am I supposed to know\n\nif I'm going into labor\n\nwhen I've never been in labor before?\n\nThis is a tough question because it's true.\n\nThe vast majority of first time moms don't really know\n\nwhat labor feels like.\n\nThere's one really great rule of thumb\n\nin explaining how a patient can know that they're in labor.\n\nWe use the 5-1-1 rule.\n\nThat's where a patient feels cramping and contractions\n\nand pain in their abdomen\n\nand in through their pelvis every five minutes.\n\nAnd that pain lasts approximately one minute\n\nand it lasts for over an hour.\n\nAnd if it's happening\n\nand you have an hour of contractions,\n\nyou might wanna head to the hospital\n\nor at least call your doctor.\n\n@minetiract asks, Wait, do babies cry in the womb?\n\nThe amniotic fluid that is in the mother's uterus\n\nmakes it so that babies can't make really any sound,\n\nbut there are some studies to show\n\nthat perhaps at 28 weeks,\n\nbabies can start doing practice grimacing in the womb.\n\nWhen we are performing ultrasound,\n\nwe actually look for different kinds of practice movements.\n\nSo we're looking for practice breathing,\n\nwhich is where the diaphragm goes up and down,\n\nand you might be able to see fluid coming in\n\nand out of the nostrils,\n\nbut we don't usually look for practice crying.\n\n@Vhusie_N says, Cryptic pregnancy will always shock me\n\n'cause what do you mean you had cramps\n\nand the next thing you were giving birth?\n\nA cryptic pregnancy is where you don't know you're pregnant\n\nuntil the end of the pregnancy or the third trimester.\n\nCryptic pregnancy probably happens about one in 500 times.\n\nWe think that it most likely happens\n\nfor one of two sets of reasons.\n\nOne, there was some irregularity in your periods,\n\nor you were breastfeeding so that you didn't get periods,\n\nor you had bleeding in the early part of your pregnancy,\n\nso you didn't know you were missing a period.\n\nAnd the other part of cryptic pregnancy\n\nprobably has to do with mental health,\n\npatients who didn't recognize they were pregnant\n\ndue to mental health condition.\n\n@allicatto asks, Are you telling me that the easiest way\n\nto avoid cleaning cat litter is to be pregnant?\n\nWe really do advise women\n\nnot to change cat litter in pregnancy.\n\nThat's because some cats carry a parasite\n\ncalled toxoplasmosis\n\nand it can cause birth defects.\n\nToxoplasmosis isn't only found in the cat litter.\n\nIt can be found in the ground and in undercooked foods.\n\nIn other countries, like in Europe, specifically France,\n\nthere can be a higher level of exposure to toxoplasmosis\n\nbecause of undercooked meats and cheeses\n\nand things that may expose patients to parasites.\n\nThey actually test for it.\n\nIn the United States, it's less ubiquitous\n\nand we don't find that there's a need to test for it.\n\n@finstanSG says,\n\nAt how many weeks do you think a fetus becomes viable?\n\nThe early third trimester, probably at about 24 weeks.\n\nThat's when a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.\n\nThat may change with advances in neonatology\n\nand in technologies that can help earlier\n\nand earlier fetuses survive.\n\n@Kofi99 asks, Babies can poo inside the womb?\n\nYes, babies can poo inside the womb.\n\nWe call it meconium.\n\nMeconium is really a natural byproduct\n\nof swallowing the skin cells\n\nand the hair cells in the amniotic fluid\n\nall the way through the first, second,\n\nand third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nThis happens about 13% of the time,\n\nand we can see that greenish tinge\n\nto the amniotic fluid at birth.\n\nIt can be important in the neonatal period\n\nbecause an increase in meconium\n\ncan sometimes make it more difficult\n\nfor babies to breathe once they're born.\n\n@trash_netflix says, How does Plan B work?\n\nIt basically delays ovulation for about 72 hours.\n\nIn a normal pregnancy, we wanna ovulate from our ovary\n\nand that egg comes into the tube\n\nand that's where it meets the sperm either in the tube\n\nor in the uterus.\n\nWhat Plan B does is it basically prevents ovulation\n\nso that there is no egg to meet the sperm during this time,\n\nwhich means you can't conceive\n\nduring the most important 72 hours after sex.\n\n@JanelleAngelie asks, Why does no one talk about\n\nhow terrible the first trimester is?\n\nIn the first trimester of pregnancy,\n\na lot of things are happening.\n\nYour body is changing so much.\n\nYou're getting all that progesterone,\n\nall that estrogen into your bloodstream.\n\nThe embryo is growing from a really small size.\n\nThe vast majority of the fetal organs are forming.\n\nUp to about 12 weeks of pregnancy,\n\nyou're seeing bone and skin and heart structures,\n\nand so organogenesis, that early part of the pregnancy,\n\nis super, super important\n\nand it probably does make you feel a little terrible.\n\n@Kensetsu6 asks, What happens in the second trimester?\n\nThere's continued formation of the organs\n\nthrough the second trimester.\n\nThat's when neurodevelopment begins,\n\nwhen the brain starts developing.\n\nThere's also development of teeth and other organs.\n\nThis is probably about a late second-trimester fetus.\n\nIt's no longer the size of a small embryo.\n\nIt's really growing up to about the mother's belly button\n\nor beyond.\n\nAlso, in the second trimester,\n\npeople start to feel a little bit better\n\nabout the pregnancy.\n\nThey're not feeling that surge of hormones.\n\nThey've sort of acclimated to that surge.\n\nIt's kind of called the golden trimester\n\nbecause people feel less nauseated,\n\nthey have more energy, and they're less fatigued.\n\n@KBrenishiaa says, Last trimester of pregnancy, 0/10.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nThe third trimester of pregnancy,\n\nsomewhere around 25 to 28 weeks,\n\ngoing all the way to when you deliver,\n\ncan be really difficult.\n\nThe fetus is growing about a half a pound a week.\n\nYour uterus is coming up to your diaphragm.\n\nThe uterus is pretty large like the size of a watermelon.\n\nThe uterine walls are really thinned out.\n\nYou're feeling heavier.\n\nYou're feeling more tired.\n\nThis is when all your organs are being sort of pushed\n\nin different directions.\n\nYou might notice a difference in how you walk and move\n\nbecause there's a change in the curvature of your spine.\n\nThere is a lot of fetal development happening\n\nin the third trimester.\n\nThere's vision developing.\n\nThere's taste buds developing.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nat the very tail end of the third trimester,\n\nyou're gonna get fetal lung maturity.\n\nAfter the baby's born,\n\nthey have to be able to take that first breath\n\nand use those lungs.\n\nSo the third trimester is really, really important\n\nfor that time.\n\n@breedp_ says, Why do so many people get pregnant\n\nwith quadruplets?\n\nEh, I don't really think it's true,\n\nbut there is a lot of media attention\n\non higher order multiples,\n\nmultiples that are more than twins,\n\nand that's usually more common\n\nusing assisted reproductive technology.\n\nCurrent technologies really try to avoid\n\nmore than two fetuses in the uterus.\n\nWhen you use in vitro fertilization or IVF,\n\nyou might get pregnant with one, maybe two fetuses.\n\nBut if you use different types\n\nof assisted reproductive technology\n\nthat make your ovaries excrete more eggs,\n\nyou might get pregnant with triplets or quadruplets.\n\nAnd we really, really, really try to avoid that\n\nbecause it's not that safe\n\nfor either the fetuses or the mother.\n\nBefore IVF, the most common reason\n\nwas kind of an error in ovulation.\n\nYou released two eggs at the time you conceived\n\nand you created twins,\n\nso it was more common in older patients,\n\nin patients nearing menopause to have twins.\n\n@Mongieeeeee asks,\n\nThe mortality rate with Black women during pregnancy\n\nand delivery is way higher than any other race.\n\nThat's true.\n\nBlack women have higher risks\n\nof maternal morbidity and mortality in pregnancy\n\nas compared to their white and Hispanic counterparts.\n\nWe're still working on why that is and what the reasons are.\n\nOne is possibly just structural racism\n\nwithin the health community\n\nand the ways we learn about health and healthcare.\n\nOther things include this idea of weathering,\n\nwhere if you face racism every day,\n\nyou actually may have worse health outcomes.\n\n@KashMadonna asks, Do the second pregnancy\n\nmake you show faster or something?\n\nThere is some plausibility to this.\n\nWhen you're pregnant the first time,\n\nyour muscles haven't spread.\n\nThere hasn't been that diastasis of the muscles\n\nin the front of the abdomen yet,\n\nbut in the second pregnancy,\n\nall of that musculature\n\nis already sort of stretched and moved,\n\nand so that growing uterus shows more quickly\n\nbecause there isn't as much of a force downward\n\nas there would be in the first pregnancy.\n\n@neo_manceo asks, Guys, is there a difference\n\nbetween termination of pregnancy and abortion?\n\nYes, there is a slight difference\n\nbetween termination of pregnancy and abortion.\n\nAbortion can be either spontaneous, which means you miscarry\n\nor it can be a termination of pregnancy,\n\nwhere you elect to terminate because there's an abnormality\n\nor for any number of family reasons.\n\n@Daileeeeeen asks, As I keep getting further along\n\nin this pregnancy,\n\nall I want is junk food.\n\nThat is so off brand for me. I'm a healthy girl.\n\nIn the beginning of pregnancy,\n\na lot of women do just eat crackers\n\nbecause they're feeling so nauseated.\n\nDuring that early part of pregnancy,\n\nfetuses are very parasitic.\n\nThey're gonna take all the nutrients they need\n\nfrom the female body\n\nand they're gonna use it\n\nto create this embryo and this fetus.\n\nWhat's really, really, really important in pregnancy\n\nis to eat a healthy and well-balanced nutritious diet.\n\nNutrient-dense foods, so whole grains,\n\ngreen leafy vegetables,\n\nthings that have protein, Omega-3 fatty acids,\n\nanything that has vitamins.\n\nAs a mom, you're expanding your blood volume,\n\nbut also the fetus is actually making\n\nits own new blood cells.\n\nIt needs the components to do so, right, and so do you.\n\nYou need iron, you need B12, you need folic acid.\n\n@rufusjbacon asks, What is a pregnancy glow?\n\nI, for one, have never seen a pregnant person glow.\n\nThere is sort of a pregnancy glow.\n\nIt's one of just those biological things that's happening\n\nas you're getting pregnant and being pregnant.\n\nYour skin might get a little oilier.\n\nYour face might get a little rounder\n\nas you increase the fat content of your subcutaneous tissue.\n\nYou also notice many times stronger nails,\n\nthicker hair, fuller hair\n\nbecause you're not losing hair as much during pregnancy.\n\n@Tharealrambo951 asks,\n\nWhat happens to the baby if you smoke while pregnant?\n\nBabies can be smaller than they would be expected to be.\n\nThat's called small for gestational age.\n\nBabies that don't weigh quite as much\n\nas they should at birth.\n\nThey're also a host of other adverse outcomes\n\nthat we think are associated\n\nwith tobacco smoking during pregnancy.\n\nIncreased risk of abruption,\n\nthat's where the placenta separates from the uterine wall\n\nbefore it's time to deliver\n\nand can cause significant bleeding behind the placenta\n\nand even fetal loss.\n\nSo it's really important to consider quitting smoking\n\nduring pregnancy.\n\n@jacob sctj asks, Like have you seen what happens\n\nto your stomach on the inside as a baby grows?\n\nWhere do your organs shift and move?\n\nIn the very beginning of pregnancy,\n\nyour uterus is really, really small.\n\nIt's just sort of sitting in the lower pelvis.\n\nIt's only about the size of a lemon.\n\nBut as the uterus grows,\n\nit's growing up to your belly button or even higher.\n\nThere are a lot of effects on all of your organs.\n\nMost of the early effects are from progesterone.\n\nSo progesterone is a hormone\n\nthat's secreted by the placenta\n\ninto the maternal bloodstream.\n\nIt sort of lax in all of the cartilage\n\nand those ligaments that are all over your body,\n\nand it makes things looser.\n\nIt makes us able to adapt.\n\nYour intestines, which are really just flexible\n\nand no problem really,\n\nthey can just move aside and push to the sides.\n\nBut over time, in the third trimester, really late,\n\nyou might see that the pregnancy is really coming up\n\ninto your diaphragm.\n\nYou might even feel a little short of breath\n\nas the liver and the lungs are pushed upward.\n\nIt's not an instant quick change\n\nback to its normal shape and size\n\nat the end of the pregnancy.\n\nWomen leave the hospital really feeling\n\nlike they still look pregnant.\n\nThe uterus looks about 20 weeks pregnant,\n\nand as it shrinks down,\n\nall those organs shift and go down.\n\n@MamaMoxieB asks, I really need answers\n\nas to WTF preeclampsia is definitively.\n\nPreeclampsia is where you have an abnormal rise\n\nin your blood pressure at the end of pregnancy.\n\nAnd most likely it's happening\n\nbecause you are having all of these cytokines\n\nand inflammatory markers increasing disproportionately\n\nat the end of pregnancy, causing your body to react,\n\nalmost like it's an autoimmune response.\n\nPreeclampsia is basically caused by endothelial damage,\n\ndamage to the vascular system,\n\nand you can see signs of preeclampsia\n\nwith platelets dropping with your liver enzymes going up.\n\nPeople can develop headaches.\n\nPeople ask if preeclampsia is on the rise,\n\nand it turns out that probably preeclampsia\n\nis somewhat on the rise.\n\nThere's just more recognition\n\nof hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\n\nPatients getting pregnant later in life\n\nor using assisted reproductive technology to get pregnant.\n\nThere's also more obesity, which we think is a risk factor\n\nfor developing preeclampsia.\n\nThere's ongoing research to sort of describe\n\nhow and why preeclampsia happens in certain patients\n\nand not in others.\n\n@lsnxxxx ask, Okay, but like is pregnancy brain real?\n\nBecause during my pregnancy, I swear I felt illiterate.\n\nThere is like 15 to 40 times\n\nmore progesterone floating around in your body\n\nand it does change your brain and the way you think.\n\nAnd by the time the woman delivers,\n\nthey're these huge surges in oxytocin,\n\nwhich can really change the way you're thinking\n\nbecause oxytocin is a pleasure hormone.\n\nIt's really, really possible\n\nthat as we focus more on our pregnancy,\n\nsome of the other extraneous stuff\n\nthat we used to have at top of mind, no longer is.\n\nNow, what's more important\n\nis what's we're carrying in the uterus,\n\nand so there are pregnancy changes.\n\n@delltrick asks, Why do babies in the womb kick\n\nwhen they hear certain music?\n\nSurely they can't have that much experience\n\nbeing not born yet.\n\nLater in pregnancy, probably around 28 weeks,\n\nthe fetal auditory system really starts forming\n\nso they can start to hear.\n\nThey can hear music, maternal organ movement.\n\nAnd there are some studies to suggest\n\nthat auditory stimuli can make your baby move\n\nor kick in a different way,\n\nand that there may be some recognition\n\nof even the maternal voice\n\nor the paternal voice after birth.\n\n@alivo22_vo asks,\n\nWhy do you think it's important\n\nfor women to take prenatal vitamins when pregnant?\n\nEvery pregnancy really should have a prenatal vitamin.\n\nWe recommend them not just during pregnancy,\n\nbut in the three months before you conceive.\n\nYou need to be storing all these vitamins early\n\nin order to form the best and the healthiest fetus\n\nand to keep yourself healthy.\n\nIf you don't have enough folic acid in your bloodstream,\n\nyou're at higher risk\n\nfor developing neural tube complications,\n\ncomplications with your brain and the spine of the fetus.\n\n@Sirilloh ask, Us being pregnant an excuse to eat more\n\nor do pregnant women really need to eat for two?\n\nYou don't need to eat for two during pregnancy.\n\nWhat we really want is to see maybe a slight increase\n\nin caloric intake,\n\nbut not that much.\n\nThe fetus is gonna develop\n\nand grow as it normally would\n\nif you just eat your normal healthy diet.\n\n@dondang_syg asks, 3 months pregnant\n\nand I don't see any baby bump yet.\n\nIs that normal?\n\nIt's pretty common not to see a bump\n\nbecause the pregnancy is really only to about this level\n\nin your pelvis.\n\nSome women show really early,\n\nespecially patients in their second pregnancy\n\ncan really show even at three months pregnancy,\n\nbut others won't show that early.\n\n@taytheg asks, The only thing I've been missing\n\nthis whole pregnancy is sushi.\n\nYour obstetrician or your provider\n\nis not gonna want you to eat sushi during pregnancy.\n\nIt's because it's undercooked\n\nand you have a higher risk of being exposed\n\nto things that aren't safe for the pregnancy,\n\nlike listeria or parasites.\n\nThere are some forms of sushi that you probably can eat.\n\nVegetarian sushi, eel, those are cooked,\n\nso if you're really missing sushi,\n\nyou could try those things.\n\n@moonsyoong asks, Does pregnancy change your voice?\n\nThe short answer to that is probably yes.\n\nPregnancy does change voice.\n\nThere is a change in sort of that nasal congestion\n\nduring pregnancy as all the blood vessels\n\ncome to the surface.\n\nYour nose can kind of feel stuffy\n\nand make your voice sound different.\n\nBut there's also probably some voice box changes happening\n\nas that progesterone\n\nand estrogen is increasing in your bloodstream.\n\n@You_Addicted2Me says,\n\nNobody talks about how your teeth shift so bad during\n\nand after pregnancy enough.\n\nAs the early part of pregnancy has a lot of progesterone,\n\nthere's a change in your gums\n\nand your teeth can move and shift during pregnancy.\n\nIt's not uncommon, and maybe we don't talk about it enough.\n\nThe one thing that a lot of patients notice\n\nis that when they brush their teeth,\n\nthey see a little bit of extra gum bleeding.\n\nThat's completely normal in pregnancy.\n\n@kaykiire asks, I don't know why,\n\nbut I love that little dark line\n\nthat be on pregnant bellies.\n\nThat little dark line is called a linea nigra,\n\nand it's essentially where the two parts\n\nof your abdomen came together\n\nwhen you were in your own mother's uterus.\n\nDuring pregnancy, all the hormones\n\ncan make it so that melanocytes come to the surface,\n\nnot only in that linea nigra,\n\nbut you can notice darker areas in your skin and your face\n\nand other places.\n\n@Lindambui asks, I was today years old\n\nwhen I learned about fetal microchimerism.\n\nAs a mother, I'm simultaneously awed, happy, and terrified.\n\nFetal microchimerism is where there are fetal DNA\n\nor particles in the maternal bloodstream.\n\nThe mother, after she has the fetus, can have those cells\n\nin that DNA in her maternal bloodstream forever.\n\nWhen a woman is donating organs to somebody\n\nthat she's a genetic match for,\n\nfetal microchimerism can make that match\n\na little bit more tenuous\n\nbecause she's got some DNA from her fetuses\n\nin her bloodstream,\n\nso she may not be an exact match.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for asking such fun and interesting questions.\n\nAnd thanks for watching Pregnancy Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

of the Constitution,\n\nthe president is given almost unilateral authority\n\nto issue pardons on federal offenses\n\nexcept for those relating to impeachment.\n\nSo while lots of presidents have issued pardons,\n\nwe don't necessarily like or maybe feel a little bit gross,\n\na president's pardon power is almost unilateral.\n\nGeorge Washington was the first president to issue a pardon.\n\nOne of his first was to a rum smuggler in April of 1794.\n\nSludgegaze asks, Was the political divide always this bad?\n\nThere certainly have been times\n\nwhere we've had very bad partisan tensions and a big divide\n\nbetween the two different political parties.\n\nThe 1790s, the 1850s, the 1890s, and the 1960s\n\nwere all times when political rhetoric\n\nand how people talk to one another were really intense\n\nand often quite nasty.\n\nJohn Adams often referred to one of his political rivals,\n\nAlexander Hamilton, as a puppy,\n\nwhich was the ultimate insult to masculinity in the 1790s.\n\nAnd John Adams' critics\n\nsaid he had a hermaphroditic character\n\nbecause his values constantly shifted.\n\nThere have been times when things have been better,\n\nwhen political campaigns weren't quite so awful,\n\nbut this moment that we're in now is probably as bad\n\nas some of the other ones we've lived through.\n\nHiCatWhisperer asks, How did we end up\n\nwith two stupid unpopular political parties\n\nthat are pretty much our only alternative?\n\nExcellent question.\n\nWe have what's called a two-party system.\n\nThere have been other parties\n\nover the course of American history\n\ngenerally as one of the major parties breaks down\n\nand there are various different factions.\n\nSo for example, in the 1840s and 1850s,\n\nthere was a Know Nothing party, there was the Freedom Party,\n\nthen eventually the Republican Party\n\nmerged a lot of those different factions into one new party.\n\nBecause of the way our primary system works\n\nand the way our Congress works,\n\nit's really hard for a third party to gain any traction,\n\nbut that's not necessarily the case\n\nin other types of systems.\n\nFor example, if you have a parliament like in Great Britain,\n\nthere are lots of parties that have to build coalitions\n\nin order to have governing power.\n\nAlecEmley asks, Why do we even have a State\n\nof the Union address anymore?\n\nIt's a waste of everyone's time.\n\nThe State of the Union is actually required\n\nin the Constitution.\n\nArticle II says that the President shall from time to time\n\ngive updates to Congress on the State of the Union.\n\nGeorge Washington called these his addresses to Congress\n\nand he noted that they were indeed a required act.\n\nWhat's interesting about the states of the Union\n\nis from Thomas Jefferson to Woodrow Wilson,\n\nthey were in writing\n\nand the president would deliver a written address.\n\nWoodrow Wilson went back to delivering this speech in person\n\nand they have been in person at Congress ever since.\n\nAnd here at George Washington's Presidential Library\n\nat Mount Vernon, we have what's called an Acts of Congress.\n\nIn January of 1790, as George Washington prepared\n\nto deliver his first address to Congress\n\nor State of the Union, we think that he made these notations\n\nin his copy of the Constitution\n\nwhere you can see that he has written a notation\n\nthat says required next to the responsibility\n\nto give Congress an update.\n\nAnd indeed he did.\n\nEvery year of his presidency, he went to Congress\n\nand delivered a spoken address\n\ntelling them what had happened while they were on recess\n\nand giving some suggestions for what they might consider\n\nin the upcoming term.\n\nKy_marsh asks, Did you know Teddy Roosevelt\n\nwas shot before a speech and proceeded to give\n\nthe entire 90-minute speech with a bullet in his chest?\n\nYes, I did know that.\n\nA man named John Schrank thought that he was having visions\n\nthat told him to try and defeat Theodore Roosevelt\n\nfrom winning the presidential election in 1912.\n\nNow, what's amazing about why Theodore Roosevelt survived\n\nwas he had the speech folded up in his pocket\n\nand because the speech was so long, the paper was so thick\n\nthat it actually slowed down the bullet and saved his life.\n\nAfter he was shot, Theodore Roosevelt said,\n\nyou can't bring down a Bull Moose,\n\nwhich is where the name Bull Moose party comes from.\n\nRheaSoccerCrazy asks, So apparently teddy bears\n\nwere named after former US Prez Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy?\n\nTheodore Roosevelt went on a bear hunt after his presidency,\n\nbut he wasn't successful, and he couldn't get any,\n\nand it made him really mad.\n\nSo the people he was with actually captured one\n\nand tied it up to a willow tree\n\nso that he would have the opportunity to shoot a bear.\n\nBut he felt like that wasn't very sporting\n\nand wasn't really fair to the bear,\n\nso he refused to kill it.\n\nA political cartoonist depicted this scene\n\nand a candy maker who had a toy and candy store\n\nsaw this cartoon and thought it would make\n\nan excellent children's toy.\n\nThe toy maker received permission to use Teddy's name\n\nfor the bear, and the teddy bear was born\n\nand has been known as such ever since.\n\nBillShine8 asks, Has the peaceful transition of power\n\never been in more doubt?\n\nWell, we have had a number of very dramatic transitions.\n\nSo for example, when President Abraham Lincoln was elected\n\nin 1860, the South seceded before he became president,\n\nso that's about as bad as it gets.\n\nThen in 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected,\n\nit was in the midst of the Great Depression\n\nand economic conditions were horrible,\n\nbut Herbert Hoover really rejected the New Deal programs\n\nthat Franklin D. Roosevelt had suggested\n\nduring the campaign, and they spent several months bickering\n\nover what to do with the election\n\nbefore FDR was finally inaugurated in March of 1933.\n\nThe difference with January 6th\n\nwas that it was a contested transition.\n\nWe have never had one candidate to reject the outcome\n\nof an election, and we've never had people\n\ntry to overthrow the results of an election.\n\nThe South didn't like the result in 1860\n\nand so they left the nation.\n\nThat's a very different thing.\n\nyatpay asks, In the United States,\n\ndoes the president have access to all levels\n\nof classified information?\n\nYes, the president has access to all classified information\n\nand all of the top secrets in the United States.\n\nHockeymadman asks, What does the\n\ndo all day anyway?\n\nSo the president does a lot of different things.\n\nThe president consumes intelligence.\n\nThe president talks with foreign leaders,\n\nmakes really difficult decisions 'cause no easy choices\n\ncome to the Oval Office.\n\nThe President meets with business leaders,\n\nand labor leaders, and members of Congress,\n\nand state governments.\n\nThe president hosts really important social receptions.\n\nThose can be for visiting dignitaries like state dinners.\n\nThey can be from championship teams\n\nthat we see sometimes at the White House\n\nor they can be students or kids\n\nwho they're trying to encourage\n\nto pursue their studies.\n\nWhat you can see here is an invitation\n\nfrom President George Washington to come to an event\n\nat the President's House in Philadelphia.\n\nThis social component of the presidency\n\nwas there from the very beginning\n\nand George Washington hosted events every single week\n\nduring his presidency.\n\ndavidkwong asks, What does the S in Harry S, Truman\n\nstand for?\n\nNothing.\n\nHe added it in later\n\nbecause he thought that he needed a middle initial.\n\nRordan508 asks, Wow, the Supreme Court in America\n\nshows the world USA does not do democracy.\n\nApparently, any incoming\n\ncan stack its highest court like it's a perk of office.\n\nwhile the Supreme Court size\n\nis not actually in the Constitution,\n\nit's totally up to Congress how many seats\n\nthere are going to be on the Supreme Court\n\nat any given moment.\n\nAnd indeed that number has changed.\n\nThe original Supreme Court was six justices\n\nand George Washington appointed all six,\n\nand then the replacements as they left.\n\nThe Supreme Court has evolved over time,\n\nsometimes for political reasons.\n\nFor example, the Federal Judiciary Act of 1801\n\nreduced the size of the Supreme Court making it harder\n\nfor Jefferson to appoint a replacement\n\nbecause he would be from a different party.\n\nTychus_Balrog asks, Why are American elections so long?\n\nWhy not just have them last two to four weeks?\n\nI agree, that would be great, and a lot of other elections\n\nin other nations are much shorter.\n\nOurs have actually expanded over time,\n\nespecially in the last couple of decades\n\nas they've become more expensive,\n\nas they've become competitive.\n\nBut there isn't really anything that says\n\nhow short or how long they can be.\n\nThe problem is if we try and limit that by law,\n\nthat could be a restriction of freedom of speech\n\nand we have a First Amendment, which makes it very difficult\n\nto limit political speech especially.\n\nSavannaahLeigh asks, Damn, did anyone know\n\nthe President Roosevelt had polio and hid it\n\nbecause of how the community saw disabled people?\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nFDR did have polio and he spent most of his presidency\n\nin a wheelchair.\n\nHe was able with the use of braces\n\nand support from his sons and his aides to prop himself up\n\nfor speeches and press conferences,\n\nbut by and large, he was unable to walk.\n\nHe hid it because at the time there was a sense\n\nthat if you were physically disabled,\n\nthat meant you were somehow mentally impaired as well,\n\nand he understood that it would make it much harder for him\n\nto become president and much harder for him\n\nto meet with other foreign leaders\n\nand exercise the type of power\n\nthat a president is required to use.\n\nThe secret largely remained such\n\nbecause the press were willing to cooperate.\n\nIt was pretty clear to people who were around him\n\nthat he couldn't move around,\n\nbut there was sort of a gentleman's agreement\n\nwith the press at the time that this was private information\n\nand it was not their story to share.\n\nFDR never really talked about this\n\nand this was only something that came out much later\n\nas people began to share photos\n\nand his family began to discuss his battle with polio.\n\nEmployeeAromatic6118 asks, What do you think\n\nof George Washington's take on political parties?\n\nGeorge Washington warned against political parties\n\nin his farewell address, which he published in September\n\nof 1796 when he announced his retirement.\n\nBut his ideas about political parties\n\nare often misunderstood.\n\nHe wasn't saying that people shouldn't have political ideas\n\nor that they shouldn't form groups\n\nto try and get things done.\n\nWhat he was saying is that when we form political parties,\n\nwe often identify as a Democrat or a Republican first\n\nand as American second, and that was really pernicious\n\nto the long-term health of the nation.\n\nInstead, he wanted people to remember\n\nthat they had more in common than what separated them\n\nand political parties tended to exacerbate\n\nthose differences.\n\nTalksexwithsue asks, Did George Washington\n\ndeal with any infectious diseases\n\nlike we see today during his presidency?\n\nYes, he did.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War,\n\nGeorge Washington had the Continental army\n\ninoculated against smallpox, and then during his presidency\n\nthere were several outbreaks of yellow fever\n\nin Philadelphia, and New York, and other coastal cities.\n\nAt the time, there was really a sense that disease outbreak\n\nlike this one was not a responsibility\n\nof the federal government.\n\nIt was a local or state issue.\n\nSo a lot of times the governors would issue quarantines\n\nto try and limit the spread of the disease,\n\nbut Washington and a lot of the other federal officials\n\nwould leave the city to avoid contamination\n\nand did not have any role to play in suppressing it.\n\nnephiguymom asks, I wonder how it would be\n\nif it was required that the vice\n\nbe from the opposite political party of the president?\n\nWell, we've actually had this happen once before.\n\nThomas Jefferson was the second vice president.\n\nHe was the vice president for President John Adams.\n\nThey were from the opposite political party\n\nand it was a disaster.\n\nJefferson actually came remarkably close\n\nto committing treason when he met with the French minister\n\nand encouraged France to continue its attacks\n\non American shipping and encouraged France\n\nto avoid any sort of diplomacy with John Adams\n\nbecause he felt that he would win the next election\n\nand he would offer them a better deal.\n\njpmoonv1 asks, Has any US president ever been fluent\n\nin a second language?\n\nYes, they have.\n\nThomas Jefferson and John Adams both spoke French.\n\nThey learned several other languages,\n\nespecially reading and writing.\n\nPerhaps the most fluent was John Quincy Adams,\n\nwho by the age of 12, spoke almost five languages\n\nand served as his father's secretary\n\nwhen John Adams went to Europe as a diplomat.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams continued to teach himself new languages\n\nthroughout the course of his life.\n\nSome of the more recent presidents\n\nhave less facility with language, though there are some\n\nwho have tried to learn some phrases\n\nto be able to meet with foreign leaders.\n\nAnd for example, George W. Bush did speak Spanish.\n\nBossman13156 asks, What was the greatest\n\nor most impactful speech in the history\n\nof the United States?\n\nWell, I think that has to be\n\nprobably FDR's Four Freedom speech in which he argued\n\nthat in order for the United States to survive\n\nas a democracy and take care of the American people,\n\nit had to provide for freedom of speech and expression,\n\nfreedom of worship, freedom from want,\n\nwhich basically means freedom from hunger or poverty,\n\nand freedom from fear because fear caused people\n\nto pursue things like authoritarian governments.\n\nAnd the speech was really important\n\nbecause it was done in the context\n\nof the looming World War II.\n\nIt was inspiring to people\n\nwho had to understand why they had to fight for democracy\n\nat a time when it didn't always seem like it was working.\n\nGySgtUSMC2 asks, Who do you think was the most influential\n\nfirst lady?\n\nI think that's probably Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt served as FDR's eyes and ears\n\nbecause he couldn't necessarily travel\n\ndue to having to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.\n\nSo she would travel around the country,\n\nshe would meet with average Americans\n\nand report back to him what she was seeing.\n\nShe also wrote a newspaper column\n\nand was the first first lady to have press conferences\n\nand she only invited female reporters,\n\nwhich allowed women to actually carve out a space\n\nin the journalism profession for the first time.\n\nBrightclaw431 asks, Did any of the first presidents\n\nhave any realistic chance of nipping slavery in the bud\n\nif they chose to do so?\n\nSo this is a really interesting question.\n\n12 of the early American presidents\n\nowned enslaved individuals,\n\nbut they didn't necessarily all feel the same way.\n\nPresident George Washington emancipated the individuals\n\nthat he owned when he died.\n\nAnd some of the other presidents like John Quincy Adams,\n\nwhile he didn't necessarily speak out\n\nwhile he was president,\n\nafterwards, he became a member of Congress\n\nand he regularly spoke out against slavery\n\nand the power of slavery in the South.\n\nPlainsViewer asks, How many presidents have died\n\nwhile in office?\n\nEight presidents died in office, four were assassinated,\n\nand four died of natural causes.\n\nWhich is actually pretty surprising\n\nbecause we've only had 45 men serve,\n\nwhich means just under 18% have died\n\nwhile they were president.\n\n_kierk asks, What the hell does the vice president do?\n\nThe vice president has two responsibilities.\n\nOne, they are to cast a tie-breaking vote\n\nif the Senate is divided on a piece of legislation.\n\nSecond is to have a pulse, to be a living replacement\n\nto take over the office of the presidency\n\nif he dies in office.\n\nFor the modern vice president,\n\nthat is still their primary constitutional responsibility,\n\nbut depending on their relationship with the president,\n\nsometimes they are also tasked with other responsibilities.\n\nFor example, Joe Biden was tasked\n\nwith overseeing the recovery\n\nafter the 2008 economic collapse.\n\nAnd more recently, Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nwas given the responsibility of the relationship\n\nwith the nations that primarily lead to immigration\n\nto the United States from the southern border.\n\nEverything else is really up to the president,\n\nand most vice presidents have been totally irrelevant\n\nin history.\n\nstirfried_WEISS asks, What did Ulysses S. Grant do\n\nto deserve being placed on a $50 bill?\n\nWell, Ulysses S. Grant did two really important things.\n\nFirst, he was the victorious general in the Civil War\n\nwhen the Union Army defeated the Confederate Army.\n\nSo winning the Civil War is a pretty big deal.\n\nSecond, as president, I think he's really underappreciated.\n\nHe worked really hard\n\nto try and bring the union back together\n\nafter the Civil War.\n\nHe worked hard to defend the civil rights\n\nand suffrage of recently emancipated African Americans,\n\nand he defended their rights and their liberties\n\nagainst violence from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nSo I think he generally deserves a lot more credit\n\nthan he gets.\n\nSine_Fine_Beli asks, Does Donald Trump\n\nhave unlimited authority to impose tariffs?\n\nWell, first of all, a tariff is basically a tax\n\nthat the United States imposes on an item\n\nthat is coming in from a foreign nation.\n\nNow, most people think that the foreign nation pays the tax\n\nand that's the end of it.\n\nBut what happens is the foreign nation\n\nactually increases the prices, and so that item\n\nthat is coming in is then more expensive for Americans\n\nhere in the United States.\n\nThe president does have broad power to put tariffs on items\n\nor on things coming in from foreign nations.\n\nHowever, Congress can check that power\n\nif it then rejects a tariff through legislation.\n\nBut this is a really interesting part\n\nof the President's responsibilities.\n\nWhile the president does have a lot of power over tariffs,\n\ntheir control over the economy is much more limited\n\nthan people typically think.\n\nFor example, Congress is the one that passes the budget.\n\nCongress is the one that raises funds.\n\nSo if you're concerned about the deficit,\n\nthat is a Congress question.\n\nInflation is even more complicated.\n\nInflation is affected by things like supply chains,\n\nconditions around the world, access to goods,\n\nhow much people want them,\n\nand while the President can take steps\n\nto try and ameliorate that inflation,\n\nthey don't have power to reduce it.\n\nAdditionally, things like interest rates\n\nare controlled by the Federal Reserve,\n\nand the Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent\n\nfrom politics.\n\nSo while the president can make a request,\n\nit's really up to them to change any sort of rate\n\nor make any sort of cut.\n\ndandinohill asks, When President Trump takes office\n\nin January, he will be the second\n\nto own two presidential numbers, 45 and 47.\n\nWho was the first president to do so?\n\n22 and 24.\n\nNo checking or cheating.\n\nThat would be Grover Cleveland.\n\nIn 1884, Grover Cleveland won his first election.\n\nHe was then defeated four years later.\n\nIn 1892, he came back and he defeated Benjamin Harrison\n\nand won his second term.\n\nA lot of the same concerns that voters had in 1888 and 1892.\n\nThings like immigration, tariffs, and the economy\n\nare issues that we are seeing today.\n\ngoodtobehuman asks, What is the deal with George Washington\n\nand the cherry tree?\n\nGeorge Washington did have cherry trees on his estate\n\nat Mount Vernon, and in fact,\n\nrecently we uncovered a discovery of preserved bottles\n\nthat had cherries in them.\n\nThe story with George Washington and the cherry tree\n\nis that when he was a young boy, he cut down a cherry tree\n\nand then when his father asked him about it,\n\nhe said, I cannot tell a lie and admitted to doing so,\n\nbut there is no truth or evidence that suggests\n\nthat he cut down a cherry tree when he was a child.\n\nThis is a myth that was made up by a man named Parson Weems\n\nor Mason Locke Weems.\n\nAnd he wrote a book about Washington\n\nshortly after Washington's death that was frankly filled\n\nwith a whole lot of garbage, but it suited him\n\nbecause he was trying to tell a story\n\nabout Washington's character and the national mythology,\n\nand it sold really, really well.\n\nalexalaurenxo asks, We're talking about\n\nthe Great Depression, and Anthony Moscato goes,\n\n'Where did all the presidents live\n\nbefore the White House was built?'\n\nLOL\n\nGeorge Washington lived in several different houses.\n\nHe lived in two different residences in New York City,\n\nwhich is where the seat of the federal government was\n\nfor about a year when he was first president.\n\nThe seat of government then moved to Philadelphia\n\nand he rented a house,\n\nwhich became known as The President's House,\n\nand he lived there until he retired in 1797.\n\nJohn Adams, the second president of the United States,\n\nlived there until November 1800.\n\nThen he moved to Washington DC\n\nwith the rest of the federal government\n\nand became the first president to live in the White House.\n\nEvery president since has done so\n\nwith the exception of James Madison\n\nonce the White House burned down in the War of 1812,\n\nand he moved just down the street to the Octagon House\n\nuntil it was completed.\n\nAnd Harry Truman also moved across the street\n\ninto the Blair House when there was a massive renovation\n\nof the White House during his term.\n\nhewhatwhat asks, How much blame could we actually give\n\nto Herbert Hoover for the Great Depression?\n\nIt definitely wasn't Herbert Hoover's fault\n\nthat the economy collapsed.\n\nThere were a lot of structural weaknesses and impediments\n\nin the way of a strong economy.\n\nThere was a big bubble that had collapsed once it was clear\n\nthat the speculation was not sustainable.\n\nWhere Hoover did receive a lot of blame\n\nwas his lackluster response.\n\nHe believed that the economy would right itself\n\nand capitalism could be trusted to take over,\n\nand he didn't do much to try\n\nand take care of the American people\n\nwhen they were really suffering.\n\nSo I think he could definitely be blamed\n\nfor not doing enough to try and fix the Great Depression.\n\nHistoryinBrief asks, So was Edith Wilson\n\nthe actual president for a year\n\nwhile Woodrow was recovering from a stroke?\n\n#EdithWilson1stWomanPresident.\n\nWell, she certainly didn't have the official title\n\nor the official office, but yeah,\n\nI think Edith Wilson was primarily acting as\n\nfor most of the time that Wilson was incapacitated.\n\nShe determined who came in to see him,\n\nwho got to talk to him.\n\nShe would report back his decisions at a time when we know\n\nthat he wasn't really able to speak\n\nand were not really sure he understood what was happening.\n\nSo she had enormous authority that was not elected\n\nor was given to her by the Constitution.\n\nWhat's most important about this\n\nis that most people didn't really know what was happening.\n\nThe cabinet had a sense that Wilson was far more ill\n\nthan people realized, but most people were not permitted\n\nto actually see the president,\n\nand so most Americans did not know\n\nwho was actually in charge.\n\nmai_tai_ty_tie asks Alexa,\n\nwhat presidents have been impeached?\n\nWell, there have been four impeachments in US history.\n\nThe first, Andrew Johnson, was impeached\n\nfor trying to remove cabinet secretaries,\n\nwhich violated the Tenure of Office Act.\n\nBill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath.\n\nAnd Donald Trump was impeached twice.\n\nFirst, for withholding funds from Ukraine\n\nfor political purposes.\n\nAnd then for his role in the January 6th insurrection.\n\nNo president has been removed from office.\n\nSouthBayBoy8 asks, There haven't been two presidents\n\nin a row of the same party since Reagan and H. W. Bush.\n\nWhy do you think this is?\n\nWell, I think the American people get frustrated\n\nwith a party.\n\nThey have relatively little patience\n\nand frankly, sometimes short attention spans,\n\nand so they want to elect something new.\n\nThat hasn't always been the case.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, of course,\n\nwon four elections in a row.\n\nAnd then Harry Truman won an election in his own right\n\nand he was from the same party.\n\nchopstickfury01 asks, Which\n\nwould you have the hardest time beating\n\nin a drinking contest?\n\nThat would have to be James Buchanan.\n\nJames Buchanan was known for being able to put down\n\nquite a number of bottles of liquor and not even show it.\n\nSo he would definitely drink me under the table.\n\nCratesofNutella asks, Just how much security\n\ndo past presidents get and how extensive is it?\n\nPast presidents get Secret Service protection,\n\nas do their spouses, and this was required\n\nby a law passed in 1965 after Kennedy's assassination,\n\nwhich recognized that both presidents and former presidents\n\noften receive threats and need additional protection.\n\nThe early presidents had no protection.\n\nThere were no gates outside the president's house,\n\nand there was no Secret Service.\n\nSecret Service didn't start protecting the\n\nuntil 1901.\n\nSo while some presidents like Abraham Lincoln\n\noccasionally had a military guard,\n\nit wasn't guaranteed by Congress.\n\nFormer presidents didn't start getting protection until 1965\n\nwhen Congress passed legislation\n\nensuring that presidents and first ladies\n\nreceive protection for the rest of their lives.\n\nRomanuva asks, Do Presidents age faster in office?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHave you seen the pictures?\n\nPresidents go gray so fast while in office\n\nbecause the demands of the job are so intense,\n\nthere are no easy decisions or choices\n\nthat come to their desk.\n\nThe working hours are often quite intense\n\nand you can really see the impact of stress on their face.\n\nA Reddit user asks, How has the office\n\nof the President of the United States changed over time?\n\nWell, in some ways, the office of the presidency\n\nreally hasn't changed at all.\n\nGeorge Washington established a presidency\n\nthat was the primary actor when it came to foreign policy\n\nand domestic crises and really carved out enormous powers\n\nin jurisdiction for himself and his successors.\n\nIn other ways, the executive branch has really expanded.\n\nWe have far more executive departments,\n\ntheir responsibilities are much greater,\n\nand the number of employees in them is so far beyond\n\nwhat could have been imagined in the 1790s.\n\nSo the scope of the federal government is much bigger,\n\neven if the idea of the president is the same.\n\nradiogirlkaren asks, Yep,\n\nAbe Lincoln was the tallest US president,\n\nbut who was the shortest?\n\nNo political comments necessary.\n\nTesting your presidential smarts.\n\nWell, that would probably be James Madison.\n\nJames Madison was either 5'2 or 5'3 depending on reports,\n\nand he was pretty frail as well.\n\nWhat's interesting is his wife,\n\nDolly Madison was probably 5'8 or 5'9,\n\nand she would wear these giant turbans\n\nto really accentuate her height.\n\nBarryGSexy asks, I wonder how many presidents\n\nkilled another human being\n\nand do we suppose any did so outside of the army?\n\nAndrew Jackson probably killed someone in duel, yeah?\n\nYou are right.\n\nIn May of 1806, Andrew Jackson killed Charles Dickinson\n\nover a dispute over a horse that Jackson owned.\n\nJackson was also wounded in the chest, but he survived.\n\nAnd this dual was later used against him\n\nin presidential elections, arguing that he was blood-hungry\n\nand he was eager to kill people.\n\nDrDigiPol asks, Trivia question,\n\nhow many US presidents have been arrested?\n\nBonus, name them.\n\nDuring the presidency, just one, Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nUlysses S. Grant was arrested while\n\nfor speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nin his horse and carriage,\n\nand he had been warned repeatedly by police\n\nthat he was going to fast, but he couldn't help himself\n\nand he really loved a fast ride.\n\ntylersyck asks, Who do you guys think\n\nwas the most stylish president of the 20th century?\n\nWell, Barack Obama got a lot of flack for his tan suit,\n\nbut I personally thought it looked great.\n\nOther presidents that were known for being quite debonair\n\ninclude John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan as well.\n\nifightpossums asks, What presidents had unusual interests\n\nor hobbies?\n\nFDR was an avid stamp collector\n\nand his stamp collection is still available\n\nat his presidential library.\n\ncal_lovr asks, How much do presidents get paid?\n\nCurrently, Presidents make $400,000 a year.\n\nOriginally, the salary was for $25,000,\n\nwhich was a huge amount of money in 1789\n\nwhen George Washington became president.\n\nBut that money had to cover rent for the president's house,\n\nlabor, food, all expenses related to travel,\n\nand anytime they hosted.\n\nSo it actually went really quickly.\n\nAnd most presidents in the early Republic\n\nleft office in debt.\n\nHumble-Translator466 asks,\n\nWhich president was the best practical joker?\n\nThis has to be Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nJohnson loved to play jokes on people,\n\nand in fact, he even had a car\n\nthat could work in the water as a boat.\n\nAnd so he would drive around guests on his farm in Texas\n\nand he would go too fast down a hill\n\nand cause them to think that they were gonna run\n\ninto the water and then the car would sink\n\nand instead, it would float\n\nand it would start puttering around like any other boat.\n\nHe always got a good laugh\n\nand he really loved their reactions.\n\ndatboyChicas asks, Quick somebody,\n\nwhy did President Truman decide to use atomic weapons\n\nduring World War II?\n\nThis was a decision that President Truman agonized over\n\nbecause he understood the repercussions\n\nand the scale of the death and damage\n\nthat was going to be done to the Japanese people.\n\nBut he believed that in doing so,\n\nhe was actually saving American lives.\n\nHis generals and his advisors had given him estimates\n\nfor how much it would cost\n\nand how many lives would be sacrificed\n\nto try and take additional Japanese territory.\n\nAnd he believed that in doing so,\n\nhe would end the war as quickly as possible.\n\nRealMrParamount asks, So what does Commander in Chief mean\n\nas defined in the Constitution\n\nof the United States of America?\n\nAnyone?\n\nAs the Constitution originally defines it,\n\nthe Commander in Chief is the person that is in charge\n\nof the armed forces of the United States.\n\nSo as president, they get to determine the officers,\n\nthey can appoint people,\n\nbut Congress is responsible for passing legislation\n\nthat determines the rules and regulations\n\nthat manage the Army, Navy, and other armed forces.\n\nRemoveDifferent3357 asks, Do you believe Polk's war\n\nwith Mexico was justified\n\nand should we view the war as a positive\n\nor a negative of his legacy?\n\nPolk's legacy is really interesting\n\nbecause he was generally viewed\n\nas actually one of the most effective presidents.\n\nHe came into office saying he wanted to accomplish\n\na couple of things, including annexing Texas\n\nand getting more territory in the Northwest.\n\nAnd he did those things and then he left after one-term.\n\nSo in terms of promises made, promises kept,\n\nhe is certainly up there.\n\nHowever, the war with Mexico was very much ginned up\n\nto try and seize additional territory,\n\nand in doing so, it killed a lot of innocent people,\n\nit displaced thousands of native Mexicans,\n\nand it led to the expansion of slavery in the American West,\n\nwhich was a major trigger that led to the Civil War.\n\nmyvotedoesn'tmatter asks, Who's your choice\n\nfor the best president on foreign policy?\n\nIt's really hard to choose best and worst\n\nbecause there are so many options.\n\nBut one of the most effective presidents on foreign policy\n\nwas George H. W. Bush, who oversaw the end of the Cold War\n\nin a peaceful way.\n\nThere were no nuclear explosions,\n\nthere was no World War III,\n\nand he did so exercising restraint and humility.\n\nHe didn't gloat and he really could have,\n\nbut he was only a one-term president.\n\nThe thing is, the American people very rarely vote\n\non foreign policy, and we tend not to reward people for wars\n\nthat don't happen or for avoiding conflict.\n\nWe do reward presidents when they win wars,\n\nand since George H. W. Bush didn't do that,\n\nhis contributions are often not as remembered\n\nas they should be.\n\nshu-ha-ri asks,\n\nWhy did Martha Washington burn George's letters?\n\nWell, it's 'cause he asked her to.\n\nJust like most people,\n\nthose letters probably contained all the snarkiness,\n\nand the humor, and the love, and the really intimate stuff\n\nthat we tend to share with our loved ones.\n\nThat's not how he wanted to be remembered.\n\nInstead, he wanted to be remembered\n\nas a little bit more aloof, a little bit more reserved,\n\nthe image he had crafted.\n\nKind of like a marble bust just like this one.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something.\n\nUntil next time.\n\n[upbeat music]",

Yeah.\n\nRFK Jr. has spread the myth that vaccines are linked\n\nto autism for several decades\n\nand it's a central feature of his organization,\n\nChildren's Health Defense.\n\nThat organization made over $23 million\n\nin 2022 alone.\n\nAnd in fact, recent investigative journalism has revealed\n\nthat RFK Jr. himself was being paid\n\nover $20,000 a week as the chairman\n\nfor Children's Health Defense in 2023 alone.\n\nThe purported link to autism and vaccines has been debunked\n\nand addressed over 20 plus years,\n\nand there is no relationship.\n\nThe biggest predictor\n\nfor autism is having an immediate family member also\n\nwith autism, which suggests\n\nthat there's a strong genetic link.\n\nThe prevalence of autism has increased,\n\nbut this is a function of diagnosis.\n\nWe have better, more appropriate diagnostic criteria\n\nto recognize autism cases, whereas in decades past,\n\nwe were not capturing\n\nand recognizing how prevalent autism truly was.\n\n@liza777777 wants to know,\n\nAre GMOs / Synthetic foods / vaccines harmful?\n\nThere's a common perception that GMOs,\n\nespecially food crops are some unnatural thing\n\nthat we've altered in a way that's harmful.\n\nBut the reality is,\n\nis that humans have been genetically modifying\n\nand messing with nature since the dawn of time.\n\nMost people don't know that the vegetables we know\n\nto be cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi,\n\nand cabbage are actually all genetically modified versions\n\nof the wild mustard plant.\n\nThey're the same species.\n\nModern day GMOs allow us to do this in a faster\n\nand more controlled way.\n\n@chefbai_ says, Dove has the best smelling deodorant.\n\nBring on the aluminum & cancer causing parabens\n\nbecause that shit smell good af.\n\nSo the good news is,\n\nis that aluminum salt in antiperspirants\n\nand parabens don't cause cancer,\n\nso you can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nParabens are a class of antimicrobials\n\nand they're used to inhibit contamination\n\nand inhibit the growth of bacteria\n\nand fungi that would contaminate a product\n\nthat you're using repeatedly.\n\nAnd they've been used in these products\n\nfor over a hundred years.\n\nThe levels at which you would be exposed\n\nto parabens are not posing any sort of harm.\n\nIt's why they've been asserted\n\nand reasserted as safe for use.\n\nPeople have been led to believe\n\nthat parabens are linked to breast cancer\n\nbecause there was a really terribly done study\n\nin the Journal of Applied Toxicology\n\nwhere they took breast tumor biopsies\n\nthat were stored in the freezer\n\nand they detected minuscule levels.\n\nWe're talking parts per billion\n\nof parabens in these breast tumor tissues.\n\nAnd when they looked at their negative controls,\n\ntheir blank values, levels of parabens detected\n\nin those were actually higher than some\n\nof the tissue samples, which actually suggests\n\nthat their instrumentation was contaminated.\n\nSo over here we have four different types of parabens,\n\nethylparaben and methylparaben bind 100,000 times\n\nmore weekly to estrogen receptors.\n\nSo one versus a hundred thousand\n\nof your actual estrogen hormone estradiol\n\nand butylparaben and propylparaben bind 10,000 times\n\nmore weekly, so 10 versus 100,000\n\nversus your estradiol hormone.\n\nSo the likelihood of these paraben chemicals\n\nactually outcompeting your estrogen hormones is near zero.\n\n@RoboSox_ wants to know, Are probiotics BS or nah?\n\nUnfortunately, they're more BS than they are, evidence.\n\nProbiotics are a type of supplement\n\nthat contain live microorganisms,\n\nbut there's 40 trillion bacteria\n\nthat live in your GI tracts\n\nand they make up hundreds of different species.\n\nThe problem with probiotic supplements is they usually\n\nonly contain one, two or a small handful\n\nof species of bacteria.\n\nThe reason that they're in the probiotic supplement is not\n\nbecause they've been identified to be beneficial\n\nfor your health, but they're relatively easy\n\nto grow in large quantities\n\nand so they end up in your supplement.\n\nBut there've been a lot of studies that have evaluated\n\nor assessed the ability of probiotic supplements\n\nto improve health,\n\nand unfortunately, there's really no data\n\nto support their use.\n\nThe stomach is very acidic\n\nand if a probiotic supplement doesn't have\n\nwhat we call an enteric coating,\n\nthose bacteria are very likely going\n\nto be killed by your stomach acids.\n\nSo there's no data to even show\n\nthat these supplements are even gonna make it\n\ninto your intestines where they need to be.\n\nPrebiotic is another term that we often confuse\n\nwith probiotics, but prebiotic is really\n\njust a fancy word for fiber.\n\nSo prebiotics are the food\n\nthat the bacteria in your gut are going to use\n\nto do what they do.\n\nWhile you might see supplements\n\nthat say they're filled with prebiotics,\n\nit's really just saying they're containing different types\n\nof fiber, and so you can get a lot of those health benefits\n\nthat we know we need from fiber just\n\nby eating some fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n@wordsmatter wants to know,\n\nWhich pseudoscience has done the most harm?\n\nI would have to say anti-vaccine misinformation.\n\nIt leads to the increased spread of infectious diseases,\n\nwhich means that we have increased amounts of morbidity,\n\nillness, and mortality death among populations\n\nwhere those illnesses and deaths are preventable.\n\nFor example, anti-vaccine misinformation\n\nabout the measles mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThe MMR vaccine led to a spread and outbreak\n\nin Samoa in 2019 that caused the death of 82 people.\n\nPrimarily children under five.\n\nVaccines are estimated to have saved over 150 million lives\n\nin the last several decades.\n\nThey truly are one of the miracles of modern medicine.\n\n@Reimerville wants to know,\n\nMy doctor advised against ozone therapy,\n\nis it helping people?\n\nNo, it is not helping people.\n\nOzone chemically called O3 is a type of oxygen compound\n\nthat makes up parts of our atmosphere.\n\nProponents of ozone therapy claim\n\nthat it has a variety of health benefits.\n\nThey inhale it, they use it in enema form\n\nand in some cases they will actually infuse it\n\nthrough a transfusion of your blood.\n\nOzone has zero therapeutic benefits\n\nand can be potentially very harmful,\n\nespecially if inhaled at very low doses.\n\nYour doctor's absolutely right there is zero reason\n\nfor you to expose yourself to ozone.\n\n@LoganHentz says, You don't detox from sweating.\n\nYou sweat water and salt not [beeps] toxins.\n\nDoesn't make sense for said toxins to just dry\n\non your skin does it?\n\nAbsolutely. Sweating is for temperature regulation.\n\nWhen you sweat, you secrete fluids, water,\n\nand some salts, and when that dries,\n\nit leads to a phenomenon called evaporative cooling,\n\nwhich means that your body now cools down as a result\n\nof taking that energy away.\n\nThe way that your body gets rid of toxins is\n\nthrough your excretory organs, so your lungs, your liver,\n\nyour GI tract, and your kidneys.\n\nThose organ systems are working all the time\n\nto remove any toxins or any substances\n\nthat your body just no longer needs anymore.\n\nPeople like to tout saunas as a method to detox,\n\nbut this is basically like accelerating your\n\nsweating process.\n\nA lot of people feel better after a sauna because the heat\n\nand the environment lets them feel more relaxed,\n\nbut it has nothing to do\n\nwith removing toxins from your body.\n\n@milk16478, What the [beeps] is alkaline water bro\n\nyou've been drinking bleach or something?\n\nProponents of alkaline water\n\nand the alkaline diet believe that increasing the pH\n\nof your body or reducing the acidity\n\nof your body can improve health outcomes.\n\nIt can prevent cancer, it can reduce inflammation,\n\nbut the reality is that you can't actually change the pH\n\nof your body.\n\nYour blood pH is very tightly regulated\n\nat around a pH of 7.4,\n\nand if you could change it, it would be life threatening\n\nand we can't change it\n\nbecause we have buffer systems\n\nthat maintain balance in our bodies,\n\nand there have been a lot of studies that have tried\n\nto show a benefit, but there just isn't.\n\nThe same goes for those at home water ionizer equipment\n\nthat you can pay $5,000 for\n\nthat is just adding extra minerals to your water,\n\nwhich is basically what alkaline water is.\n\nSo things like potassium hydroxide,\n\nmagnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.\n\nThese are chemicals that increase the pH of water\n\nto a pH of eight or nine or so on.\n\nThese substances are not offering any health benefits,\n\nand as soon as you drink this alkaline water,\n\nthat higher pH is gonna be neutralized\n\nby the acid in your stomach.\n\n@neesa_ondrea asks, If the moon affects how the tide rolls\n\nin and affects dementia Alzheimer's patients...\n\nThen why can't the stars affect human behavior\n\nand influence certain traits??\n\nThis is a confusion of a phenomenon called sundowning,\n\nwhich is a situation in which dementia patients,\n\nincluding Alzheimer's patients, have worsening symptoms\n\nas the day progresses.\n\nNow, there's a few theories as to why this occurs,\n\nand some of it has to do with just the progression\n\nof the disease itself,\n\nbut also the confusion that these patients are living\n\nwith the irritability grows as the day progresses,\n\nso they may appear to have worse symptoms\n\nas the day goes on, but it has nothing to do\n\nwith the sun setting or the moon cycle.\n\nIt's simply just that's later in the day.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no evidence to suggest that the stars\n\nand astrology has any impact on human traits and behaviors,\n\nand it's a long held arm of pseudoscience.\n\n@jay_snowdon wants to know,\n\nWhy are supplements pretty much unregulated?\n\nYet we strictly test the safety\n\nand efficacy of real medicine.\n\nAh, yeah. You can thank the politicians\n\nand the legislators of our US Congress.\n\nIn 1994 they passed in a bipartisan effort,\n\nthe 1994 Dietarily Supplement Health and Education Act.\n\nMany senators have financial motives\n\nto pass this law,\n\nparticularly Democratic Senator Tom Harkin\n\nand Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.\n\nBoth of them received extensive amounts\n\nof lobbying money from dietary supplement companies\n\nin order to push this legislation through.\n\nWhat this did was it removed the oversight\n\nthat the FDA had on dietary supplements.\n\nAs a result, that industry has grown exponentially\n\nand nearly all supplements on the shelves today lack\n\nevidence to support their use.\n\nSome examples would include a lot of your greens powders,\n\nthings like AG1 and other dietary supplements,\n\nlaming to give you your servings of fruits and vegetables,\n\nbut when actually analyzing the composition of them,\n\noften they don't contain measurable amounts\n\nof those products and worse, many contain substances\n\nthat are not disclosed.\n\n@mojopono wants to know,\n\nIs it true that #sugar in foods 'feeds' #cancer?\n\nThere's no clinical evidence that eating sugar,\n\navoiding sugar or anything related\n\nto sugar has an impact in preventing or curing cancer.\n\nThis misconception stems from the fact that we use a type\n\nof imaging called PET scan.\n\nSo on a CT scan you might detect a structure,\n\nbut on a PET scan we use a radioactive labeled sugar\n\nthat's taken up by your body\n\nand it lights up in regions\n\nwhere cells in your body are metabolizing\n\nthat sugar more quickly\n\nbecause cancer cells do have faster metabolic activity\n\nbecause they're growing very quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, this has been misinterpreted to lead people\n\nto believe that sugar itself is causing cancer\n\nwhen it's just a feature of certain cancer types.\n\nCancer cells will consume glucose at a faster rate\n\nbecause they need to take that glucose\n\nand make new cell components\n\nbecause those tumors are growing very quickly.\n\nSo it's not the sugar that's feeding\n\nor causing cancer, it's a function of\n\nhow cancer cells are using sugar that's available.\n\n@bubblegumonarch says,\n\nI knew receipt paper was thermal activated\n\nbut I didn't know that that coating is like toxic bpa\n\nwhat ??? I handle that [beeps] all day every day.\n\nBPA or bisphenol A is a chemical that's used primarily\n\nto help manufacture plastics.\n\nIn thermal receipt paper it's used as a coating\n\nto facilitate that printing.\n\nThere's a concern\n\nthat this chemical may be implicated in endocrine disruption\n\nor interfering with your hormones.\n\nThere've been some studies that suggest cashiers\n\nor other customer service people who handle lots\n\nof receipts over a working shift may be exposed\n\nto high levels of BPA.\n\nBut that particular study used an estimate value\n\nin a modeling equation that was orders\n\nof magnitude higher than\n\nwhat any other data set would suggest.\n\nSo they're skewing their data to overestimate\n\nhow much BPA someone would be in contact with.\n\nBPA is the same chemical when people express concern\n\nabout microwaving certain types of plastic\n\nand just as is true with the receipt handling,\n\nthe amount of BPA that might be in the food products\n\nthat you microwave is going to be orders\n\nof magnitude lower than what you would actually need\n\nto be exposed to in order to see some sort\n\nof impact on your hormones.\n\nAnd on top of that, BPA is rapidly metabolized by your liver\n\nand excreted so you don't have\n\nto worry about it accumulating in your body.\n\n@BrettNA70273495 asks, Question for you Andrea\n\nif you don't mind?\n\nWhat common household chemical would you say you are\n\ndefinitely worth avoiding?\n\nI know I probably eat too much Teflon\n\nbut still buy non-stick cookware.\n\nFor me personally, there isn't one thing\n\nthat I have in my house\n\nthat I would say I need to get rid of,\n\nbut there are certain considerations.\n\nSay if you live in an older home\n\nand you might have some antiquated plumbing,\n\nyou might wanna get that looked at\n\nto see if there's high levels of things like lead\n\nor if you have an old building\n\nthat maybe has asbestos in the walls or the countertops.\n\nSince you mentioned Teflon, that's an interesting topic\n\nbecause it's gotten a lot of attention in recent months.\n\nTeflon chemically is part of the class\n\nof chemicals called PFAS.\n\nNow PFAS incorporate thousands of different chemicals\n\nand Teflon chemically called PTFE is a very long\n\nchemical and it's very stable.\n\nAnd so the likelihood\n\nof you actually experiencing harm from being exposed\n\nto Teflon by using non-stick cookware is actually very low.\n\nWhen people are stressing about these exposures to chemicals\n\nthat generally don't have a big impact on their health,\n\nwe should be redirecting our focus\n\nto things like healthy lifestyle habits,\n\ngetting good quality sleep, eating a diverse diet,\n\nand staying up to date\n\nwith your preventative health screenings,\n\nwhich really are the things\n\nthat can impact your health.\n\n@UncouthPrimate wants to know,\n\nThere's an emerging trend\n\nof people claiming that sunscreen is more harmful than good.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nLet's clear up a few things.\n\nSo the reason that sun exposure is a risk factor\n\nfor cancer is because there are two main types\n\nof ultraviolet radiation, UVA and UVB\n\nand these ultraviolet radiation energy\n\nessentially penetrates your skin.\n\nThat energy is then transferred to molecules in your cells,\n\nwhich can cause DNA damage and mutations,\n\nand those mutations can ultimately lead\n\nto cancer the more you're exposed to it.\n\nBy taking a sunscreen\n\nand putting some of it on your skin,\n\nthe molecules of chemicals in the sunscreen now absorb\n\nthat energy and convert that to heat.\n\nAs a result, those ultraviolet rays don't get\n\ninto those deeper layers of your skin.\n\nThey're absorbed right by the sunscreen,\n\nand so your cells don't experience the damage.\n\nSo people are saying that chemicals\n\nthat you might find in sunscreens,\n\nparticularly your organic filters\n\nlike avobenzone are causing cancer\n\nand so it's causing more harm than doing good\n\nand preventing sun exposure.\n\nBut these chemicals have been extensively studied\n\nfor safety.\n\nThere's no clinical evidence that they're linked\n\nto cancer in any way.\n\n@daddypinx asks, wait, what do you mean there's arsenic\n\nand lead in tampons in the us?? i hate it here.\n\nThe good news is that this is blown wildly\n\nout of proportion.\n\nSo there was a recent study that went viral\n\nand really, really scared a lot of people,\n\nbut for no good reason.\n\nSo this study took 20 individual tampons\n\nand they took the fabric\n\nand they digested it with high temperatures, 350 Fahrenheit\n\nand an acid extremely concentrated to digest the fabric.\n\nAnd from there they used analytical chemistry equipment\n\nto look at the levels of different trace impurities,\n\narsenic, cadmium, lead, and so on,\n\nand they found very, very small quantities,\n\nwe're talking parts per billion.\n\nAnd for context, one part per billion is equivalent\n\nto one second of time in 31.7 years.\n\nBut I think we can all agree that 350 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nand a pH of one is not the environment of a vagina.\n\nFor context, a vagina is about 99 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nand a pH of 4.5.\n\nSo not only did this study actually show\n\nthat you're going to be exposed to any of this,\n\nbut the levels that they were detecting\n\nin the tampons are orders\n\nof magnitude lower than other things like tea leaves\n\nand water and cannabis.\n\nTampons are made outta cotton and cotton is a plant.\n\nAnd when plants grow in the environment,\n\nthey pick up elements and substances that are in the soil\n\nand in the air and in the water,\n\nand that's where lead, arson, cadmium,\n\nthese are all elements, right?\n\nThey're part of our earth's crust.\n\nSo you don't need to freak out about your tampons\n\nor throw them away,\n\nbut you also have to realize that this is something\n\nthat is universal to all plants,\n\nincluding ones that you eat on a daily basis.\n\n@AlBowers1 asks, Which vaccines contain mercury?\n\nNone of the vaccines contain mercury.\n\nThere's a preservative that's used to prevent contamination\n\nof vaccines with things like bacteria and fungi.\n\nThat is called thimerosal.\n\nAnd thimerosal is a salt\n\nof a different compound called ethylmercury.\n\nNow, ethylmercury is not mercury,\n\nit's a compound that contains a mercury ion.\n\nThis was conflated to suggest\n\nthat vaccines contained mercury.\n\nIt's also further confusing because there's a different type\n\nof a mercury compound called methylmercury.\n\nThat's the one that we're warned about eating too much fish\n\nlike tuna because the methylmercury is found everywhere\n\nand that can accumulate in our bodies.\n\nBut to illustrate this,\n\nI wanna talk about two different types of alcohol.\n\nSo we have rubbing alcohol here, which is isopropyl alcohol,\n\nand we have champagne, which is ethanol.\n\nWe know that ethanol is safe at relatively low doses\n\nand many people enjoy a drink or two,\n\nbut nobody's gonna drink a bottle of rubbing alcohol\n\nbecause we know that that would be toxic.\n\nThe same is true for methylmercury versus ethylmercury.\n\nOne of them can be harmful at a relatively low dose\n\nand the other one can be safe at a relatively low dose.\n\nSo thimerosal was used in several vaccines\n\nto prevent contamination, but thimerosal is not mercury.\n\nHowever, because of misunderstanding\n\nabout this chemical difference,\n\nmost vaccines ended up removing the thimerosal outright.\n\nThe only vaccines in the US\n\nthat even have thimerosal now are multi-dose flu vaccines,\n\nand those account for less than 7%\n\nof all flu vaccines being administered.\n\n@hellohcourtney asks,\n\nAnyone here of any alternative cancer treatments\n\nthat work?\n\nThere's a belief that scientists\n\nand healthcare providers are hiding natural treatments\n\nfor a variety of diseases including cancer.\n\nBut you might be surprised to know\n\nthat we actually often harness nature\n\nand improve upon it using science.\n\nToday we have many different pharmaceuticals\n\nthat target cancer\n\nthat are actually derived from natural chemicals,\n\nand we tweak them to improve their safety,\n\ntheir efficacy, or reduce side effects.\n\nFor example, a chemical called Podophyllotoxin,\n\nnatural chemical derived from the mayapple plant is used\n\nin pharmaceuticals or in medical treatments,\n\nbut we've also altered it chemically\n\nto create a chemical called etoposide.\n\nIt's better able to treat more cancer types\n\nand it has reduced side effects compared\n\nto the natural version.\n\nAnother example would be something like Paclitaxel,\n\na natural chemical from the yew tree,\n\nand we've altered it chemically\n\nto create a compound called docetaxel.\n\nDocetaxel is often used\n\nto treat certain cancers like breast cancer,\n\nprostate cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma,\n\nand certain types of head and neck cancer.\n\nAnd this is not something that's unique\n\nto cancer treatments either.\n\nAspirin, which chemically is called acetylsalicylic acid,\n\nis actually derived from a chemical found in willow bark.\n\nUnfortunately, people who opt for unproven treatments\n\nfor cancer have increased risk of poor outcomes.\n\nWhen you look at breast cancer survival,\n\nbreast cancer patients\n\nthat forego proven treatments have a 5.7 times increased\n\nrisk of death compared to patients\n\nthat use proven treatments.\n\n@JasonQ295178 wants to know,\n\nWhy are cancer rates in young people skyrocketing?\n\nThe good news is cancer rates\n\nin young people are not skyrocketing.\n\nUnfortunately, there've been a lot of headlines\n\nthat have said things to that effect,\n\nbut this really requires context.\n\nMost of the risk factors for cancers are things\n\nthat you actually can't control\n\nand they relate to your genetics,\n\nbut there are some that are impacted\n\nby modifiable risk factors.\n\nAnd so for many of these cancer rates are\n\nactually declining.\n\nWe're also seeing declines in cancer rates\n\nfor lung cancer because of public health measures\n\nand smoking cessation education campaigns.\n\nWe've seen a lot of headlines that have said\n\nthat colorectal cancer is increasing 1% year over year\n\nin people under 50,\n\nbut that is actually not the correct way to look at it.\n\nSo to illustrate this,\n\nthese are the colorectal cancer rates\n\nin the US by age group.\n\nAnd so colorectal cancer is the most common\n\nin older individuals compared to younger individuals,\n\nwhich is the case for nearly all cancers.\n\nCancers are by and large a disease of aging.\n\nSo the rate of cancer,\n\nthese are number of cases per 100,000 people.\n\nIn individuals for age 40 to 49,\n\nthere's a rate of 37 cases per a hundred thousand people.\n\nSo an increase in 1% means we've gone from 37 cases\n\nto 37.37 cases per a hundred thousand people.\n\nAnd when you look at the fact that there are\n\nabout 150,000 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed every year,\n\nthat means that we're seeing a few hundred total more cases\n\nin people under 50.\n\nPreviously, colonoscopy was recommended for individuals 50\n\nand above, but it's actually been reduced\n\nto individuals 45 and above.\n\nSo rates are a function of the ability to detect cancers.\n\nSo if we're screening more people\n\nwithin those younger age groups,\n\nwe're also going to find more cancers.\n\n@HarrisonHSmith says,\n\nWhen you see 'Citric Acid' on an ingredients list,\n\ndid you know that you're eating an extract\n\nof Black Mold patented by Pfizer?\n\nSo this is not true,\n\nbut it underscores misinformation about\n\nhow we manufacture citric acid.\n\nCitric acid is used in foods to give it a sour taste,\n\nso it's used in candies, but it's also used in seasonings\n\nand spices, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, mustard.\n\nIt gives everything that nice little sour flavor.\n\nEvery organism creates citric acid as part\n\nof their basic metabolic process.\n\nThat's why in the cell respiration pathway\n\nwe have the citric acid cycle.\n\nSo we harnessed this fundamental principle of all organisms\n\nand we use a specific species\n\nof fungi called aspergillus niger.\n\nWe grow up mold in really large containers\n\nand we give them molasses,\n\nand as they're metabolizing the molasses,\n\nthey're producing citric acid during the citric acid cycle,\n\nand so we harvest that citric acid from the liquid\n\nthat the mold is growing in and there's no mold in it.\n\nAspergillus niger is technically a black mold\n\nbecause it produces a pigment\n\nthat gives it a black coloring,\n\nbut the color of a mold has no bearing\n\non whether it's a harmful organism or not.\n\nAnd there's lots of black molds that exist,\n\nincluding many that we eat in foods every single day.\n\nTofu or soy sauce or koji.\n\nThese are all produced using black molds.\n\n@AGHuff wants to know, Does chronic Lyme disease exist?\n\nThis is a very controversial topic,\n\nand unfortunately, Lyme disease has actually been plagued\n\nwith controversy since it was first identified in the 1980s.\n\nLyme disease is an acute infection\n\nby bacteria called Borrelia burgdorfer\n\nthat are deposited into your skin through the bite\n\nof certain species of ticks that are infected with it.\n\nSo when you get Lyme disease, you take antibiotics such\n\nas doxycycline, which will eliminate the bacteria\n\nand clear the infection.\n\nThe phrase chronic Lyme disease is used in two contexts.\n\nThe first refers to symptoms\n\nthat may persist in a small proportion of people\n\nafter you finish that antibiotic treatment.\n\nThis is correctly termed post-treatment\n\nLyme disease syndrome,\n\nand it occurs in about three to 5% of people\n\nwith legitimate Lyme disease.\n\nAnd this has to do with the fact\n\nthat the bacteria may have caused some direct tissue damage\n\nand your immune system takes some time to return\n\nto baseline, so you may have some symptoms\n\nfor a period of time.\n\nThis is not unique to Lyme disease either.\n\nNearly every infection that we know of,\n\nthere's a small proportion of people\n\nthat may have lingering symptoms\n\nafter the infection is gone.\n\nContext two refers to a persistent infection\n\nthat is ongoing and is long term.\n\nThere are many organizations\n\nthat promote this unfounded theory,\n\nand what they do is they recommend\n\nand prescribe treatments that have no evidence\n\nand are potentially harmful,\n\nincluding long-term courses of antibiotics.\n\nNow, clinical trials have demonstrated\n\nthat there's no therapeutic benefit\n\nof extending antibiotic treatment\n\nfor this bacterial infection,\n\nyet people still prescribe these\n\nand this can lead to serious consequences like sepsis\n\nand opportunistic infections\n\nbecause you're taking antibiotics for too long.\n\nThey also promote a variety\n\nof unproven wellness interventions,\n\nthings like colloidal silver, bee venom therapy,\n\nurine therapy, enemas, herbal supplements,\n\nhormone treatments, metal chelation,\n\nand a variety of other interventions.\n\nNot only do these things have no evidence to support them\n\nfor any ailment, they certainly don't have evidence\n\nto support them for the treatment of a persistent infection\n\nthat does not exist.\n\nThis is why scientific expert agencies\n\nlike the CDC have revised their phrasing\n\nto discourage the use of the term chronic Lyme disease.\n\n@lods63 wants to know,\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Leaky Gut?\n\nIs it real? If so, what is the best way to address it?\n\nSo leaky gut sometimes called increased intestinal\n\npermeability is a diagnosis that is promoted by a lot\n\nof wellness influencers.\n\nLike all pseudoscience diagnoses has a little bit\n\nof truth behind it.\n\nSo there are certain legitimate gastrointestinal diseases\n\nlike celiac disease\n\nor ulcerative colitis where the pathology\n\nof the disease causes disruptions in\n\nhow your intestines function.\n\nBut wellness influencers have extrapolated that\n\nto tell people that your intestines\n\njust broadly become permeable\n\nand allow undigested food particles, toxins,\n\nand bacteria to get into your bloodstream\n\nand cause a really laundry list of symptoms.\n\nEverything from GI upset to brain fog and hair loss\n\nand weird food cravings.\n\nThere's no evidence to support this diagnosis\n\nand there's no evidence to support any of the tests\n\nand the treatments that these wellness influencers promote.\n\nThis is a hallmark of pseudoscience.\n\nThey create a medical condition that they can sell a test\n\nfor and then they can sell you the treatment for.\n\nDon't fall for it.\n\n@travelingenes says, Hey James Quincy,\n\nAs the CEO of @cocacola, did you allow your own children\n\nto grow up drinking Coca-Cola?\n\nOr is your preference\n\nthat only other people's kids be exposed\n\nto high fructose corn syrup, which is harmful effects\n\non the liver mirroring alcohol consumption?\n\nSo high fructose corn syrup is very poorly understood.\n\nSo what we do is we take the glucose\n\nthat's normally 100% of corn syrup\n\nand we take an enzyme called glucose isomerase\n\nand we convert about 50% of it\n\nto the other simple sugar fructose.\n\nSo now you have in high fructose corn syrup,\n\na mixture of about 50% fructose and 50% glucose.\n\nI bet you didn't know,\n\nbut that ratio of glucose to fructose is almost identical\n\nto the ratio of glucose to fructose in honey\n\nand the ratio of glucose to fructose\n\nin table sugar or cane sugar.\n\nHigh fructose corns syrup is not any worse than honey\n\nor any worse than sucrose or table sugar.\n\nThese are all just sugars.\n\nYour body views them and digests them\n\nand processes them essentially the same way.\n\nYour body needs sugars for optimal function,\n\nbut anything in excess, including sugar,\n\ncan be harmful at a high enough dose.\n\n@je_suis_belle1 asks, Why r people refusing to go\n\nthrough body scanners at the airport cause of radiation?!?\n\nDammit don't u have a cell phone?!!\n\nCell phones use radio frequency radiation\n\nand body scanners\n\nat the airport use millimeter wave radiation.\n\nNow when we're talking about radiation,\n\nradiation it all refers to different types of energy.\n\nThe type of radiation that body scanners\n\nand cell phones use are down in the radio frequency range.\n\nThese types of radiation waves are very long\n\nand have very low energy,\n\nwhich means that they're non-ionizing.\n\nSo when they interact with your body,\n\nthey're not able to actually cause any damage\n\nto your cells or your tissues.\n\nCell phones and body scanners don't contain types\n\nof radiation that are going to cause you harm.\n\nA lot of people confuse\n\nor are scared of the phrase radiation\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation,\n\nhigh energy radiation like gamma radiation\n\nthat can be ionizing.\n\nThese are high energy, they can cause damage,\n\nbut your radio frequency\n\nand your body scan radiation is very low energy.\n\n@suratybal wants to know,\n\nare underwire bra is still suspect as a cause\n\nfor breast cancer?\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nScientific experts have actually never suspected\n\nthat underwires are a cause for breast cancer.\n\nThe logic is that something tight around the lymph nodes\n\nand the breast tissue was leading to toxin accumulation,\n\nwhich was then causing breast cancer.\n\nThere's no scientific plausibility to this\n\nand it ignores basic concepts of physiology\n\nand how compounds and toxins and our lymphatic\n\nand cardiovascular or blood system actually works.\n\nNow, if you don't wanna wear a bra,\n\ndo you but don't omit wearing a bra\n\nbecause you've been told that it causes cancer.\n\n@LoriSmith1962 says, Carnivore diet is healthier\n\nfor humans and better\n\nfor the environment than being a vegan.\n\nSo this is just objectively false.\n\nThe carnivore diet is based on the premise\n\nthat you should only be consuming animal products.\n\nThat includes meat, animal fats and eggs,\n\nand this diet omits food groups\n\nand nutrients that we know are critical\n\nfor health, including fiber.\n\nCarnivore diet is nearly devoid of fiber,\n\nand fiber is essential for proper GI function.\n\nIt's also critical to help regulate levels of blood lipids,\n\nand it's also really important\n\nfor your overall immune system health.\n\nIf you are adhering to a diet that doesn't have fiber\n\nand doesn't have things like fruits\n\nand vegetables, you're running the risk\n\nof severe nutrient deficiency\n\nand adverse health effects,\n\nincluding increased risk of GI issues,\n\ncertain types of cancers and cardiovascular issues.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nRemember, false health information travels six times faster\n\nthan credible facts usually because it's scaring you\n\nand exacerbating your health fears.\n\nWe all can play a role in helping to combat\n\nand fact check health disinformation.\n\nThanks for watching Pseudoscience

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Mark Wood.\n\nI've been doing polar expeditions for over 20 years.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions.\n\nThis is Polar Exploration Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo Adrianjones28 asked,\n\nWhat was the most repulsive thing you had\n\nto eat on your expeditions?\n\nIt was rancid, a whale blubber,\n\nwhich is absolutely repulsive\n\nand just was really tough to chew through as well.\n\nAnd the people who gave it me\n\nwho knew me really well were smiling\n\n'cause they knew it tasted bad.\n\nWhen you chew it, it's like chewing on a car tire,\n\nbut it also stinks.\n\nSo TroyPSimpson asked,\n\nI've no idea why I'm watching videos\n\nabout what to do if I come face to face with a polar bear.\n\nWell, I've come face to face with a polar bear, Troy,\n\nand 300 meters away, right up close to my face.\n\nActually followed me for about three days.\n\nBut the moment that I started\n\nto feel my heart really beat\n\nwas when I actually could smell the bear.\n\nAnd that means the bear's really, really close.\n\nAnd I could hear him sort of grunting.\n\nSo this is the nose of the polar of bear.\n\nI was stood on some ice luckily,\n\nand he jumped up and sniffed my GoPro camera.\n\nTo give it perspective,\n\nhe was an arms distance away.\n\nSo he was this close away from me,\n\nwhich is too close in my world,\n\nand this is kind of what I was looking at.\n\nThe incredible strength within this jaw\n\nto rip an animal open was only at an arm's length away.\n\nIt's the first time that I've actually felt real danger.\n\nAnd you only feel tremendously alone\n\nwhen you feel you need somebody's help.\n\nAnd I had nobody else there.\n\nIt seemed like hours,\n\nbut it was seconds of looking at this bear\n\nand eventually he dropped down and just walked away.\n\nAnd at that point,\n\nI got this pen with the firework on the end\n\nand I pointed it at his feet\n\nand luckily it exploded in front of him,\n\nnot harming the bear,\n\nbut enough to scare him away and he ran off.\n\nBut for about two or three nights,\n\nI was still sticking my head out the tent\n\nlike a mere cat and looking around\n\nand making sure that he'd gone,\n\nand he had definitely gone, which was a massive relief.\n\nSo Seorisgf says,\n\nBro, where is the North Pole?\n\nActually there's five North Poles, let me show you.\n\nSo this is the top of the world and you've got Russia\n\nand you've got Canada and all the countries around.\n\nBut the blue bit in the center is the Arctic ocean.\n\nTo show you where the five North Poles are,\n\nI'm gonna use my trusty polar bear claw.\n\nYou've got the geographic North Pole,\n\nwhich is the very top of the planet where all of the lines\n\nof longitude pass through.\n\nThat's a fixed pole.\n\nThen you've got the pole of inaccessibility,\n\nwhich is on the Arctic Ocean itself.\n\nAgain, a fixed point,\n\nbut it's equidistance from any landmass around it,\n\nfrom Greenland to Canada to Russia, et cetera.\n\nThen you've got three other poles.\n\nOne of them is the Geomagnetic North Pole,\n\nwhich all geophysicists like,\n\nvery difficult word to say.\n\nAnd that's a moving pole.\n\nAnd currently it's going across the Canadian\n\nIsland of Ellesmere.\n\nThen you've got the magnetic North Pole,\n\nwhich I'm sure you've heard of.\n\nAnd that's going across the Canadian ocean side\n\nand it's crossing over to Russia.\n\nSo it's moving and moving over to Russian side.\n\nAnd that's really in the news at the moment\n\nbecause of its shift.\n\nAnd the final pole that you've got\n\nis actually in the air itself.\n\nIt's the point from Polaris to the North Pole,\n\nand it's a celestial pole.\n\nSo that's five North Poles.\n\nSo a great question\n\nor statement from Snakesl1,\n\nThe dudes that were involved in the heroic age\n\nof Arctic exploration were out of their freaking minds.\n\nSo the pioneer age of polar exploration\n\nwere really from the late 1800s onwards,\n\nright up to the point we reached the geographic north\n\nand geographic south poles,\n\nwhich were earlier on in the last century.\n\nAt that time, it was about discovery\n\nand mapping these areas.\n\nIn the days of Sir Ernest Shackleton\n\nand his men doing epic journeys across Antarctica,\n\nas some would say that they risked\n\ntheir lives for discovery,\n\nbut really it was pure survival.\n\nSo they weren't given a choice.\n\nThey went out there to do something\n\nthat no other humans had done before, which was so heroic.\n\nNowadays that wouldn't really happen\n\nbecause the communications we have,\n\nthe global communications, the satellite, et cetera,\n\nwould allow us to show the peril in real time\n\nso we could be rescued.\n\nR_mccallsburg has written,\n\nRead today that the Arctic Explorer has brought lard\n\nwith them since it's so calorific dense.\n\nDid they just eat it or what?\n\nThat's what the explorers used to do.\n\nNowadays we're a little bit more advanced\n\nin understanding nutrition,\n\nand this picture shows little packets of food\n\nthat I've decanted from the original packet.\n\nThere's actually about 100 packets of food\n\nand you've got main meals and also puddings,\n\nand that allows me also to put salami and butter and cheese\n\nand salt and everything else in there.\n\nAnd you wrap it up into a little ball.\n\nInstead of having a big carrier bag full of food each day,\n\nthere's actually two handfuls of food that you have.\n\nAnd inside there is apple and custard powder\n\nand that's what I eat as a pudding.\n\nYou've also got the main meals on this side,\n\nwhich can be a mixture of curries, stews,\n\npastas as well for different packets.\n\nSo you're not eating the same food all the time.\n\nI go and collect the snow or the ice\n\nand I melt it down, then boil it up,\n\nand then I pour this powder into a container\n\nand pour the boiling hot water into the container,\n\nmix it up, and then it expands.\n\nAnd that's what I eat.\n\nFull of protein, full of carbs,\n\nfull of everything you need to perform really well.\n\nAnderson Lemke asks a good question,\n\nWhat kind of cell phones do Arctic explorers use?\n\nWith cell phones, we can't use them\n\nin these extreme cold areas.\n\nWe use satellite phones\n\nand you can't use them as well like normal cell phones\n\nto look at the internet and to connect with friends\n\nor, say, call emergency services.\n\nWe use these to connect directly with the rescue services\n\nthat we've already connected with prior to the expedition.\n\nI can also connect with friends and family,\n\nbut I don't when I'm on extreme expeditions,\n\nand the reason being is it's too emotional for me.\n\nTo bring myself back into their world will drain\n\nmy sort of buildup of non-emotion\n\nthat I've got for the expedition.\n\nIt loses my focus for what I'm doing each day,\n\nwhich is pretty tough mentally.\n\nSo I don't need somebody that I love on the other end\n\nof the phone weakening that spirit, if you like.\n\nSo this is a question from Al Lowe.\n\nWhat's the difference between a North Pole\n\nand the South Pole?\n\nAll of the difference in the world, he says.\n\nSo from an explorer's perspective,\n\nthe Arctic Ocean or the North Pole\n\nis the toughest expedition\n\nthat you can do hands down.\n\nAntarctica itself being a continent,\n\nall you have to deal with is oncoming winds,\n\ntremendous cold, the loneliness of being out there,\n\nand sometimes crevasses,\n\nbut you generally know where the crevasses are.\n\nIn the North, it's like a zoo up there.\n\nThere's a varied amount of animals there.\n\nIf you move to Antarctica in the center\n\naround the South Pole,\n\nthere's no birds or anything like that.\n\nIt's just silence.\n\nSo Sara Bushway asks, Watching season seven of Alone.\n\nThey have to survive 100 days in the Arctic by themselves\n\nto win a million dollars.\n\nCould you do it?\n\nI'd love to win a million dollars with what I do.\n\nFor me personally, I work alone a lot.\n\nSo I'm known for solo work, working Antarctica,\n\nthe Arctic Circle, also on training expeditions as well.\n\nSo I've spent 50 days in Antarctica alone,\n\n30 days around the North Pole,\n\nanother 30 days in Norwegian High Arctic.\n\nGenerally I'm okay being alone.\n\nAnd the biggest is issue there is the mental status\n\nand strength that you require to do that.\n\nAnd I think experience gives you\n\nthe abilities to carry that out.\n\nAnd as you're going through a blank landscape,\n\nit gives you tremendous creativity in your mind\n\nto think about yourself as a human being,\n\nbut what direction you want to go in, in life as well.\n\nSo Be_the_spark has asked a serious question.\n\nOther than reindeer and the occasional polar bear,\n\nwhat kind of animals would live in Santa's North Pole?\n\nYou've got Arctic fox, Arctic hares,\n\nwhich are small animals.\n\nObviously you've also got caribou, which is a reindeer.\n\nAnd you've got mascot\n\nwhich are quite big animals, pack animals.\n\nAnd also you've got lemmings, very, very small.\n\nAnd the only real bird I can think of\n\nwould be the Arctic tern,\n\nwhich is in fact the longest migrating bird on the planet\n\nand can also be found in Antarctica as well.\n\nSo it goes all the way around the planet.\n\nIt's very rare,\n\nbut sometimes you do get interaction with these animals.\n\nSo AndyC_1 asks,\n\nWhich polar explorer do you have\n\nthe most admiration for and why?\n\nSo two big explorers,\n\nSir Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott\n\ndid epic expeditions in Antarctica,\n\nbut there was one person who has actually worked with them\n\nas like shadow of these two men.\n\nAnd it's an Irishman called Tom Crean\n\nand he was the workforce behind them\n\nand is known as the Unsung Hero of that age.\n\nSo it was in Tom Crean's nature to survive,\n\nbut also to look after the people he was with.\n\nSo he put his life in danger\n\nby actually rescuing his men, looking after Shackleton,\n\nbeing the forefront or the energy\n\nbehind making that expedition\n\nto the South Pole a success as in all the men survived.\n\nRudi Schuller asks,\n\nWhat do negative degree temperatures feel like?\n\nTo stand alone in minus 40, minus 50\n\nis a real tenseness on your body, almost claustrophobic,\n\nthat you can't get out of the situation.\n\nIt's a real horrible feeling\n\nthat you are engulfed in the cold.\n\nBut to survive in that moment, you need to do three things.\n\nOne is you need to make sure your body core\n\ntemperature is warm.\n\nSo by eating food is a real survival technique\n\nto warm yourself up from the inside.\n\nThe second thing is to wear the correct clothing.\n\nAnd that's something that will help you keep warm,\n\nbut also allow your body to breathe as you're moving\n\nso you don't create sweat on your body,\n\n'cause if you create sweat, then when you stop,\n\nthat will turn to ice or clinging onto your heart\n\nand your lungs and can give you hypothermia.\n\nAnd then the third thing is movement.\n\nSo as long as you can move, keep moving,\n\nkeep the blood blowing\n\naround the body away from the extremities\n\nso you don't get frostbite,\n\nthen your body can function and you can progress.\n\nSo inside the tent itself at night,\n\nit's the same temperature as outside the tent.\n\nYou've got a little protection from the wind, which is good,\n\nbut you can be minus 35 with inside the tent,\n\nwhich is colder than your freezers at home.\n\nBut any explorer, any adventurer that you ever meet\n\nand you say the sound of the cooker is...\n\nAs soon as you start hearing that sound,\n\nyour brain starts getting happy\n\nbecause your body starts warming up.\n\nAnd it's amazing to feel\n\nthat initial heat coming off the cooker\n\nwhere you start stripping your clothes down\n\nand you can actually be in base layers inside your tent\n\nas a tent heats up.\n\nSo MaidenSlate asks,\n\nCurious, how would you envision medical care\n\nin remote and rural areas?\n\nAnd I am self-sufficient, so I need to, first of all,\n\nbe trained in medical care myself.\n\nIn Antarctica, as I started to move towards\n\nthe South Pole over 50 days,\n\nI had a problem with my boot.\n\nIt wasn't fitting very well with my skis,\n\nso I had a little bit of movement inside with my foot.\n\nAnd over a few days, it started to heat up\n\nand one day I took my foot out\n\nand I found that the base of my foot, the skin had come off,\n\na massive amount of skin had come off\n\nand you just had the rawness of the skin underneath.\n\nAnd I was in a lot of agony.\n\nSo what I did at night was I cut the skin off\n\nand because skin's got protein in it,\n\nI ate the skin.\n\nI didn't eat the skin.\n\nThat's a joke by the way.\n\nI took the skin off.\n\nAfter a few days, it actually dried off\n\nbecause Antarctica is a dry desert.\n\nIf you expose the foot to the dryness,\n\nit dries really, really quickly.\n\nSo the environment actually saved the day for me.\n\nSo this is from originalHRN.\n\nI think I need a career change.\n\nI wonder how one becomes an Arctic explorer?\n\nI think you just need to find where your passion lies\n\nand what you want to do and just take steps from there.\n\nThe word explorer is quite a contentious word\n\nin this modern era.\n\nI've been asked whether I can actually call myself that.\n\nWell, after 35 plus expeditions in the polar regions,\n\nI feel I have a right to say that.\n\nAnd also it excites children when I come into schools\n\nto give talks that they know\n\nthat have got an explorer coming in.\n\nReally the explorers that I recognize,\n\nthese guys in the past,\n\nthe pioneers who discovered areas on the planet,\n\nand in space, they are the pioneer explorers of the past.\n\nThe key point is you've got to have the desire\n\nto go out there because the environment is so claustrophobic\n\nand unpredictable that you've got to have the real need\n\nto go out there and operate.\n\nSo you've got to consider that to begin with.\n\nSo my suggestion would be to go out\n\nand experience the environment to begin with\n\nand then to decide how you want to operate out there.\n\nLimelacowboy, I love polar exploration\n\nbecause where else are you going to find\n\nthis many people excited to discover a guy\n\nwho got cannibalized 180 years ago.\n\nThat's a good statement.\n\nAnd yeah, people are excited about\n\nthe mac carb, aren't they?\n\nA 100 or so years ago in the days of Sir John Franklin\n\nand his men who perished along the Northwest Passage\n\nin High Arctic Canada weren't discovered\n\nuntil recent times as ships were,\n\nbut all of the men died on ice.\n\nThere was talks of cannibalism as well,\n\nand this is the human nature at its rawest.\n\nAnd really the only reason we know about this\n\nis because of the diaries left behind\n\nand the historic value of the whole expedition itself.\n\nAnd that just shows how harsh these guys were living.\n\nIf you have to resort to something like that,\n\nit's just hell on earth.\n\nSo Orionis has asked, How to travel to the Arctic?\n\nYou can pull sledges like I do, carry everything with you.\n\nYou can go on snowmobiles with teams,\n\nyou can also go on dog teams, which I love doing in Alaska.\n\nI've worked with really good dog teams out there\n\ncalled Squid Dog Acres.\n\nSo these little blue bits of material are actually booties\n\nfor dogs to put on their feet.\n\nSo these dogs have actually running these.\n\nThis was one of the main transports back in the day\n\nfor dog teams to transport humans across the ice.\n\nAnd it's still used today in High Arctic areas,\n\nbut not in Antarctica.\n\nThey're not allowed dogs in Antarctica anymore\n\n'cause it's unnatural for dogs to be there.\n\nBut it is a main source of transport for the polar regions.\n\nSo aside from pulling sledges,\n\nwe also wear skis and we go back country skiing.\n\nSo we have the bindings which not are attached\n\nto the ski itself with the whole foot,\n\nit's just attached by the toe.\n\nIt allows you to pivot and push the ski along.\n\nSo we do this as we're pulling the sledges along.\n\nIt allows us to propel ourselves a greater distance\n\nusing less energy.\n\nSo I do extreme expeditions,\n\nbut the polar regions are accessible to anybody\n\nto go and venture into.\n\nYou just need to travel with the right company.\n\nDevan Flaherty has asked me about the third man factor.\n\nHas anybody ever experienced the third man factor?\n\nWhen I did the South Pole,\n\nI crossed there for 50 days without any music,\n\nanything to stimulate my brain.\n\nBut after a while,\n\nas I started to approach the South Pole itself,\n\nit's on a plateau of 3,000 meters\n\nand I started to push up this plateau\n\nand I was in quite a bit of pain.\n\nMy body was folding a little bit.\n\nI was really pushing against the wind\n\nas I was going forward.\n\nSo it was an horrendous time for me.\n\nAnd at that point, I felt an arm around my shoulder.\n\nI was alone.\n\nI felt somebody gripping onto my shoulder\n\nand somebody leaning into me\n\nwhispering words of encouragement,\n\nKeep going, keep going, keep going.\n\nAnd that allowed me to almost be quite zen.\n\nAnd even though I felt really relaxed\n\nas I was pushing forward, my mind was clearer,\n\nmy body was still probably struggling\n\nbut I didn't feel it inside and it felt great.\n\nAnd that happened about six\n\nor seven times on that expedition.\n\nAnd when I called for it, it never happened.\n\nWhen I got back to Canada,\n\nI spoke to a great explorer up there\n\nand said this is what happened\n\n'cause I was a little bit embarrassed as well.\n\nAnd he said that it happened\n\nto him on the way back from the North Pole when they tried\n\nto find this food area which they'd laid out on ice,\n\nthey'd lost it.\n\nSo they did a pattern search\n\nand something was telling him to go over towards the left.\n\nAnd as he walked 100 yards,\n\nhe found the food in the ice.\n\nI'm sure scientists would say that you are a lowest ebb\n\nand your mind was thinking that you had no other choice\n\nand I needed support.\n\nSo it manifested this support that I required.\n\nMy mom died 10 years prior to that.\n\nSo I could easily relate it to maybe it's the spirit\n\nof my mother coming through.\n\nAnd a lot of people might do that\n\nand I wouldn't smile at that or joke about it.\n\nIt's one of the two,.\n\nI'd like to think it's my mom, but who knows?\n\nSo Seetheuniverse has asked,\n\nIf you could bring one animal back from the North Pole\n\nto be a pet, what would you choose and why?\n\nAnd the bad news they're giving me\n\nis penguins don't live in the North.\n\nThanks for that. I didn't really know that.\n\nIf you are asking me what's my favorite animal\n\nand maybe a cuddly toy version of it,\n\nthen I would definitely bring back a lemming\n\n'cause it's very small, it's very cute,\n\nand it's very easy to hide away in my house away from people\n\nwho think a 58-year-old man shouldn't have a teddy bear.\n\nSo Licensedclown asks,\n\nWhat if I went to work in the Arctic?\n\nI feel like that would be cool.\n\nIt would be.\n\nHow many people can say they did that?\n\nI can talk about the Canadian High Arctic,\n\nwhich is probably half the size of Europe\n\nwith a human population of about 500 people.\n\nThere's two settlements, Greece Fjord and Resolute Bay,\n\nwhich have about 270 to 300 people in.\n\nAnd then there's a few research centers\n\naround a vast area which makes the numbers\n\nup to between four and 500 people.\n\nHowever, there's also polar bears roaming around that area.\n\nSo the polar bear population\n\nreally outweighs the human population.\n\nSo Quora asks, How does one prepare\n\nfor an expiration to the Arctic?\n\nAnd I think that to answer this, it's in preparation.\n\nThere's many things you have to pack for a polar expedition.\n\nBut the top five things\n\nthat I would recommend are these.\n\nA sleeping bag is essential for a good night's sleep.\n\nSleep is so important to how you perform the next day.\n\nA great tent, you need something which will withstand storms\n\nand keep you protected from the wind.\n\nA great cooker, something which will be reliable\n\nthrough the 50/100 days.\n\nAnd then the fourth thing is your navigation.\n\nAnd the final thing is if I was gonna drop all four of those\n\nand just pick one thing, it would be a location beacon.\n\nAnd if we don't take that with us, I think it's four highly.\n\nSo to take a navigational system with you to track\n\nwhere you are going and then to press it in your hour\n\nof need is so important\n\nbecause the success of an expedition\n\nis coming home safe and sound.\n\nI don't really take books or anything like that\n\n'cause they're too heavy.\n\nI take a little iPod with me with music on it\n\nand some podcasts on there as well.\n\nBut also I take a Dictaphone\n\n'cause I'm not great at writing things down\n\nas the pioneers used to do like great diaries.\n\nSo I actually sew it into my sleeping bag\n\nand at night when I've had something to eat\n\nand I'm nice and warm, tucked in my sleeping bag,\n\nand it's the winds blown outside\n\nand it's tremendously cold,\n\nI can sit in my sleeping bag and talk about the day\n\nand talk about how I feel, which I think is really important\n\nfor people to listen to.\n\nWhat are your biggest fears?\n\nThe cold, the natural predators, or the isolation?\n\nWhat draws humans to visit the Arctic\n\nand how can one visit the great north\n\nand leave it untouched?\n\nFor me, the biggest fear on exploration isn't polar bears,\n\nisn't the cold, it's the fear of giving in.\n\nIt's the fear of that moment\n\nwhere you find a weakness within your body and your heart\n\nand you say, I can't go on.\n\nAnd the trigger that keeps you going\n\nis the fact you truly believe in what you're doing,\n\nand also you have the mental knowledge to know\n\nthat it will get better.\n\nYou will progress\n\nand you will get to your destination in the end.\n\nSo when I was in Antarctica,\n\nthe plane did disappear and I was left on my own\n\nand I knew I had 50 days in front of me\n\nto reach the Geographic South Pole.\n\nI'd spent three years preparing for this\n\nand telling everybody I was gonna do it.\n\nSo I had a the weight of the world, if you like,\n\nupon my shoulders as I moved forward.\n\nBut five days into the journey,\n\nI lost a key element to my expedition, which was my music.\n\nLittle iPod that I took with me, I lost it in the ice.\n\nAnd yes, it was a white iPod that I lost.\n\nSo I had absolutely nothing to think about,\n\nbut my own thoughts and the silence\n\nand looking around 360 of nothing actually played on my mind\n\nto the point where I pitched my tent middle of the day\n\nand I sat in it and I thought, I can't do this anymore.\n\nThis was five days into the journey\n\nand I spent 36 hours in that tent just going through my mind\n\nof giving in, giving in, giving in all the time.\n\nI know I'm an older man, but I can be honest to you\n\nand say that I cried and I judge myself\n\nand what I was doing.\n\nAnd at that point, I got on my satellite phone,\n\nI phoned my friend back in the UK who knew me really well\n\nand I said, I want to give in.\n\nAnd he talked me through what was wrong,\n\nhow I could process things.\n\nHe talked me back on my feet\n\nbut he didn't make me move my feet.\n\nSo I packed everything away.\n\nThen I stood looking at the path in front of me\n\nand I just put one foot in front of the other,\n\none foot in front of the other,\n\nkept on doing that for another 1,000 feet.\n\nAnd that's how I reached the South Pole\n\nby just basically moving myself in the right direction.\n\nRemember_Sarah asks a good question.\n\nHow was the golden age of Arctic exploration possible\n\nbefore Hot Hands, which is what I want to know.\n\nHot Hands is like a pad that you can have in your hand,\n\nyou break it and it warms up your hands.\n\nThey're great if you're go skiing\n\nor if you are doing stuff like operating cameras\n\nand things like that.\n\nBut for what I do, I try not to use artificial heat.\n\nIt's a very short term thing.\n\nIt feels great at the time, then that's taken away\n\nand I'm back to being cold again.\n\nIt helps in in sense of emergencies,\n\nbut I don't generally use them just to warm myself up.\n\nYou've got to remember they didn't have these pads,\n\nbut what they did bring on their ships\n\nwere things like musical instruments,\n\nlike pianos and guitars and they have bottles of whiskey\n\nand wine and rum and all these different foods on the ship.\n\nAnd then they transported that to the ice\n\nand they took a lot of heavy equipment along with them.\n\nSo even though they didn't have the comfort of Hot Hands,\n\nthey had the comfort of other things that we take\n\nfor granted in normal life.\n\nSo TamsynVR asks, How cold is it right now?\n\nDo we need to dress like Arctic explorers?\n\nSo you don't just put big jackets on.\n\nYou have very, very thin layers that you wear\n\nthat are breathable, that trap air.\n\nAnd you can have two or three of those on\n\ndepending on how cold you are.\n\nAnd then you have a mid layer on top.\n\nAnd then if you are really, really cold,\n\nlike if you're static\n\nand not using your body to generate heat,\n\nthen you can put a big down jacket on,\n\nzip it right up with your hat and everything\n\nto keep me nice and warm.\n\nBut it all depends on what you're doing.\n\nIf you are moving, then your body will generate heat.\n\nIf you're static, then you will release heat from your body\n\nso you need to contain it.\n\nWhen you're in a tent at night\n\nand you're about to get into your minus 40 sleeping bags,\n\nso really great sleeping bags you need.\n\nThe mistake a lot of people make\n\nis they think, I'm really cold,\n\nso they wear all their jackets and everything\n\nand they get into the sleeping bag and they start to freeze.\n\nAnd the reason for that\n\nis because the sleeping bag is designed\n\nto contain the heat of the body.\n\nSo you heat up the bag, the bag doesn't heat up you.\n\nSo to wear less clothing in a sleeping bag\n\nis the important thing to do.\n\nWhat I do is I get into my sleeping bag\n\nand when it's freezing cold, I do a little jog.\n\nI move around quite a lot and I generate a lot of heat.\n\nThen I put the bag up, zip it up,\n\nand all that heat is then dispersed inside the bag.\n\nAnd that's how you keep warm.\n\nSo this is from Walter.\n\nHow our igloos built and how do they keep you warm?\n\nIgloos are built in igloo shape\n\nbecause it gives strength to the structure.\n\nIf it just had walls, then it'd be difficult\n\nto build a structured roof to it.\n\nAlso the ice that is used\n\nhas got very little water content.\n\nSo if you try to get the ice\n\nand scratch it up like a snowball,\n\nthen it would just flake away in your hands\n\n'cause it hasn't got anything to bind it together.\n\nSo that's why you cut bricks to build an igloo\n\nbecause it's more structural,\n\na bit like polystyrene if you like.\n\nThe igloos will keep you sheltered from the wind\n\nand you can actually light a fire inside\n\nor put your cooker on\n\nand that will then contain the heat inside.\n\nThe only technical thing you need to know about\n\nis how those fumes are released outside.\n\nIf it's sealed, you can actually succumb to the fumes.\n\nSo Romanticspiral, Walking to work today in a stormy\n\nwinter weather made me realize\n\nI have zero survival instincts.\n\nDrop me alone in the middle of the Arctic\n\nand I will give up within a day.\n\nIf the average person was dropped into the same area\n\nthat I operate in,\n\nit would be a rapid decrease in the mental\n\nand physical state.\n\nThere is a thing called Arctic shock,\n\nand that's the reality of where you are.\n\nThe coldness, that engulfed shoe,\n\nthe wind that whips around you,\n\nthe realization that you're not gonna be able\n\nto go into a building for the next two\n\nto three weeks can be quite intense on you.\n\nSo Arctic shock kicks in\n\nand basically that means that your body's telling you\n\nto give in at a very, very early stage.\n\nSo failure would be very, very quick for them\n\nunless you have that backing of experience.\n\nSo Simplebeauty asks,\n\nSo we're not gonna talk about Antarctica melting?\n\nWell, I've actually bought in some ice,\n\nwhich is over the course of 12 years from Antarctica\n\nand from the Arctic circle as well.\n\nSo this is ice from the Geographic North Pole,\n\nand this is ice from the Geographic South Pole.\n\nIn Antarctica, the ice is melting so fast\n\nand it's one of the most rapidly\n\nheating places on the planet.\n\nSo, so much research is being taken out there\n\nwith different teams from around the world.\n\nAnd when it comes round to the Arctic circle,\n\nbecause it's an ocean,\n\nobviously there's very, very different patterns there.\n\nBut with the Arctic, it's very, very different altogether\n\nbecause it's an ocean with land masses around it like Russia\n\nand Canada and places like that.\n\nSo you've got ice crossing all the way from Russia\n\nall the way to Canada,\n\nbut that ice is depleting.\n\nAd as the ice melts, the sea level rise.\n\nBut how does that work?\n\nBecause in ice cube in a glass, if the ice melts,\n\nit stays the same level,\n\nbut because the ice is so vast,\n\nit's got its own gravitational pull\n\nand it draws in water from all oceans\n\nfrom around the planet.\n\nAnd as it gets to the top of the world,\n\nit freezes and that's why you get this beautiful ice\n\nmass on top of the planet.\n\nBut because the world is heating up,\n\nthis ice is melting\n\nand it's now dispersing the water back around the planet\n\nso sea levels rise,\n\nand that's an explanation of what's happening at both poles.\n\nTo the naked eye, this looks very, very clear at both poles,\n\nbut in the Antarctic one, you've got ice,\n\nwhich is sat on top of land mass.\n\nSo it's pure ice sat on top of there in a pure area.\n\nAnd on this one, you've got ice from the ocean,\n\nthe Arctic ocean.\n\nSo I would imagine it's got salt content\n\nwithin this one though I haven't tested it,\n\nbut they are very, very different in their content.\n\nHetch Silence says, How do we make fire in the snow?\n\nWell, in my world as an explorer, I don't make fires.\n\nWe haven't got any trees, we've got nothing to burn.\n\nIt'd be wrong of me to burn anything\n\nout there anyway environmentally.\n\nSo what I use to heat up my food is a little cooker\n\nand we use fuel and we light that\n\nand it sets off the heat for the food,\n\nbut also heat for the tent as well.\n\nSo it warms me up at the same time and I go out\n\nand collect snow and ice and I melt that down, boil it up,\n\nand that's what I add to my food.\n\nSo actually the heater is a main source of survival.\n\nQuora writes, What was your most\n\nunexpected Arctic experience?\n\nOne of the most memorable was you expect\n\nto see a polar bear in the Arctic,\n\nbut one day a little lemming just decided\n\nto walk into the tent and it was a total shock.\n\nA lemming is a little rodent\n\nand he just walked in like it...\n\nWell, it was his home.\n\nI took some photographs and didn't touch him at all.\n\nAnd then he walked out and as I saw him walk out,\n\nhe sort of walked off into the ice\n\nand then just disappeared over a little bit of ice,\n\nand I thought, how does he survive in this wilderness?\n\nSo those are all the questions.\n\nThank you very much for them.\n\nIt's made me think about who I'm as an explorer,\n\nit's put me on my back foot.\n\nYou've occasionally made me smile as well.\n\nSo thanks for watching Polar Explorer Support.",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Greg Feith, former NTSB Air Safety Investigator.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Aviation Accident Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nILLDeaL_Q asks, Got my window seat.\n\nAnybody know where the safest spot is\n\nto sit on an airplane?\n\nThe best place to sit is where you can access an exit:\n\nover the wings or close proximity\n\nto either the forward exit or the rear exit.\n\nCount the seats between the exit in front of you\n\nand the exits behind you,\n\nbecause airplane crashes, unfortunately, don't occur\n\nwhere the airplane is upright.\n\nIt could be upside-down,\n\nit could be at night, it could be on fire.\n\nYou may not be able to stand up. You may have to crawl.\n\nKnowing your position in relation\n\nto the closest exit is your best bet.\n\nQuora asks, What do pilots say to the passengers\n\nof a plane when it is crashing?\n\nIs it like in the movies, or is it completely different?\n\nOne of the statements that you may hear is,\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have a situation.\n\nWe have a problem with the engine. It's under control.\n\nDon't worry about it. We're gonna divert.\n\nThat's a benign situation.\n\nIn a catastrophic,\n\nor at least a more dire or urgent situation,\n\nyou may not hear from the flight crew at all.\n\nIf anything, you may hear, Brace for impact\n\nbecause impact with the ground is imminent,\n\nbut you're not gonna hear a long discussion\n\nfrom the flight crew because their priority is to try\n\nand prevent the accident.\n\nMonkishine asks, I am amazed that a flock\n\nof birds can bring a plane down.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nThe size of the bird is what really matters.\n\nThere have been a number of events\n\nthat have taken place over the years,\n\nthe most recent one in history,\n\nthat a movie was made out of,\n\ncalled A Miracle on the Hudson,\n\ninvolving Captain Sully Sullenberger\n\nand First Officer Jeff Skiles.\n\nThe airplane had just taken off out of LaGuardia Airport.\n\nThey were climbing out,\n\nand they ran through a flock of geese at about 3,000 feet.\n\nUnfortunately, those geese were sucked into the engine.\n\nWith engines, they are built to withstand bird strikes\n\nto a certain extent, but when you look at a 20-pound goose,\n\nthat's like throwing a bowling ball\n\ninto the front end of an airplane\n\nat two or 300 miles an hour.\n\nThe airplane then turned into a giant glider.\n\nThe flight crew had to make a decision\n\nand put the airplane down in the water.\n\nThere are other elements of bird strikes.\n\nOne of the bird strike accidents\n\nthat I investigated several years ago involved an aircraft\n\nthat was going into Sioux Falls, South Dakota at night,\n\nand the pilots had forgotten one item on a checklist:\n\nwindshield heat.\n\nNow, the windows on an airplane,\n\nbecause it's pressurized, are very thick.\n\nBecause it flies at high altitude\n\nand the window gets cold-soaked,\n\nwe heat the windshields to temper the glass\n\nso that if something does strike it, it will not shatter.\n\nBut that one missed item on a checklist\n\nput this flight crew in peril.\n\nThis is a picture from inside the cockpit\n\nof a bird that was struck.\n\nIt was a two-pound duck,\n\ncame through an inch-and-a-half piece of glass.\n\nThe remnants then struck the captain, almost killed him.\n\nThe first officer had enough presence of mind,\n\ngot on the flight controls\n\nand actually successfully landed the airplane.\n\nI investigated a small general aviation accident\n\nwhere a very large bird, 22 pounds,\n\nactually came through the windscreen and struck both pilots,\n\na flight instructor and a student, killed both of them.\n\nWe build aircraft to mitigate these kinds of dangers,\n\nbut you can't build a bird-proof aircraft.\n\nNw18Graphics asks, During which flight stages\n\ndo most aviation accidents occur?\n\nTakeoff and landing.\n\nWe rarely have in-flight events at cruise altitude.\n\nEverything is working properly,\n\nthe airplane's typically on autopilot.\n\nTakeoff, you're heavy, low, and slow,\n\nso those are the most critical time,\n\nyou're putting the most strain on engines.\n\nAnd then, of course, landing.\n\nEven though you're lighter, you're approaching the ground,\n\nand so if there's any kind of weather event, wind shear,\n\ndowndrafts, your margin of safety is decreased.\n\nIf we're so close to the ground\n\nand we're not going that fast, are we going to survive\n\nor do we have a better chance of survival?\n\nYes, but you also have a better chance\n\nof survival even in flight.\n\nIf you look at an airplane that was built\n\nin the 1940s or 1950s or '60s,\n\ntoday, the airplanes are so much better\n\nas far as their structure.\n\nThey have certain collapse zones.\n\nThey have certain structures that break\n\nto absorb the energy.\n\nSeats are better on airplanes.\n\nThey can withstand higher G-loads than those accidents\n\nthat occurred with older airplanes.\n\nBasic Baka: Which accident investigation reports had\n\nthe biggest impact on the industry,\n\nor were the most controversial when they came out?\n\nThe one that is probably the most controversial\n\nis Malaysian Air MH370,\n\nthe airplane that disappeared over the South Indian Ocean.\n\nOne of the reasons that I think &MH370 has had\n\nsuch an impact is the fact that it's a mystery.\n\nThere's 2,000 feet of silt on the bottom\n\nof the ocean floor there.\n\nIf the airplane settled into that 2,000 feet of silt,\n\nyou will never see that aircraft because it's so deep.\n\nAnd in fact, the geography is like the Rocky Mountains.\n\nIf it crashed into one of the crevasses\n\nin that mountainous terrain,\n\nit may look like the terrain,\n\nso any side-scan sonar\n\nor any other technology may miss the aircraft.\n\nOne other controversial accident is TWA 800.\n\nThat was the aircraft\n\nthat blew up off the coast of New York.\n\nThere are a lot of conspiracy theorists out there\n\nthat still think that that airplane was shot down\n\nrather than having a mechanical malfunction\n\nin the center fuel tank\n\nthat ended up leading to an explosion.\n\nKate Neuens asks, Where is Malaysia Airlines flight 370?\n\nWhere did it go? Will it ever be found?\n\nThese are questions that keep me up at night.\n\nWhere is Malaysia Airlines?\n\nIt's in the middle of the South Indian Ocean on the bottom.\n\nWhere did it go?\n\n22,000 feet deep on the bottom of the South Indian Ocean.\n\nWill it ever be found? Possibly.\n\nThese are the questions that keep a lot\n\nof people up at night because it's the mystery.\n\nThis was an intentional act. This was not an accident.\n\nThe airplane flew for seven hours.\n\nIt ended up in a place where it shouldn't have ended up,\n\nand the only way it could have gotten there is by a pilot\n\nor pilots who navigated the airplane\n\nto the South Indian Ocean.\n\nPeople have said, Well, there was an in-flight fire.\n\nWell, there's no evidence to suggest that,\n\nand, two, if there was an in-flight fire,\n\nthe airplane wouldn't have been able to fly for seven hours.\n\nWas there some sort of nefarious act\n\nwhere somebody got into the electronics bay\n\nand did something with all the navigation stuff,\n\nand, of course, the airplane is sitting\n\non an island somewhere, covered by jungle?\n\nNo. You can't bury or hide a Boeing 777 very easily.\n\nThere are a lot of other conspiracy theories.\n\nThe most likely event was an intentional act.\n\nGodisGood4U_ asks,\n\nWhy do planes not have parachutes by now?\n\nBecause it would cost weight.\n\nYou couldn't build a parachute big enough\n\nto bring a 747 down.\n\nAnd as far as passengers being issued a parachute,\n\none, you'd have to train them.\n\nTwo, you'd never get out of an airplane.\n\nWhen would you use it?\n\nGiven the fact that accidents happen during landing\n\nand takeoff, you're already close to the ground.\n\nA parachute wouldn't be of any value to you.\n\nAndrewDixon8 asked the question,\n\nCan planes fly/land during thunderstorms?\n\nYes, airplanes can land in thunderstorms, to an extent.\n\nPilots don't intentionally fly in thunderstorms.\n\nOccasionally they will inadvertently\n\nencounter a thunderstorm.\n\nOne of the accidents that I investigated,\n\nAmerican Airlines 1420 at Little Rock, Arkansas,\n\nthe pilots did, unfortunately, make a bad decision\n\nto try and fly into thunderstorm activity,\n\nlanding the airplane at night.\n\nIn this particular picture,\n\nthe black line represents the initial flight path\n\nof the aircraft.\n\nYou can see the red over the top part of the airport.\n\nIn aviation, we say, Red is dead.\n\nThe aircraft started to hydroplane\n\nand, unfortunately, struck a very stout structure\n\nthat ripped the airplane open\n\nand, unfortunately, resulted in 12 fatalities.\n\nWe want to know what was going on with the flight crew,\n\nso we used the flight data recorder\n\nand the cockpit voice recorder\n\nto really put the big picture together for investigators.\n\nThe captain made this comment to the first officer\n\nas they were trying to find the airport:\n\nI hate droning around visually, at night, in weather\n\nwithout having some clue where I am.\n\nThat comment in and of itself requires the pilots to abandon\n\nwhat they were doing because it's only gonna get worse.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, in this particular accident,\n\nit got worse.\n\nAlmostglo3d asks, Denzel Washington saying,\n\n'I was drunk' on 'Flight' was diabolical.\n\nIt was storyline, it was compelling. It was a parody.\n\nOn the morning of the accident-\n\nI was drunk.\n\nYes, Denzel Washington was a spectacular pilot.\n\nHe was able, even in a drunk state,\n\nto roll the airplane inverted and save the day,\n\nbut in real life, that would never happen.\n\nWhile are issues that we see today in commercial\n\nand in private aviation regarding substance abuse,\n\nthe system itself will trapline those pilots\n\nor crew members that have access to the flight controls.\n\nThose pilots would never see the cockpit\n\nand never put that airplane into the same position\n\nthat Denzel Washington did.\n\nSo the best place to enjoy that kind\n\nof storyline is at the movies.\n\nMdizi_16 asks,\n\nWhat happens if a window on a plane cracks?\n\nDoes everybody die?\n\nIf you're at low altitude,\n\nthe aircraft will depressurize,\n\nbut it won't be a catastrophic explosion or decompression.\n\nIf you're at high altitude, 35,000 feet,\n\nthere will be a lot of debris,\n\nand, unfortunately, we've had people\n\nthat were sucked out of the aircraft.\n\nThat change in pressure is what causes the vacuum\n\nor things to then get sucked out of the aircraft\n\n'til the pressure equalizes.\n\nIf you're strapped in, you will survive.\n\nNuggetpalooza asks, Is anyone familiar enough\n\nwith the Sully case that knows if the NTSB was out\n\nto get Sullenberger in real life\n\nas they appear in the movie?\n\nThe movie, in my opinion,\n\n10 minutes of fact, 90 minutes of fiction.\n\nHuman-piloted simulation showed\n\nthat you could make it back to the airport.\n\nNo, they don't.\n\nThe NTSB was not out to get Sullenberger\n\nor any other pilot.\n\nThe NTSB in its normal interview process always asks,\n\nTell us your story. Tell us what happened.\n\nLet's look at the procedures you followed.\n\nWhy did you make these decisions?\n\nUnfortunately for the movie, it wasn't compelling enough.\n\nSometimes facts are boring.\n\nFearlessflyer1 asks,\n\nThe probability of being killed in an airplane accident\n\nis one in...\n\nIt's actually one in 11 million.\n\nAviation is the safest form of transportation,\n\nbar none, around the world.\n\nYour chances of getting struck by lightning are greater.\n\nDefinitely your chances of getting killed\n\nin an automobile accident are greater.\n\nWe have more train accidents, bus accidents,\n\npedestrian accidents.\n\nYou have a higher probability of getting hurt\n\nor killed riding your bicycle\n\nor crossing the street than being involved\n\nin a fatal airplane accident.\n\nMindofrob asks,\n\nWhat if 'Snakes on a Plane' really happened?\n\nIf they really happened, put your feet up on the seat\n\nand don't piss off the snake.\n\nMeanOokami asks, Do you have any tips\n\nor advice for someone who has aerophobia?\n\nYes, relax.\n\nOne of the things that we say in aviation is,\n\nTime to spare, go by air.\n\nYou have to have patience.\n\nBecause if you don't have patience,\n\nyour anxiety level increases.\n\nThe biggest and best thing I think\n\nthat passengers can do is familiarize yourself\n\nwith the noises.\n\nWhen the airplane takes off,\n\nyou hear all this clunking sound.\n\nThat's the landing gear being retracted.\n\nIf you look out the window, you see parts of the wing move.\n\nThose are the flaps.\n\nThose are designed to not only increase lift\n\nduring slow speeds, like the takeoff,\n\nbut also increase drag for landing.\n\nIf you go into turbulence, don't think about,\n\nOh, my gosh, the wings are gonna break off,\n\nwhich they won't, think about the fun part of it,\n\nthat, yes, it feels like a roller coaster,\n\nthe bottom fell out.\n\nI've sat with people who,\n\nI mean, they're white-knuckled on the seat.\n\nI explain all the noises.\n\nI try to educate them to the basics of aviation.\n\nAnd once they understand that,\n\nit doesn't make 'em feel so bad.\n\nB4wekiss asks, 4:00 AM thoughts.\n\nFirst off, what are you doing up at 4:00 AM?\n\nWouldn't all planes landing be controlled crashes?\n\nYou could look at it that way.\n\nYes, you are controlling that weight.\n\nYou are controlling the energy\n\nwith the thrust of the engines\n\nand, of course, the controls that pilots have.\n\nThe good thing is the airplane isn't damaged\n\nand you get to taxi to the terminal.\n\nJIGGY_JIGGZ_ asks,\n\nAny of y'all remember ValuJet Flight 592?\n\nI remember it because I was the investigator in charge,\n\nand I used this particular accident in a lot\n\nof the safety presentations I do worldwide.\n\nThere was a radio call shortly after departure by the pilot.\n\n[Controller] [indistinct] 592, connect Miami Center 13245.\n\n[Pilot] [indistinct] I need to return to Miami.\n\n[Controller] What kind of problem are you having?\n\n[Pilot] Smoke in the cockpit, smoke in the cabin.\n\nThey had smoke in the cockpit, smoke in the cabin.\n\nThat right there gave us an indication\n\nthat we had possibly an in-flight fire.\n\nIn the meantime, we were looking at the aircraft\n\nin the Florida Everglades.\n\nWe were really gonna depend on the flight data recorder\n\nand the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nOne question by one investigator changed the entire\n\ncourse of the investigation in 30 seconds.\n\nWhat are oxygen canisters?\n\nIn aviation, we typically use oxygen bottles.\n\nThey're typically painted green.\n\nThis is the remnants of what we started to find\n\nof these 144 oxygen canisters.\n\nWe knew that they had been exposed to fire.\n\nThis final picture is the key.\n\nThis is an exemplar oxygen generator.\n\nThere is a 32-caliber percussion cap,\n\nand it starts an exothermic reaction.\n\nWhen you ship these, you need to have a plastic cap\n\nto prevent inadvertent firing.\n\nNone of these oxygen generators had that protective cap.\n\nThe fact that there was a 2-cent cap\n\nthat was not put on cost the lives of 110 people.\n\nQuora asks,\n\nWhat does a airplane crash investigator look for\n\napart from the black box?\n\nAs investigators, we're constantly looking\n\nfor the best available evidence,\n\nphysical evidence, that is the aircraft wreckage itself.\n\nWe're gonna examine the propeller.\n\nWe're gonna look at the engine,\n\nwe're gonna look for damage.\n\nWas there an in-flight breakup?\n\nWas there a structural failure?\n\nWe want to know if there was a fault in the computer\n\nor the software that may have caused\n\nor contributed to the accident.\n\nA very famous issue that came up early on\n\nwith Airbus was the fact that the computers\n\non their Airbus airplanes would go to sleep in flight.\n\nAirbus had to fix that problem.\n\nWe use meteorologists to study the environment\n\nif there's a weather accident.\n\nA lot of aircraft accidents now are being captured on video.\n\nThis Ring doorbell video shows the moment right\n\nbefore impact of a general aviation aircraft,\n\na single-engine Mooney,\n\nwhere the wings actually broke in flight.\n\nPart of the tail section is missing.\n\nThis is the cockpit section of a Gulfstream business jet\n\nthat, unfortunately, crashed on takeoff.\n\nThere was a post-crash fire,\n\nbut there's still valuable evidence for investigators.\n\nYou can look at handle positions.\n\nHere's the flap handle right here. Here's trim.\n\nThese are the control yokes.\n\nThat gives us an understanding of whether\n\nor not they properly configured the airplane for takeoff.\n\nOne of the other tools that we use\n\nas investigators is taking information\n\nthat we know into a simulator.\n\nWe try to recreate based on factual data.\n\nDid the pilots have options?\n\nCould they have recognized the situation with the aircraft\n\nbefore it got out of control?\n\nBlackwel110 asks,\n\nWhat does the flight data recorder,\n\ntelemetry technical recordings, show?\n\nIt shows a lot.\n\nIt tells investigators what the airplane was doing:\n\npitch, roll, yaw, altitude.\n\nIt also gives us flight control positions\n\nand things like that.\n\nSome of that data is used to create a profile.\n\nThis is the flight profile of an aircraft that crashed,\n\nthat had just taken off.\n\nWhat we found from the flight data recorder\n\nis that the pilot didn't initiate the takeoff.\n\nThe airplane actually started to become airborne by itself,\n\nand the key was right in this section.\n\nWe knew that the control position was different\n\nthan the actual altitude of the aircraft.\n\nThe pilot was actually pushing forward\n\nbecause the nose was rising, and he could not control it.\n\nUnfortunately, because of their low altitude,\n\nthey struck the ground before they were able to make it back\n\nto the runway.\n\nCyclone_dave asks,\n\nThis isn't the first time a plane was brought down\n\ndeliberately by a pilot.\n\nAmong others are EgyptAir Flight 990\n\nand SilkAir Flight 185.\n\nThere is a distinct difference\n\nbetween an intentional act and an accident.\n\nEgyptAir 990 was the 767 that crashed\n\noff the coast of New York\n\nbecause the first officer basically pushed the nose over\n\nat a low altitude, the airplane went into the ocean.\n\nSilkAir Flight 185 is an accident\n\nthat I represented the United States over in Indonesia on\n\nbecause it was a 737 that, from 35,000 feet,\n\nthe pilot had an intent to kill himself\n\nand the passengers and crew on that airplane\n\nby rolling it inverted,\n\nhitting the water at almost Mach 1 speed.\n\nFsdpodcast asks,\n\nWhat role does pilot training play\n\nin preventing accidents?\n\nPilots are trained not only to understand what's going on,\n\nbut if there is going to be some level of an accident\n\nor serious incident, they're there to mitigate the damage\n\nto the aircraft and increase the survivability\n\nof crew and passengers.\n\nThese are screenshots of an animation created\n\nfor an accident that I investigated,\n\nAmerican Airlines MD-80.\n\nThe aircraft is off-center from the runway.\n\nThat's a critical issue.\n\nThe pilot should have abandoned the approach.\n\nThese other screenshots show\n\nthat the airplane landed sideways.\n\nThe pilots lost control, overran the runway,\n\nand, unfortunately, struck obstructions at the end\n\nof the runway, which resulted in 12 fatalities.\n\nThis is an aircraft accident involving\n\na small business-type jet.\n\nYou actually see the airplane has rolled 90 degrees.\n\nThat's because they deployed the thrust reversers in flight,\n\nand they deployed asymmetrically,\n\nwhich caused the aircraft to roll.\n\nThe pilots tried to do something\n\nthat wasn't in the flight manual,\n\nand, unfortunately, it cost them their lives.\n\nMasterv1h0ha asked the question,\n\nWhy are Boeing planes suddenly falling out of the sky?\n\nThey aren't falling out of the sky,\n\nand there's nothing sudden about it.\n\nUnfortunately, Boeing has had an issue\n\nover the past 10 years\n\nwith their aircraft and aircraft accidents.\n\nIt started really with the 787\n\nand the initial battery issues,\n\nwhich caused in-flight fires.\n\nThere was also in the 737 MAX accidents,\n\nboth in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nThat has really drawn the attention of the public.\n\nBoeing does have issues\n\nwith quality control in their manufacturing process\n\nand some design issues, but every manufacturer has issues.\n\nAirbus, Embraer, it does not matter.\n\nThere have been Airbus accidents in the recent past,\n\nthey just haven't drawn the scrutiny\n\nlike the Boeing accidents.\n\nStevendiercks1: They should put GPS trackers\n\non airplanes so that they don't disappear\n\nlike Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\nWell, Steven, guess what? We do track airplanes.\n\nWe track 'em all over the world.\n\nWe've always used conventional radar.\n\nAs the radar signal is bounced off the airplane,\n\nit's returned.\n\nAn air traffic controller can actually see it on a scope.\n\nNow we have a new technology\n\ncalled Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast,\n\nand it actually is providing information directly\n\nfrom the airplane back to the air traffic controller\n\nwith a lot more specificity every second.\n\nSo we know speed, we know altitude.\n\nWe actually know the GPS position of the aircraft.\n\nA lot of the commercial aircraft,\n\nactually the engines are pumping down data\n\nto the manufacturer, so that they have tracking data\n\nfor the airlines, so that they can understand the health\n\nof the engine during a flight.\n\nSo we're tracking these airplanes all the time.\n\nThe biggest problem, especially with MH370,\n\nis that there are black spots,\n\nthat is voids, in the coverage around the world.\n\nWe have over-the-horizon-looking radar,\n\ntypically 12 to 1,500 miles from the radar site,\n\nbut we don't have a radar site positioned\n\nin the middle of the Indian Ocean.\n\nMH370 really wakened the eyes of the aviation community\n\nthat we need better tracking worldwide so that we do get rid\n\nof these voids or these blackout areas.\n\nPrroteus asks,\n\nHow often can pilots actually prevent crashes\n\nduring dangerous, catastrophic events?\n\nIf it leads to a major crash,\n\nit's probably because it was beyond the pilot's control.\n\nOne example, United Airlines 232,\n\nSioux City, Iowa, DC-10.\n\nThe fan section in the center section\n\nof the aircraft failed, cut the hydraulic lines,\n\nrendering the airplane incapacitated.\n\nThe pilots had to use differential power\n\non both the wing engines,\n\nto not only help the airplane climb or descend,\n\nbut maintain control and steer the aircraft.\n\nThe Miracle on the Hudson accident,\n\ninvolving an Airbus A320,\n\nCaptain Sullenberg and First Officer Jeff Skiles,\n\nthe pilots had to make split-second decisions based\n\non the best available evidence\n\nand information that they had.\n\nSullenberg actually took control of the airplane.\n\nHe could feel the performance.\n\nHe knew that, really, his only viable option\n\nwas to land in the river.\n\nThat was seat-of-the-pants flying,\n\nas it's called in aviation,\n\nand they landed it with the least amount of damage.\n\nThey were all able to survive, evacuate the aircraft,\n\nand they were able to be rescued.\n\n_AJ73 asks, Korean Air Flight 801 missed final approach.\n\nHow bad?\n\nWell, I actually represented the United States\n\nin that investigation\n\nbecause I was the investigator in charge.\n\nThe fact is they did not miss the final approach.\n\nThey actually crashed on final approach.\n\nUnfortunately, it was six miles from the airport\n\nbecause they hit a hill,\n\nand that's because the flight crew didn't understand how\n\nto fly a non-precision electronic approach.\n\nUnfortunately, 250 plus people died in that accident,\n\nbut we did learn about spurious signals\n\naffecting navigation systems on the airplane.\n\nShe's Fishy asks,\n\nWhat happens if you don't use your cell phone\n\nin airplane mode on a plane?\n\nThe signal coming off of your phone or your iPad\n\nor even your computer can disrupt,\n\na lot of the times, the navigation system,\n\neven the ground proximity warning systems on an airplane.\n\nThe wires on an airplane are insulated\n\nfrom spurious signals, but you don't want to take a chance,\n\naircraft manufacturers don't want to take a chance,\n\nand definitely the FAA and other certifying authorities\n\ndon't want to take a chance.\n\nIn the interest of aviation safety, turn off your phone.\n\nMarlodjur asks,\n\nAnyone else who isn't afraid of flying\n\never just remember Aloha Airlines Flight 243\n\nand just have a good think on that?\n\nUnfortunately, it was a fatal accident\n\nbecause it happened at altitude,\n\nand we lost a flight attendant\n\nwhen the top of the airplane separated\n\nfrom the rest of the structure.\n\nThat accident will never happen again.\n\nThe reason for it\n\nis because we have better inspection process.\n\nThat was an older 737 that had developed a crack.\n\nThe crack was missed during an inspection.\n\nSo those are all the great questions we have for today.\n\nThanks for watching Aviation Accident Support,\n\nand fly safe.

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Jennifer Sciubba, and I study demographic data.\n\nLet's answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Population Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@Virilian4: How many people have ever lived\n\non this earth?\n\nSo there have been about 108 billion people, as an estimate,\n\nwho have ever taken a breath on planet Earth.\n\nIf you went back to say, year one,\n\nthere would be about 55 billion people\n\nwho had ever taken a breath.\n\nAnd there are 8 billion people who live on planet Earth,\n\n7% of the 108 billion who have ever taken a breath.\n\nHere's a question from Quora.\n\nIs the majority of the world's population\n\nchildren or adults?\n\nWell, the majority of the world's population is adults.\n\n70% of us are over the age of 18.\n\nEven in Africa, which is the youngest region in the world,\n\n54% of the population is adults.\n\nCountries have seen a steady increase\n\nin their life expectancy over time.\n\nWorld population is growing older,\n\nand that's because the number\n\nof children per woman has gone down.\n\nOne way to think about it is,\n\nthe average woman about 50 years ago\n\nwould have had four children in her lifetime,\n\nbut the average woman globally today has only two.\n\nSo if we think about lining everyone on the planet up\n\nfrom the youngest person to the oldest person,\n\nlike where would the center of gravity be?\n\nThe center of gravity has shifted over time\n\nas the average number of children per woman has gone down.\n\n@JDCrowe13: Quiz:\n\nWhat is the fastest growing minority in America?\n\nIf you answered hipster, then you win the prize.\n\nActually, if you answered Asian Americans,\n\nyou would win the prize.\n\nThey are the fastest growing minority in the United States,\n\nand they're about 7% of the US population.\n\n@BenPo234: What are the signature demographics\n\nof a red state versus a blue state?\n\nIf we think most generally,\n\na red state most often would be more rural,\n\nprobably have an older population, and is whiter.\n\nBlue state would have more urban areas,\n\nethnically or racially diverse,\n\nand probably a younger population.\n\nBut you may notice that it doesn't always map that way.\n\nThat's why on election night it wasn't really just enough\n\nfor us to see the 50 states projected on the screen\n\nand try to figure out how the election would turn.\n\nYou could start to zoom in\n\nand see really different dynamics,\n\nlike Tennessee, for example,\n\nthat is relatively a red state across,\n\nand then with these little blue dots\n\nin the Memphis, Nashville areas.\n\nA state like Maine is the most rural state\n\nin the United States, but it still has lots of blue areas,\n\nand those are its urban areas.\n\nSo if you're talking about like a House race\n\nor a Senate race, you can see how those sub-state red\n\nand blue areas really show up and matter\n\nfor what a vote looks like.\n\n@StallmansBeard: Is immigration a net positive\n\nor negative?\n\nOne way we wanna think about it is through an economic lens.\n\nIn the United States, immigrants are actually most likely\n\nto be of working ages.\n\nThe US has a total fertility rate below replacement level\n\nof 1.6 children per woman on average,\n\nmeans immigration contributes quite a bit\n\nto the growth in the working-age population here.\n\nWe can see that foreign-born population,\n\nvery few children under five,\n\nvery few five to 17 years of age,\n\nmuch more concentrated in terms of 18 to 64\n\nor those working ages, versus US-born population.\n\nImmigration is kind what propels\n\nthat overall population growth.\n\nIf the US were to stop all immigration right now,\n\nnot do anything else between now and the end of the century,\n\nthe US population would shrink by over 30%.\n\n@venompilled wants to know, Why do fertility rates matter?\n\nWell, they matter a lot\n\nbecause the impact, its age structure for example,\n\nand, of course, its size.\n\nWe can actually see this if we look at snapshots in time\n\nof a handful of countries in the world today.\n\nFemales on this side and males on this side,\n\nfrom age zero all the way up to over a hundred.\n\nSo if we're looking at Ethiopia here,\n\nwe can see this classic pyramid shape means\n\nthat it's a population\n\nwhere women have, on average, more than two children.\n\nSo the population is a lot more bottom-heavy,\n\nwhich means that there are a lot more younger people\n\nin the country there.\n\nIf you had one that's fertility rate\n\nof four children per woman on average,\n\neach generation's twice the size of the one before it.\n\nVersus if we look at a country like Turkey,\n\nyou can see that that center of gravity in terms of ages\n\nis in the middle more, and that's because they've had close\n\nto replacement level fertility rates for a while,\n\naverage number of children of 1.9 per woman.\n\nSo we see that that population is growing older.\n\nThe bulk of the people would be here of these working ages.\n\nAnd then we get to Japan.\n\nIt's not really a population pyramid anymore,\n\nit's more of a tree.\n\nThere are lots of older people in this society.\n\nSome of that is longevity.\n\nAnd so you can see this narrowing here at the bottom,\n\nand that just shows you that women of reproductive ages,\n\nthey're having under replacement level fertility rates.\n\nSo why do those fertility rates matter?\n\nIf you're in Ethiopia and you're a policymaker,\n\nprobably one of your bigger concerns\n\nis how to build enough schools, year after year,\n\nfor all of these young people aging into kindergarten,\n\nand then how to have enough jobs for those\n\nwho are aging into the workforce.\n\nIf you're in Turkey,\n\nyou're thinking about the working-age population, certainly,\n\nand their jobs there, but you also need to be thinking\n\nabout how, in just a few years, these folks will be moving\n\ninto retirement ages, and how do you plan for that?\n\nAnd if you're in Japan, you're thinking about how schools\n\nare closing year after year.\n\nYou have a much smaller workforce needing\n\nto support a growing population of older people.\n\nSo age structures, which are affected by fertility rates,\n\nreally matter for even setting the agenda\n\nat the national level.\n\n@TommyBoyOH: Is the real issue\n\nthat we have too many humans on the planet?\n\nSo, in a few hundred years,\n\nwhen the world population is over 50 billion,\n\nwhat will our problems be then?\n\nWe will never have a population of 50 billion,\n\nat least not anywhere close to it with our trends right now.\n\nBest estimates are somewhere around the year 2080\n\nand we'll top out at between nine and 10 billion people.\n\nNow, we're reasonably certain about this\n\nbecause our trends in fertility rates and mortality rates,\n\nthey're following a fairly predictable pattern.\n\nThe uncertainty comes from really just two things.\n\nOne is, how fast will fertility rates fall\n\nin places where they're currently still high?\n\nAnd there really aren't that many places in the world\n\nwhere fertility rates are really high.\n\nThey're mostly concentrated in a few countries\n\nin Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWe live in a world where there are only eight countries,\n\nout of 200 something countries,\n\nwhere women have five or more children.\n\nThat includes Nigeria, for example,\n\nwhich is a pretty big country.\n\nKeeps global population young.\n\nWe have not seen any indication\n\nthat it's gonna come up in places where it's low.\n\nSo I feel pretty confident we'll be hitting a peak\n\nof somewhere between nine and 10 billion people\n\nroughly around the year of 2080.\n\n@HawaiianPace asks, How can Elon Musk be worried\n\nabout population decline when Nick Cannon exists?\n\nElon and Nick Cannon maybe have something in common,\n\nwhich is they might be single-handedly trying\n\nto change global trends.\n\nGlobal population growth has been declining since the 1960s.\n\nYou can see this peak here in the mid 1960s.\n\nSo that rate of growth is really going down over time.\n\nThis is what's happening beneath the surface,\n\nwhile on top, we see world population continuing to grow\n\nto where we have 8 billion today.\n\nSo why is Elon Musk worried about declining population?\n\nIt's because what's happening right now\n\nis the beneath-the-surface trends are starting to catch up\n\nto what we actually see on the surface,\n\nwhere there's over 60 countries in the world\n\nthat have shrinking populations.\n\nWe have two parents.\n\nSo to keep population growth steady,\n\nyou would want to replace them with two children.\n\nThat would be a steady growth.\n\nBut in some countries, Singapore for example,\n\nyou only have one child born for those two parents.\n\nSo you can see how those populations\n\nof those countries would start to shrink over time.\n\nAnd that's happening especially in a lot\n\nof high-income countries.\n\nSo the reason why somebody like Elon Musk would be concerned\n\nabout this is you end up with smaller generations over time,\n\nmeaning fewer producers and fewer consumers.\n\n@shufflupaguss: I'm on a road trip right now,\n\nand I'm wondering what's up with these empty small towns?\n\nAre they ghost towns? Is depopulation real?\n\nSo depopulation is not only real,\n\nthere are a lot of governments\n\nwho are really worried about this\n\nbecause of what it means for economic vitality\n\nor national security.\n\nTake China, for example:\n\nobviously one of the world's biggest economies,\n\nhuge player on the international stage,\n\nbut also a rapidly shrinking population.\n\nLook at a country like Italy\n\nand how many of the villages are depopulating.\n\nIf you're in Europe, South Korea, Japan,\n\nyou're seeing areas of the country empty out.\n\nWe've seen pictures all over the newspapers\n\nof towns and villages in Japan with ivy growing\n\nthrough the windows from abandoned homes,\n\nstorefronts start to close.\n\nThese fertility rates are lower,\n\nand then that means the population of these small towns\n\nand cities is growing older and older\n\nand then eventually dying out\n\nwithout any young people there to replace them.\n\nAnd you don't necessarily see people moving\n\nfrom bigger cities all the way out to very small towns\n\nand very rural areas\n\nbecause there's no job opportunities there.\n\nNow, you do see some retirees doing that.\n\nTake a state like Maine, for example:\n\nMost rural state in the United States actually has seen\n\nan influx of retirees moving there,\n\nbut that's not because they're moving there\n\nfor job opportunities.\n\nThe United States itself is not shrinking overall,\n\nbut there are plenty of places within the United States\n\nthat are shrinking.\n\nNow, we've had plenty of examples\n\nof depopulation in the past.\n\nI mean, think about Detroit\n\nand the collapse of that auto industry there,\n\nbut we've not ever seen this scale of depopulation,\n\nplus, of course, people often leaving these areas.\n\nBecause, you know, once an area starts to depopulate,\n\nof course fewer people will be wanting to stay there.\n\nThe jobs leave, the community\n\nand the vitality part of that disappears as well,\n\nand so it can kind of accelerate that depopulation.\n\nHere is a question from Quora.\n\nWhat countries do most immigrants to America come from?\n\nWell, top countries of origin for US immigrants in 2022,\n\nthis number here, 23% were from Mexico, 6% from India,\n\n6% from China, 4% Philippines, and then El Salvador,\n\nVietnam, and Cuba, all 3%, and Korea 2%.\n\nThis has actually been changing over time.\n\nImmigration from Mexico has really dropped over time.\n\nMexico's economy has been growing.\n\nTheir total fertility rate is actually the same\n\nas the fertility rate in the United States, 1.6.\n\nAnd so we've seen less Mexican immigration\n\nto the US over time, as a proportion,\n\nwhereas we've seen countries to the south\n\nof Mexico really increasing.\n\nYou know, think about gang violence\n\nand instability in countries like El Salvador or Guatemala.\n\nThat's really been a driver of some\n\nof that northward migration.\n\nSo those are the top countries of origin,\n\nbut if we look broader at the regions,\n\nwe see that Latin America's 50% of immigrants\n\nto the United States in 2022,\n\nbut Asia was 31% of migrants to the US in that year.\n\nSmaller percentages for Europe, 10%,\n\nAfrica, 6%, Canada and Oceania.\n\n@maureen_jo: Why are people leaving California\n\nfor Texas and Arizona?\n\nIf we look at the way that the US population has changed\n\nbetween the 2010 census and the 2020 census,\n\nyou still saw lots of growth in the population\n\nin places in California,\n\nand this pink here really shows you places\n\nwhere you started to lose population.\n\nSo a lot of the US Northeast started\n\nto see some emptying out.\n\nBut we saw during the pandemic that people were moving\n\nto take advantage of states without income taxes.\n\nNashville really started to boom.\n\nTennessee is a state without an income tax.\n\nFlorida, similarly, a state without an income tax.\n\nA lot of people started to move there.\n\nJobs would move there as well.\n\nAfter the pandemic, we've really continued\n\nto see growth in the US Southeast.\n\nBetween the middle of 2022 and the middle of 2023,\n\nyou saw the US Southeast grow by about 1.1%,\n\nwhereas the Northeast actually shrank,\n\nwhile there were other regions in the US\n\nthat either barely grew or even shrank.\n\nCraig'sbrotherBrian wants to know,\n\nI've been to the most densely populated city in the world.\n\nHave you? Do you know what city that is?\n\nI do know, it's Manila in the Philippines\n\nwith approximately 46,000 people per square kilometer,\n\nand I haven't been there yet.\n\nDoomBro_Max asks, What made the world population increase\n\nso drastically after 1900?\n\nWe had great improvements in public health, sanitation,\n\nnutrition, antibiotics,\n\nand that allowed those people who were born\n\nto live into their reproductive ages.\n\nSo this chart really lays it out for us.\n\nIf we go way back in time, 200,000 years ago,\n\nthere's very little global growth.\n\nEven as we go through time, 2000 BCE for example,\n\nor year one, the global population,\n\nthe number of people here at any one point in time,\n\nis really growing slowly,\n\nand that's because our birth rates and our death rates,\n\nthose really matched each other.\n\nBut we start to see a major shift,\n\nour first 1 billion people happening here\n\naround the year 1800.\n\nAnd then we hit our second billion a lot faster,\n\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and now up to 8 billion people.\n\nAnd so a lot of those increases are really happening\n\nbecause we're living longer.\n\nDystopian Paradise wants to know,\n\nIn terms of age, what state has the oldest population?\n\nThe oldest state is Maine,\n\nwhich has 23% of the population above age 65.\n\nClassic Man wants to know,\n\nWhich state has the youngest population?\n\nThat state would be Utah,\n\nwhich has 27% of the population under the age of 18.\n\nYou may notice that Utah is a home\n\nto a pretty sizable Mormon population,\n\nwhich tends to have higher births than other populations\n\nin the United States.\n\n@JustinLUngs: What's the biggest difference\n\nbetween millennials and Gen Z?\n\nThe biggest difference is that globally, Gen Z,\n\nor those people who were born from 1997 to 2012,\n\nare larger than millennials,\n\nwho were born between 1981 and 1996.\n\nBut in the United States, millennials are larger than Gen Z.\n\nGen Z, though, is much more racially diverse.\n\nSo the percentage of Gen Z who are multiracial\n\nis about 4% in the United States,\n\nwhereas it's only 2% among millennials in the US.\n\nThe share of people who are Hispanic\n\nis actually about 4% higher among Gen Z in the US\n\nthan it is among millennials in the US.\n\n@JMPFreedom: WTF is a sandwich generation?\n\nSandwich generation might sound delicious,\n\nbut it's pretty terrible.\n\nIt's those who are sandwiched between caring\n\nfor younger children and caring for older parents.\n\nPeople are having children later in life.\n\nThere's a trend towards that in the United States,\n\nin Japan, South Korea, Germany.\n\nAnd so you could end up with a situation\n\nwhere a woman is taking care of her one or two children\n\nat the same time that she's caring for her aging parents,\n\nwho may live with her, or who need her to come by\n\nand help with medical appointments or grocery shopping.\n\nSome people will call this the panini generation, actually,\n\nbecause these women are being squeezed in the middle.\n\nFrom Reddit: What would happen\n\nif all illegal immigrants were deported?\n\nWell, in the United States,\n\nwe've got a stock of around 12 million people in the US.\n\nLots of things would probably happen.\n\nThere are certain industries in the United States\n\nthat actually are really heavily dependent\n\non that kind of labor.\n\nSo the agricultural industry, for example.\n\nSo you could expect having a harder time getting people\n\nto fill those jobs, and then prices for food would rise.\n\nThe construction industry is much more heavily dependent\n\non that labor, and so we expect it'd take longer\n\nto get houses built, and prices would rise for that as well.\n\nIn the United States,\n\nthere are over 16 million people who live in a household\n\nwith at least one undocumented person.\n\nOver 7% of all kids in the United States\n\nhave at least one undocumented parent,\n\nso we would see families being ripped apart\n\nthrough these deportations.\n\nErik Kroll wants to know,\n\nHow do factors like income, race, geographic location,\n\net cetera, affect your life expectancy?\n\nThey affect it a lot. Let's look at income first.\n\nSo we have here a map of the US with the counties drawn out.\n\nWe can see here that some of the poorest counties\n\nin the United States, like McDowell County, West Virginia,\n\nwith a median income of under $29,000 a year,\n\nit has a life expectancy well below the US national average.\n\nThe same is true for Buffalo County, South Dakota,\n\nwith a median income of just over $30,000 a year.\n\nEast Carroll Parish, Louisiana,\n\nalso one of our poorest counties,\n\nand Issaquena County, Mississippi,\n\nlife expectancy of under 75 years\n\nand median household income of only over $17,000 a year.\n\nIt's not just powerful geography on the US scale,\n\nit's also powerful at the global scale.\n\nSo here's a couple of different ways to slice it.\n\nLet's stay over here with this yellow color for now.\n\nGlobal life expectancy in 2024:\n\nHigh-income countries, life expectancy is 81 years,\n\nmiddle income, 73 years.\n\nBut low-income countries, life expectancy is only 65 years.\n\nMost people know this, but, of course, sex matters.\n\nFemales tend to live longer than males,\n\n76 years on average globally versus 71 years\n\nfor their male counterparts.\n\nMostly demographers will nail down\n\nthat men tend to be in riskier jobs.\n\nWhen you get to the very oldest ages,\n\nthey're very heavily female, with women outliving men.\n\nSo that's something that countries either are\n\nor should be talking about.\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, social security,\n\nthese things all go together.\n\nThey all affect the life expectancy of an individual.\n\nAnd, of course, we aggregate that,\n\nand they affect the life expectancy of a country as well.\n\n@ChildishHambino wants to know,\n\nWhat country has the lowest life expectancy?\n\nI can't take another 62 years of this pish.\n\nOkay, well, lowest life expectancy at birth\n\nfor males is in Chad, and that's at 53 years.\n\nLowest life expectancy at birth for females is in Nigeria,\n\nand that is 55 years.\n\n@AizazReal: What country has the highest life expectancy?\n\nWell, the answer for males is tiny Monaco,\n\nwhich has only 40,000 people,\n\nbut where males born can be expected to live to age 84.\n\nMonaco and other small countries, like Lichtenstein,\n\nthey're really rich, they're small and rich.\n\nAnd so we know that income level actually\n\nis very highly correlated with life expectancy.\n\nIf you're thinking in terms of, you know,\n\ncountries you'd be more familiar with, those bigger ones,\n\nin Japan, females live to about 87 years.\n\nIsaac wants to know, People are living longer,\n\nbut are they living healthier at the same time?\n\nHealthy life expectancy is one thing,\n\nan overall life expectancy is another.\n\nHealthy life expectancy is, you know,\n\nhow many years can you expect to live in good health\n\nversus how many years you might live overall.\n\nI think ideally for any of us,\n\nyou want that gap to be as narrow as possible.\n\nSo if we look at Haiti, for example,\n\nyou're only expected to live to age 56 healthy,\n\nand then overall to age 64.\n\nThat's a gap of eight years.\n\nThis gap here really represents the end\n\nof life lived in less than ideal health.\n\nThat may mean something as little as difficulty\n\nwith something like going up the stairs,\n\nall the way to being bedridden.\n\nIt does affect how long you could work, for example.\n\nHow many years would you live healthy after retirement?\n\nCould you have actually retired later?\n\nThat's something that's really relevant\n\nto all these countries as their populations age.\n\nSo Haiti's at one end of the spectrum,\n\nJapan's at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nThey could expect to live longer in good health, to age 74,\n\nand then overall to age 84.\n\nNow that's a gap of 10 years.\n\nThe United States, though, is an outlier\n\nbecause our gap between healthy years lived\n\nand overall years lived is 12 years.\n\nSo that means the average American lives the end\n\nof their life many more years less than ideal health\n\nthan somebody in, say, even Bangladesh,\n\nwhere it's only 10 years, or in Canada, where it's 11.\n\nSo when I think about how well will the US fair\n\nas its population ages, I really worry\n\nbecause it is very expensive to be sick\n\nin the United States of America.\n\nThere's some real dings to the economy in our future\n\nif we have this kind of gap,\n\n12 years between our healthy life expectancy\n\nand our overall life expectancy.\n\nNewGuyUserName1:\n\nWhat's the most populous country on Earth?\n\nWell, the most populous country on Earth is India,\n\nand the second most populous is China.\n\nBoth of them have about 1.4 billion people.\n\nFar below that comes the United States,\n\nfollowed by Indonesia and Pakistan.\n\nIf we count up the most populous countries, those five,\n\nplus if we add in Nigeria and Brazil,\n\ntogether, those would make up a little over half\n\nof the world's population.\n\n@aroyaliota: So how did China's one-child policy work out?\n\nSo the one-child policy from 1979\n\nwas a law the Chinese government put in place,\n\nsaying that mostly everyone could only have one child.\n\nNaturally in a population,\n\nthere are about 105 boys born for every 100 girls.\n\nThat's just the way that it happens.\n\nSo that's represented by this orange line here.\n\nAnd because there are really strong norms\n\nof male preference, of son preference in China,\n\nmost of these families wanted to have a boy.\n\nAnd that's why, when you have restriction to just one child,\n\nand your first child is a girl,\n\nwe see that those that did have a second or third child,\n\nyou know, maybe those who were part\n\nof ethnic minority populations\n\nthat were exempt from this one-child policy,\n\nthose second and third children had far more skewed\n\nsex ratios at birth,\n\nand that is because of sex-selective abortion.\n\nNow, when I was born, which was more that way,\n\nthere were no ultrasound technology.\n\nLike, my parents would not have known if I was a boy\n\nor a girl before I came out.\n\nThese folks here, they could see in utero whether\n\nor not this child would be a boy or a girl.\n\nAnd many of them, as we see,\n\ntook measures to make sure that they would have a boy.\n\nSo when we're looking at a sex ratio at birth\n\nfor the third baby born, somewhere here,\n\naround just a little bit before the year 2000,\n\nthere were nearly 160 males born for every 100 females born.\n\nA tremendously skewed sex ratio at birth,\n\na lot different from the natural sex ratio of 105 males born\n\nfor every 100 females.\n\nIf these were people who were born just\n\nbefore the year 2000,\n\nthey are now entering their late 20s.\n\nAnd that means that there are millions more males\n\nthan there are females of these different ages.\n\nSo China is already a country\n\nwith well below replacement fertility rates\n\nin a rapidly shrinking population.\n\nIt certainly does not help the population grow any faster,\n\nthat there are millions of missing females\n\nof reproductive ages\n\nthat would have been born without the one-child policy.\n\nAClodd asks, What change in demographics\n\nare you concerned about?\n\nOne trend that people are concerned about\n\nis a youthful population.\n\nSo this would be one where a huge proportion\n\nof the population is of younger ages,\n\nthink children or teenagers.\n\nA place like Niger or Mali,\n\nhaving some of the youngest populations in the world,\n\nthey are at a greater risk of having coups,\n\nmore political instability.\n\nBut there are also opportunities associated with these types\n\nof youthful populations.\n\nWorking-age populations are shrinking,\n\nso a youthful population actually has lots of opportunity\n\nfor economic growth.\n\nWholesome_ecoli asks, What does demography mean?\n\nAt the broadest level,\n\ndemography is just studying human populations.\n\nWe're thinking about those human population changes.\n\nAnd with those,\n\nthere are just three ingredients to think about:\n\nfertility changes, mortality changes, and migration changes\n\nor shifts in births, deaths, and migration.\n\nThose in different combinations give you different outcomes\n\nand gives us a lot to study.\n\nKiwi75 asks,\n\nLet's look at which countries are growing fastest.\n\nGrowing economy is what we need.\n\nThe two fastest growing countries are South Sudan\n\nand Chad, whose populations are growing at about 6% a year.\n\nSouth Sudan and Chad are in Africa,\n\nand Sub-Saharan Africa is a region of the world\n\nwith the highest fertility rates.\n\nAnd so, one out of every four children in the world\n\nwill actually be African by the year 2050.\n\nThat's because fertility rates are lower in other regions\n\nand they're higher in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNorthern Africa, however,\n\ndoes actually have lower fertility rates.\n\nIf we think about what would make a population grow,\n\nit's having lots of people of reproductive ages\n\nand a high number of births per person.\n\nOver half of the world's projected population growth\n\nbetween now and 2050 will come from just eight countries.\n\nNow, that includes India,\n\nwhich, interestingly enough, is a country\n\nthat has below replacement fertility rate,\n\nfewer than two children born per woman on average.\n\nSo why is it still growing,\n\nand why is it contributing so much\n\nto world population growth?\n\nThat's some momentum of the past.\n\nThose cohorts of women\n\nof reproductive ages are larger from when fertility rates\n\nwere higher in the past.\n\nSo the average number\n\nof children born per woman is smaller now,\n\nbut there are a lot of those women.\n\n@MisaAlekseev: Why do Latin American migrants\n\nto the United States have such a high birth rate?\n\nAfter all, their birth rate is low in their homeland.\n\nOr Latinos come to the United States\n\nwith a very high total fertility rate?\n\nWell, you're right that, actually, in the homeland,\n\nthose fertility rates are lower.\n\nIf you look at this map,\n\nthose blue countries represent the two thirds\n\nof Latin American countries\n\nwith below replacement fertility, so below two.\n\nEven these handful in gray that are above,\n\nthey're not that far above, like Bolivia,\n\nthe total fertility rate of 2.5 children born per woman.\n\nThink about someone who comes to the United States\n\nas an immigrant.\n\nThey're typically of working ages, which also means\n\nthat they're typically of reproductive ages.\n\nIt just so happens that they're of those ages\n\nwhere they're more likely to have children.\n\nSo it's not really true\n\nthat they have such a high birth rate,\n\nit's just true that they tend to come of ages\n\nwhere they are more likely to be having children.\n\nWe also know that when people stay in a country,\n\nwhen an immigrant stays in a country, very quickly,\n\nthe norms shift to match that of the reproductive norms\n\naround the native-born population.\n\nSo within a generation,\n\nyou usually see those immigrant fertility rates come\n\n[swishes] right down to where the native-born population is.\n\n@_Jan_P: How are illegal immigrants counted?\n\nWell, first we want to think about how anybody is counted.\n\nIn the United States and many other countries,\n\nthere is a census around every 10 years or so.\n\nBut along the way, in between those times,\n\nwe have regular surveys, like the Current Population Survey\n\nor the American Community Survey.\n\nAnd so you can kind of put these together to get a snapshot\n\nof what the population would look like.\n\nIf you want to know how many illegal\n\nor irregular immigrants there are in a population,\n\nyou would take the number of legal migrants that you know,\n\nand then you would take what you know from these censuses\n\nabout how many people are in an area,\n\nand this residual or this difference is the estimate\n\nof those people who are here outside the legal system.\n\nAnd it is estimate.\n\nSome people don't answer.\n\nSometimes you can think about somebody\n\nwho is in the country illegally,\n\nlives in a household with people who are there legally.\n\nAnd so the head of household might fill out the census\n\nand say how many people are living there,\n\nbut it doesn't quite track with how many people are\n\nin the area that you know through legal immigration means.\n\nAnd so you can kind of look at those leftover numbers\n\nto estimate that.\n\nWe always take these with a grain of salt,\n\nbut demographers do use all their context clues\n\nand use all the data to try to estimate that.\n\n@WeeklyHumorist: A new study says that in the future,\n\nmost of the world will live in mega cities\n\nand their office will be in any of the windows stools\n\nat Starbucks that can reach an outlet.\n\nWell, this is certainly what sci-fi would tell us\n\nabout mega cities, which is amalgamations\n\nof population in areas of 10 million or more.\n\nI don't necessarily think it's the case,\n\nbut it will depend on where you are in the world.\n\nI mean, there's countries like Bangladesh, for example.\n\nThey just, frankly, don't have any extra space,\n\nso we do see really densely populated areas.\n\nThere are people who are leaving rural areas for urban areas\n\nto seek better economic opportunity.\n\nYear 1800, for example, only about 3%\n\nof the world's population lived in urban areas.\n\nNow we have over 58%\n\nof the world's population living in urban areas.\n\nSo generally, there is a trend\n\ntowards moving in that direction.\n\nWe also see the opposite.\n\nWe had seen during the pandemic,\n\nsome people leaving those urban cores for smaller cities\n\nor suburban areas.\n\nTBD on how that shakes out in the future.\n\n@RodT3: How do mortality rates\n\nin the US compare to other countries?\n\nSo with that, you're asking about the number\n\nof people dying per 1,000.\n\nSo if you're Japan, you would have a higher mortality rate\n\nbecause you have a lot of older people than maybe a country\n\nthat actually has a less healthy population.\n\nI bet what you really want to know about is life expectancy,\n\nespecially life expectancy at birth.\n\nHow many years would a person born today\n\nbe expected to live?\n\nAnd in the United States,\n\nlife expectancy at birth is about 78 years old.\n\nEven Canada, our neighbor to the north,\n\nhas a life expectancy at birth of 82 years.\n\nSo US life expectancy has not really been keeping pace\n\nwith increases the way that we would expect it to,\n\nand that's because health in the US is, frankly, really bad.\n\nAnd in terms of access to healthcare,\n\nthat can be really uneven from rural to urban areas\n\nor by race as well.\n\nA non-Hispanic Black woman in the United States is three\n\nand a half times more likely to die during pregnancy\n\nor shortly thereafter than a non-Hispanic white woman.\n\nSo all of these things combined,\n\nthe opioid crisis, another factor in there,\n\nthese drive US life expectancy lower.\n\nFrom Reddit: RoninSolutions says,\n\nUkraine's population is nose diving.\n\nCan anything be done?\n\nHow can Ukraine build a future\n\nin the face of ominous population statistics?\n\nThat's a great question.\n\nAbout 10 million people have left since the war started,\n\nand this is a country that already had a history\n\nof immigration or emigration,\n\npeople leaving for opportunities in Western Europe,\n\nfor example, for work.\n\nIt's also a country that already had well\n\nbelow replacement fertility rates.\n\nSo with fewer births and lots of people leaving,\n\nthey are having a serious situation with a population\n\nthat is shrinking,\n\nand there's not really much that can be done about it.\n\nWe know from countries around the world,\n\neverywhere from Germany to Canada to Japan,\n\nthat governments can play very little role\n\nin raising fertility rates\n\nthrough things like tax incentives or, you know,\n\npaying for different credits for having children.\n\nSo not much can be done on that.\n\nWhen the war ends and the country begins to rebuild,\n\nhopefully that will open up lots of economic opportunity,\n\nand the peace there will attract some people to come back.\n\nSome of those 10 million people may come back\n\nand start to build lives there.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nI hope you have seen that demography\n\nis a really powerful lens\n\nwith which to view this complex world of 8 billion people.\n\nThanks for watching Population Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm cult deprogrammer Rick Alan Ross.\n\nLet's answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Cult Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@joysfree11 asks, What are the signs I'm in a cult?\n\nSocial isolation, being cut off from family\n\nand old friends, unable to ask critical questions\n\nregarding the leader of the group or the group's behavior.\n\nA feeling that if I leave, I must be wrong.\n\nAnd there's just no checks and balances\n\nto the leader's power,\n\nor transparency regarding the group's finances\n\nand many of its actions.\n\nIf you begin to get that kind of gut feeling\n\nthat you're in a cult, maybe you are,\n\nand it's time to take a step back, unplug,\n\nand look over those warning signs.\n\n@creation247 asks, What makes a cult, a cult?\n\nThere are three primary core characteristics\n\nthat form the nucleus for virtually any definition\n\nof a destructive cult.\n\nNumber one, that there is an absolute totalitarian leader\n\nthat is the defining element and driving force of the group.\n\nAnd that leader becomes an object of worship.\n\nNumber two, the leader uses identifiable techniques\n\nof coercive persuasion to gain undue influence.\n\nAnd number three, having acquired undue influence,\n\nthe leader uses it to exploit\n\nand do harm to his or her followers.\n\nIt's important at this point to understand\n\nthat not all cults are religious.\n\nFor example, Charles Diedrich led a group called Synanon,\n\nwhich was a drug rehabilitation community.\n\nIt wasn't about religion,\n\nbut Diedrich had absolute power and control.\n\nA corporation like Apple could be seen as a cult,\n\nbut a benign cult.\n\nSteve Jobs, when he was alive,\n\nwas the defining element and driving force\n\nof the corporation.\n\nThe followers of Taylor Swift can be seen\n\nas a cult following,\n\nbut Taylor Swift is not using coercive persuasion\n\nto gain undue influence over her following.\n\nIn the case of North Korea,\n\nthe leader is worshiped as a virtual god on earth,\n\nand he is the defining element\n\nand driving force of the entire country.\n\nAnd the people are locked in a kind of social isolation.\n\nThere has been starvation, deprivation.\n\nSo I see North Korea as an example\n\nof how an entire country can become a destructive cult.\n\nnoseypeach5 asks, Can a family be a cult?\n\nYes, there can be family cults,\n\ntypically being dominated by a father figure\n\nwho has absolute control over the family,\n\nwho literally never lets his children grow up.\n\nThey stay in the family, they work,\n\nbring their paychecks to the family leader,\n\nand the marriages and the dating\n\nand everything is controlled\n\nby that parent who leads the family cult.\n\nA cult only requires at least one follower.\n\nSo you can have an abusive controlling relationship,\n\nwhere the abusive partner is in the role of a cult leader.\n\nFor example, Tina Turner and Ike Turner.\n\nTina Turner was isolated.\n\nShe was cut off from friends, until she finally left.\n\n@bug_hates_hugs asks,\n\nWhy do cults believe the end is near?\n\nIf I had a cult, I'd just be like,\n\n'Let's all just have fun,\n\nI don't know when the end will be.'\n\nThat's an interesting thought.\n\nBut if you're a cult leader,\n\nwhat you're looking for is a leverage point.\n\nSo if you tell people that the end is near,\n\nand the only safety they can be sure\n\nof is within your group,\n\nyou now have a means to get them to cleave closer to you.\n\nSo doomsday becomes a coercive persuasion technique.\n\nAn example of a doomsday cult would be the Waco Davidians,\n\nled by David Koresh.\n\nKoresh said that the end was eminent,\n\nthat he would judge the world,\n\nand that only those that were with him,\n\nin what was at one time called Ranch Apocalypse,\n\nwould be safe.\n\nWhen I did deprogrammings of Waco Davidians,\n\nthey were frantic at times to get into the compound\n\nto be with Koresh so that they would be protected.\n\nThey made weapons illegally in the compound,\n\narming themselves to defend themselves\n\nagainst what he said was Satan.\n\nThe compound was rated by the BATF,\n\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,\n\nand there was a shootout.\n\nPeople died.\n\nThe FBI encircled the compound. There was a 51-day standoff.\n\nDavid Koresh decided it was time for the end,\n\nand the place was burned down.\n\nAll the members, dead.\n\n@eastofthewood asks, How are cults different,\n\nin any way, from religion?\n\nFirst of all, religious organizations typically have\n\ndemocratic governance, checks and balances,\n\ntransparency, and accountability.\n\nYou are not made to feel that you've turned\n\nagainst God simply by leaving a particular church.\n\nIt has been said that religions began as cults.\n\nAnd in some sense you can see that,\n\nin the case of the Mormon Church or Jehovah's Witnesses\n\nor Seventh-day Adventism.\n\nIt began with an absolute charismatic leader\n\nthat was the defining element\n\nand driving force of the group.\n\nIf we look at Mormonism,\n\nwe see that first there was Joseph Smith,\n\nthen there was Brigham Young.\n\nBut over a period of time,\n\nthe group evolved beyond that point,\n\nto governance of many people,\n\nand the group moved closer and closer to the mainstream.\n\n@msresii asked,\n\nDo cult leaders know they are cult leaders?\n\nA cult leader can be seen as very much like a conman,\n\nexcept they run the same con\n\non the same people indefinitely.\n\nDo they know that they're manipulating?\n\nYes, I think they do.\n\nBut they feel that anything they do is justified.\n\nThe ends justify the means,\n\nand they determine what ends are just.\n\n@mariasghost asks,\n\nWhich cults have a good online presence?\n\nMight [beep] around and get indoctrinated.\n\nAll of the major groups have an online presence.\n\nThey have YouTube channels.\n\nThey have followers on Twitter/X.\n\nThey have Facebook pages.\n\nThey have search engine optimize themselves\n\nso that they will insinuate themselves in searches.\n\nPeople can become completely indoctrinated in a cult\n\nwithout ever meeting the leader.\n\nThey can do this by watching the leader's YouTube videos\n\nand communicating with people online.\n\nOne example of a well-known cult online would be\n\na group called the TikTok Cult.\n\nThey follow a minister by the name of Shinn,\n\nwho put together a church online,\n\nand according to complaints,\n\nexploited people who are dancers\n\nin the entertainment industry\n\nto create very popular clips for TikTok, to make money.\n\nAnd they would actually live in a community,\n\nin group housing, and be controlled by this group.\n\nBut everything would be based on\n\nwhat they were doing, in large part, online.\n\n@skinthefool says,\n\nI still think about the scene in 'Midsommar.'\n\nThe Harga women surrounding and holding Dani\n\nand wailing with her in empathy, sharing her pain.\n\nSo beautiful, yet so horrifying.\n\nI've seen Midsommar,\n\nand I would say that it's really not about empathy.\n\nIt's about quelling Dani's feelings.\n\nThe group wants to essentially anesthetize her\n\nso that she no longer will be a problem.\n\nSo by surrounding her, they have encapsulated her,\n\nand it's almost as if they're saying,\n\nDani, you no longer have your own individual feelings.\n\nThere is just the group.\n\nI think the best film that you can watch\n\nto see how cults really work is a 2011 film,\n\nMartha Marcy May Marlene.\n\nIt directly mirrors what it would be like to be in a cult\n\nand leave a cult, and how difficult the recovery might be.\n\n@grgsvo asked, How do cult leaders get people\n\nto believe they are god-in-the-flesh,\n\nwhen I can't get my children\n\nto wear shoes when they leave the house?\n\nIt's all about cutting people off\n\nfrom any outside frame of reference\n\nor accurate feedback about what's going on.\n\nWhen was the last time that you were in a theater\n\nand there was a standing ovation,\n\nand you sat and did nothing?\n\nDidn't the people around you cause you\n\nto stand up and clap too?\n\nWell, that is what goes on in cults,\n\nonly on a much more intense level.\n\nI have met cult leaders face-to-face,\n\nsome of them quite charismatic, others really not at all.\n\nBut what they all share in common\n\nis that they are malignant, narcissistic people.\n\nI feel like I'm meeting the same person over and over again\n\nbecause their personalities are so similar.\n\nChoiceCheck3900 asks,\n\nDo cults recruit based on appearance?\n\nI think I was recruited because, to be blunt,\n\nI'm ugly as [beep],\n\nand people probably think I'm easy to extort from.\n\nTypically, what cults want are people that are healthy,\n\nrelatively young, that can work for the group.\n\nThey're not interested in anyone based on appearance\n\nother than are you able to produce for the group.\n\n@MxHedroom asked, Why do all cults get so weird\n\nand crazy about sex?\n\nWell, not necessarily all of them.\n\nSome of them may demand celibacy.\n\nMarshall Applewhite, Heaven's Gate,\n\nthe people were celibate,\n\neven castrated to ensure that celibacy.\n\nBut sex is power.\n\nAnd in many groups,\n\nthe leader will use sex to control people.\n\nAnd much like a rapist,\n\nhe will dominate members of the group sexually.\n\nCharlie Manson did that. David Koresh did that.\n\nIt wasn't about sex, it was about power and control.\n\n@jeudikale asked, Is there a cult that isn't problematic?\n\nMy favorite example is Arcosanti.\n\nThis is an experimental city/community being built north\n\nof Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nAnd it was initially led by the architect Paulo Soleri,\n\nwho was the driving force and defining element\n\nof what he called arcology,\n\na philosophy based on building cities\n\nwhere there was no urban sprawl.\n\nAnd I think that Paulo Soleri meant to be good.\n\nI received no complaints about him over the years,\n\nand when he died,\n\nhe left everything to a foundation\n\nto continue to build Arcosanti,\n\nwhich is known for its famous Cosanti bronze bells.\n\nArcosanti is really an example of what can be seen\n\nas a benign cult,\n\na personality-driven group that does no harm.\n\n@MatBurnz asks,\n\nCan Trumpism as a whole be considered a cult?\n\nWell, I don't think so. It's a political faction.\n\nAnd I think that for us\n\nto use the word cult in a derogatory sense,\n\njust to denigrate some group,\n\nis an abuse of using that word.\n\nHe could be seen as a very shrewd salesman,\n\nwho has honed a message that appeals\n\nto a large group of people.\n\nThose people already had those beliefs and concerns\n\nthat made them responsive to that message.\n\nOne time Donald Trump was on a speaking tour,\n\nand he encouraged people to get vaccinated, regarding COVID,\n\nand the crowd booed him.\n\nAnd then he walked back what he said,\n\nand the audience kind of changed.\n\nI don't know cult leaders that get booed.\n\nAnd I don't know cult leaders that walk their beliefs back\n\nand morph in order to please their followers.\n\nIt's the other way around.\n\nQanon, I think, is a destructive cult,\n\nbut it's a really strange one,\n\nin that the leader is anonymous.\n\nWe really don't know who does the Q drops.\n\nQAnon believers, I think,\n\nby the way they're embedded online,\n\nare very much in line with cult followers.\n\n@ZEBIEzebs asks, Is Scientology a cult? I don't get it.\n\nIn my opinion,\n\nScientology fits the profile of a destructive cult.\n\nI think the brilliance of L. Ron Hubbard was\n\nto create this machine filled with redundancies of control.\n\nThere's training,\n\nand then there's supervision of that training.\n\nInformation gathered on people.\n\nAnd it's very difficult for people\n\nto navigate their way out, as some celebrities have,\n\nlike Leah Remini or Lisa Marie Presley.\n\nOne of the things that Scientologists believe is\n\nthat there are people called SPs, suppressive persons.\n\nThose are people that are trying\n\nto suppress your road to success.\n\nIf someone is an SP in your life,\n\nyou may be asked to disconnect from them.\n\nAnd this is Scientology's way\n\nof controlling social interaction,\n\nby declaring people SPs, by also saying,\n\nWell, this person is a potential trouble source, a PTS.\n\nHubbard really established a model\n\nthat would be copied by many people\n\nthat have been called cult leaders\n\nto perpetuate their own control\n\nover their respective groups.\n\n@bestofluckesha asks, I really want to know\n\nwhat makes America so unusually susceptible to cults.\n\nWell, nothing really.\n\nI mean, cults are a global phenomenon.\n\nThey're in Asia, they're in the Middle East,\n\nthey're in Europe.\n\nBut I think what makes the United States unique\n\nis the protection that we afford groups\n\nthat claim to be a religion.\n\nWe in the United States have the First Amendment\n\nto protect religion,\n\nand groups called cults have used that protection\n\nin a way that benefits them.\n\nYou get 501c3 tax-exempt status.\n\nWhat groups understand is that if I set up shop in the US,\n\nI can make money and have very little accountability.\n\nIt's been reported that L. Ron Hubbard once said,\n\nIf you really want to make money, start a religion.\n\nAt any rate, Scientology didn't start out\n\nas a religion but became one.\n\n@mankattan asked, What is the craziest cult\n\nyou've ever learned about, famous or not?\n\nThis guy. Marshall Applewhite.\n\nHis students were discipled by him to believe\n\nthat he was essentially the reincarnation\n\nof an extraterrestrial being that would take his people\n\nto a kingdom beyond this world.\n\nAnd they were sequestered,\n\nheld within a mansion in southern California,\n\nwhere he controlled their every move.\n\nWhat they wore, their haircuts.\n\nHe himself castrated himself\n\nand encouraged other members to do the same.\n\nAnd a number of the male members were castrated.\n\nMarshall Applewhite told his followers\n\nthat the end of the world was coming\n\nand that they had to prepare for it.\n\nBut what really probably caused the end was the death\n\nof his beloved Bonnie Nettles.\n\nWhen she died, he felt that he had nothing left to live for.\n\nUltimately, they all died together at his orders;\n\nthere were 39 bodies found in shrouds in this house, dead.\n\n@andreawaves asked, A friend has a loved one in a cult,\n\nand we are at a loss for how to help this person,\n\nand there aren't super clear steps.\n\nHave you helped someone leave a cult? Do you have advice?\n\nI've done over 500 interventions\n\nto get people out of destructive cults.\n\nFirst of all, in responding to someone who's involved,\n\ndon't be critical.\n\nDon't have arguments with them.\n\nDon't say, Oh, you're in a cult,\n\nbecause the group may coach them to cut off communication\n\nwith you if you do that.\n\nSo instead, be a good listener.\n\nAnd also, keep your lines of communication going.\n\nLet them know that you care about them.\n\nNow, an intervention may be the way you go eventually,\n\nbut initially it's important\n\nto find out more about the group, the leader,\n\nand what's actually going on.\n\n@call_me_Deeee asked, So how does cult deprogramming work?\n\nCan we get started now?\n\nA deprogramming begins as a surprise.\n\nSomeone comes to visit with their family.\n\nThere's some type of get-together.\n\nIn the beginning, the person may be rather upset about that.\n\nWhy did you not tell me this was coming?\n\nWell, the reason is because then you would share that\n\nwith other people in the group,\n\nand they very likely would keep you from participating.\n\nYou're asking them to unplug\n\nfrom the group during that period of time,\n\nwhich means all electronic devices,\n\nall access to the internet, no texting with other members.\n\nThere are four blocks of conversation\n\nin a cult deprogramming intervention.\n\nThe first one is defining what is a destructive cult,\n\nand looking historically back to, say,\n\nterrible cult tragedies in which people died,\n\nand then saying, What do all of these groups share\n\nand have in common?\n\nAnd how would that parallel the group that you are in?\n\nSecond, what is coercive persuasion?\n\nWhat is thought reform?\n\nAnd how do those steps parallel again\n\nto what you're experiencing in the group\n\nthat you now belong?\n\nAnd then number three, what has the group hidden from you?\n\nIs there information that the group doesn't share readily\n\nthat you should know to make a more informed decision\n\nabout continuing in that group?\n\nAnd so then I present research\n\nthat I've gathered about the group's history:\n\nits finances, lawsuits for personal injuries,\n\ncriminal complaints, et cetera.\n\nAt the end of a cult intervention,\n\nwhich could last three to four days,\n\nthe person who is the focus\n\nof the intervention will make their choice:\n\nto continue with the group,\n\nnot to continue with the group, to take a break.\n\nThat's up to them.\n\nAbout 70% of the people I work with will decide\n\nto take a break or leave the group completely.\n\n@EkomsPark says,\n\nSomewhere, in some random Airbnb,\n\nsome cult is about to do some weird [beep] today.\n\nWelcome to the world online that cults often populate.\n\nThere is an example of a cult leader using an Airbnb\n\nto create a cult compound.\n\nEligio Bishop had a group called Carbon Nation.\n\nHe had 35,000 followers on Twitter/X alone.\n\nHe also was on Facebook.\n\nHe would create compounds by booking Airbnbs online\n\nand then reel people in.\n\nThese would be located in relatively isolated places,\n\nin Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico.\n\nEventually, he would be prosecuted in the United States\n\nfor rape and unlawful imprisonment,\n\nand he's now serving a life sentence\n\nwithout parole in Georgia.\n\n@606_hae asked, Now,\n\nhow did Mother God even accumulate followers?\n\nLike, other cults seem at least somewhat convincing.\n\nWhen Mother God, who I knew as Amy Carlson, died,\n\nshe had hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash\n\nand probably over a million dollars in real estate holdings.\n\nHow did she do it? The internet.\n\nShe had followers online through social media.\n\nShe would stream online, which would garner attention.\n\nAnd then she had a small group that was devoted to her,\n\nthat lived with her.\n\nIt was the inner circle that really was being abused,\n\nnot the people that were online.\n\nThey were, if you will,\n\nthe cash flow that provided her with money\n\nin which she could buy property and finance her group.\n\nHow could they believe what Amy Carlson said?\n\nBecause they were isolated.\n\nThey were cut off from the outside world,\n\nthe immediate followers.\n\nAmy Carlson, Mother God, said that she was,\n\nin a previous life, Marilyn Monroe and other famous people.\n\nShe claimed to be God literally on earth,\n\nand that's why her followers called her Mother God.\n\n@vaporwavedad asked, When will we talk about\n\nhow astrology can sometimes be a gateway to either knowingly\n\nor unknowingly joining a cult?\n\nSome groups do use astrology.\n\nFor example, the Kabbalah Centre.\n\nThey will do astrological charts in an effort\n\nto influence people and how they view the world\n\nand what they do in the future.\n\nAnd they will base that chart\n\non what they know about the individual,\n\nwhich will make the person feel that, well,\n\nit must be something cosmic,\n\nbecause how did they know that?\n\nBut in reality,\n\nthey know your secrets through their process of recruitment,\n\nindoctrination, and examination.\n\nAstrology is an interesting art.\n\nRead all of the zodiac signs,\n\nwhat they say about Sagittarius, Capricorn,\n\nand ask yourself, Does that apply to me?\n\nYou might conclude that they all apply to you.\n\nThe person writing the astrological chart\n\nis writing cleverly,\n\ngeneralizing and writing something\n\nthat would apply to anyone,\n\nto convince people that it has validity.\n\nBut when cults use astrology,\n\nthey use it as a mechanism of control:\n\nto persuade people that this is\n\nhow they should behave in the future,\n\nand that this is their destiny.\n\nMichy pooh wants to know, I'm sorry,\n\nbut how the [beep] are you falling for MLM schemes\n\nand accidentally joining cults in 2024?\n\nLike, what?\n\nWell, michy pooh, people don't join cults.\n\nThey join movements/groups that they think are very good.\n\nAnd MLMs are pitching themselves as a way\n\nto become successful, to provide for your family.\n\nAn example of an MLM is Amway,\n\nbasically a scheme to recruit people in\n\nwho will buy product, pay money to the person above them,\n\nand it keeps going on and on.\n\nAnd what MLMs have in common with destructive cults,\n\nthough I don't consider them cults per se,\n\nis that they rely on coercive persuasion\n\nand identifiable influence techniques\n\nto gain undue influence over participants\n\nto take advantage of them.\n\nIn this case, to make money off of them.\n\nThe dream is the scheme.\n\nIt's not about the business,\n\nit's about recruiting people\n\nwho recruit people who recruit people.\n\nThe people at the top are the ones that really make out.\n\n@epcol asked, Do you think people who are susceptible\n\nto being in a cult have different brain structure?\n\nOr is it a lack of questioning attitude?\n\nGee, epcol, you're being really harsh.\n\nIn reality, it could be anyone.\n\nWhat we are dealing with are predatory groups\n\nwho target people and pull them in\n\nwithout their consent or their knowledge.\n\nBecause frequently, it's a bait-and-switch con,\n\nwhere what you think you're getting into\n\nis not what it's about at all.\n\nEric Hoffer wrote The True Believer,\n\nand he said, basically, If you're happy,\n\nyou're not up for change, but if you're unhappy, you are.\n\nWhen we're in distress, we overlook things.\n\nWe're looking for a way to get out.\n\nI have deprogrammed five medical doctors.\n\nOne was a orthopedic surgeon, another an anesthesiologist.\n\nThey were highly educated,\n\nvery knowledgeable, intelligent people,\n\nand yet they got caught in a destructive cult.\n\n@Mile_by_Mile asked, Do cults have to end in violence?\n\nNo. Most cults don't end in violence.\n\nIn fact, it's only a very small minority of groups\n\nthat become violent and have a tragic end.\n\nIn most cases, the leader just keeps making money,\n\nbenefiting from low-cost labor,\n\ndonations from people in the group,\n\nand exploiting the members.\n\nCults vary by degree in their destructiveness.\n\nBut sadly, the ones that we read about,\n\nthat we see in documentaries, are some of the worst,\n\nand some of the most violent.\n\n@alixg1 asked, Can you explain NXIVM in a tweet? Please.\n\nI don't know about a tweet, but here we go.\n\nNXIVM was a self-help company that sold courses,\n\nretreats that would take a week, two weeks,\n\nin which you were supposedly being trained\n\nto become a more successful, aware person,\n\nled by Keith Raniere, a former Amway distributor.\n\nNXIVM devolved into a stable for Keith Raniere\n\nto exploit women.\n\nAnd he created a cult within the cult that he called DOS.\n\nWomen were branded, literally, with a cauterizing iron\n\nto denote that they were sex slaves.\n\nRaniere would go to trial,\n\nand now he's serving what amounts\n\nto a life sentence in prison.\n\nI would meet him in court-ordered mediation hearings,\n\nand I can tell you that he was a strange little man.\n\nHe looked like a garden dwarf. Quite frankly, he stank.\n\nI don't know if he ever took a shower\n\nor how often he took a shower.\n\nBecause when he walked into the courtroom, he had an aura.\n\nBut it wasn't anything charismatic.\n\nIt was just a bad aroma.\n\nWhat Raniere possessed was a savant-like understanding\n\nof people's weaknesses,\n\nand how to leverage them for control.\n\nAnd through his training programs, people would confess.\n\nThey would divulge everything about themselves.\n\nBut when cults solicit confession,\n\ntypically what happens is they learn all your secrets,\n\nwhich they then can use as leverage\n\nto essentially force you to comply with whatever they want.\n\nAnd Raniere was an expert at employing confession\n\nto control his flock, which at one point was thousands\n\nand thousands of people.\n\n@missalliejean asked, Just took Bikram yoga\n\nfor the first time and maybe I joined a cult?\n\nThis man, Choudhury, founded Bikram yoga.\n\nThis is an example of an organization\n\nthat is not about religion.\n\nIt's about exercise.\n\nBut because it was controlled completely by Choudhury,\n\nand because Choudhury used coercive persuasion techniques\n\nto exploit women in the group that he sexually abused,\n\nit became known as a cult.\n\n@zsamm asked,\n\nSo I'm watching 'Escaping the Twin Flames Universe.'\n\nI'm fascinated by how easy it is\n\nto take advantage of people.\n\nDoes loneliness make people as vulnerable as poverty?\n\nWell, the Twin Flames Universe is a group led by a couple,\n\nand they say that they can find\n\nyour true spiritual counterpart.\n\nThey call that your Twin Flame.\n\nAccording to complaints from families,\n\nthey manipulate and exploit the people that become involved.\n\nIn some cases,\n\nmembers have actually changed their sex,\n\nthinking that it's the only way\n\nto find their true spiritual mate.\n\nIt's been devastating to families, and it's been coercive.\n\n@3FormsRpowrHows asks, Who are the Moonies?\n\nThe Moonies, as they have been called,\n\nare the followers of Reverend Sun Myung Moon,\n\nwho died not long ago in his 90s.\n\nAnd he created a group called the Unification Church,\n\nwhich was nicknamed the Moonies,\n\nto reflect how he was its defining element\n\nand driving force.\n\nHe claimed to be the Messiah\n\nand that he alone could bring the world to peace.\n\nReverend Moon became a very wealthy man.\n\nAt one point, Reverend Moon had a media empire\n\nthat included The Washington Times'\n\nUnited Press International.\n\nHe controlled 1/3 of the American fishing fleet,\n\nresponsible for about 50% of the wholesale sushi market\n\nin large cities like Chicago and New York.\n\nThe labor for those businesses was provided\n\nby dedicated members/followers of the Unification Church.\n\nThey would even submit in their weddings to Reverend Moon.\n\nThis is a picture of a mass wedding\n\nin which people that may not have even met each other\n\nare married by Reverend Moon.\n\nHere is a picture of Reverend Moon with his wife,\n\nwho now is the titular head of the Unification Church,\n\nwhich is managed by his children.\n\n@BenPo234 asked, Can people born into\n\nor raised in cults be deprogrammed?\n\nIt's gotta be so much harder, right?\n\nThis can be done, but it's a difficult process.\n\nChildren are dependent upon their parents\n\nto protect them and keep them safe.\n\nAnd when parents are themselves overwhelmed\n\nand controlled by a cult,\n\nwho is there to protect these children?\n\nAnd there have been many cults\n\nthat have horribly abused children.\n\nThere is a man, Paul Mackenzie,\n\ngoing through a criminal trial in Kenya.\n\nHe is responsible for over 400 deaths.\n\nAlmost 200 were children.\n\nHe told his followers in the Good News International Church\n\nthe end was near and that they needed to pray and fast.\n\nAnd they fasted to death.\n\nOver 200 children were led to their deaths\n\nby this man, Jim Jones, in 1978.\n\nHe ordered mass suicide by poisoning,\n\nand almost 1,000 people died.\n\nThere are groups that believe\n\nthat faith healing is the only answer to illness,\n\nand they prohibit their members\n\nfrom taking their children to a doctor.\n\nAs we're talking about this,\n\nthere are millions of people involved in destructive cults.\n\nAnd many of these people have children, they have families,\n\nand those children are subject to the whims of cult leaders.\n\n@PoliticalAnt asks, Is involuntary deprogramming legal?\n\nIt's only legal if it's a minor child,\n\nunder the direct supervision\n\nof a custodial parent or guardian.\n\nThere have been involuntary deprogrammings with adults.\n\nI myself participated in facilitating such interventions.\n\nHowever, the last one I did was in 1990.\n\nIn involuntary deprogramming with adults,\n\nin some extreme cases, people were picked up\n\nwhile they were fundraising or outside of the group,\n\nand then they'd be brought to a safe house,\n\nwhere the deprogramming would commence.\n\nIt can be very daunting to many families,\n\nwho feel they have no other means\n\nof helping someone they love.\n\nBut the courts have made it clear that this type\n\nof deprogramming cannot be done.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nIf you're concerned about a group, be careful.\n\nDon't just believe what you're being told.\n\nAnd if you're a family\n\nthat is concerned about someone in a cult,\n\nkeep your communication open.\n\nMake sure that they know you're there for them\n\nand that you love them.\n\nDon't think that it can't happen to you.\n\nUse your critical thinking and your ability to research\n\nand protect yourself.\n\nThanks for watching Cult Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm historian Angus Konstam.\n\nLet's answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Pirate Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@str8grubbin asked, Where did the pirate accent come from?\n\n'Cause there's no way in hell\n\nthat people really talked like that.\n\nIt was invented by the actor Robert Newton\n\nwhen he did the Walt Disney film Treasure Island\n\nback in 1950.\n\nHe used his native Somerset accent and embellished it a bit,\n\nand that created the sound of the pirate, essentially.\n\nHardly worth dividin', is it, George?\n\nIt's a great accent, but it's just one actor's view\n\nof what a pirate would sound like.\n\nPirates would've come from just about any port\n\nin Britain or Europe, or even Colonial America.\n\nWhen Robert Newton chose that accent, he'd no idea,\n\n60, 70, 80 years later, people are using it\n\nas the established pirate accent.\n\nThank you kindly, doctor. You came in the nick of time.\n\nIt shows you the power or the impact\n\nof that film at the time\n\nand how it captured people's imaginations.\n\nAt @Corbienest asks, Why are pirates called pirates?\n\nPirates really comes from a Greek word\n\nwhich means to attack or to rob.\n\nPirates existed as far back as the Ancient Egyptians,\n\nand then when the Romans came along, there were,\n\npeirates essentially meant a sea robber.\n\nThey had whole naval patrols out\n\ntrying to hunt down pirates.\n\nFamously, Pompey the Great organized a sweep\n\nthrough the Mediterranean\n\nto capture all the pirates he found.\n\nAnd they were using the term then,\n\nso it's kind of stuck.\n\n@LukaDonMuse says, What's your favorite rule\n\nof the pirate code?\n\nWe have a few examples of pirate codes.\n\nNow, they're really codes of conduct within the ship\n\nto govern how the pirates operate on board the ship.\n\nI like the fact that they're very democratic.\n\nFor instance, how any plunder is held\n\nin common by the pirates and divided up.\n\nThey also have ones that give you an idea\n\nof what life was like on board,\n\nbasic things like no candles\n\nwhile you're gambling and drinking blow decks.\n\nThat's a very sensible one.\n\nKnock over a candle in a wooden ship,\n\nand all hell breaks loose.\n\n@shawmrome1 asks, What do pirates do for fun?\n\nWe don't know an awful lot about what pirates did on board,\n\nbut we have a few records from merchant captains\n\ntaken prisoner and held on board pirate ships.\n\nThere was a lot of card playing\n\nand an awful lot of drinking.\n\nPirates, essentially, every time\n\nthey looted a ship with drink on it,\n\nthey would lay into the stuff.\n\nShips carrying things like Madeira wine\n\nwas regularly imported to Colonial America.\n\nPirates were well-stocked with drink.\n\nBut also an awful lot of just lying around looking bored\n\nbecause they were waiting for a victim.\n\nThat involved a lot of long passages at sea,\n\ndoing very little.\n\ngr8Sambino, I wonder if pirates\n\nreally did use wooden peg legs,\n\nor is this just common folklore?\n\nThey must have gotten seriously bad splinters.\n\nOften, people with peg legs were used as kooks,\n\njust as Long John Silver was in Treasure Island.\n\nPeg legs are probably the only kind of prosthetic available.\n\nAs for splinters, yeah, I'm sure that happened.\n\n@Wheelie_Average, What's the most famous\n\nnonfictional pirate through history?\n\nThere's a lot to choose from.\n\nProbably the instant iconic pirate is Blackbeard,\n\nEdward Teach, instantly recognizable.\n\nHe did things like blockade Charleston,\n\nwhich really upset the apple cart in Colonial America.\n\nPeople didn't know where he was going to attack next.\n\nAnd for a short period, merchant ships wouldn't go to sea\n\nfor the risk of being attacked by pirates.\n\nHis parents owned a plantation in Jamaica.\n\nThey were well off,\n\nbut he got the bug when he was a privateer.\n\nHe obviously liked it, he was good at it,\n\nand so when he grabbed the chance,\n\nhe went out pirating on his own account.\n\n@Luka4337 says, Weren't pirates democratic\n\nand overthrew bad captains?\n\nPirates were very democratic.\n\nAt the time, we're speaking about the early 18th century,\n\nit was a very strained, constricted sort of lifestyle,\n\nruled by the church, ruled by laws.\n\nPirates were rebelling against that.\n\nThey were rebelling against tyrannical merchant captains\n\nwho could have them flogged\n\nor even killed without any recourse to the law.\n\nThey could vote in a captain they liked\n\nand vote out one who didn't suit their needs,\n\nand that happened several times.\n\nIf the pirates weren't happy, they'd call a meeting.\n\nAnd they would decide if the captain should stay or go.\n\nPirate captains like Charles Vane\n\nwere deposed by their crew.\n\nHe and his crew that supported him\n\nwere shoved onto this other ship\n\nand told to fend for themselves,\n\nwhile the pirates elected a new captain,\n\nin this case, Jack Rackham, and he sailed off\n\nto continue his piratical career somewhere else.\n\n@HoneyNutBerrios says, Pirates never actually\n\nmade people 'walk the plank.'\n\nThere's no real evidence that pirates ever did.\n\nIt came largely from JM Barrie, who wrote Peter Pan.\n\nJM Barrie used the whole plot device of walking a plank\n\nto add dramatic impact to his story.\n\nBecause pirates wouldn't bother sticking a plank out\n\nand making people walk it, except in fiction.\n\nNormally, a pirate would just cut your throat\n\nand throw your body overboard,\n\nand there's plenty of examples of that happening.\n\nPirates could be nasty.\n\nSome, like George Lowther, made a name\n\nfor being almost psychopathically vicious.\n\nAnd they would often pick on the captain of a ship\n\nthat they captured, as a figure of authority,\n\nand they'd often torture him just to make his life a misery\n\nbefore killing him and throwing him overboard.\n\n@rorst3 said, So you're telling me Jack Sparrow\n\nwasn't a real pirate?\n\nWell, no, he was a character,\n\nbeautifully played by Johnny Depp.\n\nHis inspiration for it was largely Keith Richards\n\nfrom The Rolling Stones,\n\n'cause he just liked that crumpled but dynamic look.\n\nJohnny Depp just took that, embellished it, and ran with it,\n\njust like Robert Newton did\n\nall those years before with Treasure Island.\n\nHe's actually basing his look not just in Keith Richards\n\nbut in real pirates.\n\nLook at the hair.\n\nThat's straight from Edward Teach, from Blackbeard.\n\nHe's got a captain's coat,\n\nthe kind of fancy coat that a pirate captain would wear,\n\nalbeit kind of shabby.\n\nThis is the sort of thing they'd steal from a boat.\n\nThe whole thing is kind of exaggerated, but underlying it,\n\nthere's a sort of real pirate look in there.\n\nAnother thing with Johnny Depp is he's always a bit drunk.\n\nPirates did steal a lot of rum from ships.\n\n@bethec0wb0ys makes a good point, and he says,\n\nHow am I supposed to pay attention in class\n\nwhen gay pirates exist?\n\nThere were gay pirates.\n\nBartholomew Roberts, probably the most successful pirate\n\nin terms of the number of ships he captured,\n\nwas definitely a gay pirate.\n\nHis partner was one of the crew and was equally ferocious.\n\nIn a very constricting society,\n\nbeing a pirate was a great place to be.\n\nYou were part of the that pirate crew,\n\nand they all looked after each other very well.\n\n@Fisherwick_PB asks a great question.\n\nWhat's the difference between a privateer and a pirate?\n\nIn time of war, governments give privateers\n\na letter of mark, basically a license\n\nto become a licensed pirate.\n\nFor instance, during Queen Anne's War,\n\nanyone could go get letter of mark,\n\nand if they had financial backing,\n\nthey could gather together a crew for a ship,\n\nbuy a ship, and go off hunting.\n\nAnytime that ship was captured,\n\nit was taken back to port and legally sold.\n\nThe government would get its cut, about 20%,\n\nand the rest was sheer profit\n\nshared between any shareholders in the enterprise\n\nand then amongst the crew.\n\nThe trouble is, when the war stopped,\n\nthose licenses were terminated.\n\nA lot of pirates had spent a lot of time\n\nlearning the skills.\n\nThey didn't want to go back to the drudgery\n\nof being a regular merchant seaman.\n\nThey decided to keep going.\n\nA pirate attacks any ship regardless of nationality.\n\nThey're just there to hunt the seas.\n\nAt about 1713, 1714, there was an immense upsurge of piracy,\n\nmainly in the Caribbean and the American seaboard,\n\nbut also over in coasts of West Africa,\n\nthe Golden Age of Piracy,\n\na modern term for a deadly problem.\n\n@Marcotix says, Why is it trying to drink off rum\n\nwhile watching 'Pirates of the Caribbean'?\n\nRum and the Caribbean kind of go together,\n\nthe main trading good\n\nof large parts of the Caribbean was sugar.\n\nSugar was used to make rum.\n\nAnd now we associate rum with pirates,\n\nlargely because they operated a lot of the time\n\nin the Caribbean, captured rum, and drank it.\n\n@CharlotteMari_ says, Get outta here with your misogyny.\n\nThere are plenty of female pirates in 'One Piece'\n\nwho were inspired by real life female pirates.\n\nThere are not many examples of female pirates,\n\nbut in the contemporary, very strict society\n\nof the 18th century,\n\nthat whole idea that women would become pirates\n\nand go to sea,\n\nthat was truly shocking and sensational, so people loved it.\n\nAnne Bonny and Mary Read were part of a pirate crew,\n\none of Captain Calico Jack Rackham.\n\nThey both dressed like men,\n\nand fought and drank,\n\nand did all the things other pirates did\n\nAnne Bonny was recruited first.\n\nShe was probably the lover of Jack Rackham.\n\nAt least that's what the records suggest.\n\nAnd then Mary Read, who was a friend of hers,\n\njoined as well.\n\nThey weren't just going along for the ride.\n\nThey were full-on cutthroat pirates.\n\nAnd they, in the last battle before they were captured,\n\nwere the only ones who were able to put up a real fight,\n\nmainly 'cause the men had all been drinking.\n\nWhen Jack Rackham's ship was captured\n\noff the western end of Jamaica,\n\nthey were taken to Port Royal as prisoners\n\nand thrown in the jail.\n\nIt was a sensation that shocked the world\n\nthat women would be pirates.\n\nAlmost all the crew were taken away and hung,\n\nbut Anne Bonny and Mary Read,\n\nthey both pleaded that they were pregnant,\n\nand they managed to throw themselves\n\non the leniency of the court, and they got away with it.\n\n@YahavSal says, How does one get an access code\n\nto become a pirate?\n\nHow do you become a pirate? You needed to be a sailor.\n\nLand lovers were of no use. Pirates were merchant seamen.\n\nIf they mutinied against a nasty tyrannical captain\n\nand took go over a ship,\n\nthat was one of the first access codes to becoming a pirate.\n\nThe other one is, once pirates were at sea,\n\nthey captured a merchant ship.\n\nThey'd often ask the crew, Do you want to join us?\n\nThat's a big step, though,\n\nbecause once they do, they couldn't go home.\n\nThey couldn't go back to their families.\n\nThat was it. They were a pirate until they died.\n\n@whalefan69 asks, What did pirates do before sunscreen?\n\nWe have accounts of them using tallow,\n\nthe stuff they used to grease ropes.\n\nThey often put that on their faces\n\nto block themselves from the sun.\n\nBut what pirates tended to do is have a very big straw hat.\n\n@fyslairby4 asks,\n\nHas any pirate treasure been found?\n\nBuried treasure, that's a modern invention.\n\nThat was a main plot in Treasure Island,\n\nwritten by Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nPirate treasure, well, there probably is some out there.\n\nIt's probably lost by accident.\n\nBecause anytime they captured a ship,\n\noften it didn't have treasure on board.\n\nThey were capturing the regular merchant ships of the time.\n\nSo they would have things like rum or sugar or clothing.\n\nThe only occasion when treasure was buried that I know of\n\nis when Captain Kidd came back to New York\n\nfrom his pirating exploits in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAnd he wasn't sure how he'd be received,\n\nso he buried his treasure on the coast of Long Island,\n\njust outside New York,\n\nand then went into the city to see the governor.\n\nIt didn't really work out for him.\n\nHe was immediately arrested.\n\nHe was interrogated\n\nand had to reveal where the treasure was.\n\nHere's one from @quora.\n\nWhat's an average pirate's life expectancy?\n\nHollywood seems to give the idea\n\nthat they can be old and grizzled.\n\nLife expectancy at the time,\n\nwe're speaking about the early 18th century.\n\nFor a seaman, it was fairly short.\n\nA lot of pirates were young, teenagers or in their 20s.\n\nYou knew you were eventually going to be captured,\n\nhunted down, and executed.\n\nSo the chances of being old and grizzled\n\nand retiring as a pirate, kind of slim.\n\n@TSMoorhouse says, I wonder why pirates\n\nare associated with parrots and what started the trend.\n\nParrots are exotic creatures. They're novelties in Europe.\n\nAny seamen in the Caribbean\n\nwould pick up things like parrots and take them home\n\nand sell them as exotic pets.\n\n@vergiloflimbo said, I wonder why\n\nthey gave Blackbeard his name.\n\nHe's not the only one with a black beard,\n\nor was he the only one at the time?\n\nHere's a picture of Blackbeard at the time.\n\nHe was described with a great big beard.\n\nHe had it tied up often with ribbons.\n\nHe also had bits of burning slow match,\n\nused to fire guns, basically burning cord,\n\nstuck under his hat to make him look more ferocious.\n\nSo he looked kind of satanic,\n\nand that's exactly what pirates wanted.\n\n@brewminate asked, What did pirates wear?\n\nWhat we've kind of established nowadays as the pirate look\n\nwas essentially not worn at the time at all.\n\nIt was created by an American artist, Howard Pyle,\n\nin the late 19th century,\n\nwho did a lot of illustrations for kids' books.\n\nBefore he did these children's books,\n\nHoward Pyle studied Spanish guerrillas.\n\nAnd he had lots of sketches of them\n\nwith headscarves, the whole look.\n\nAnd he said, right, that's a great look for pirates.\n\nHere's an example of what pirates actually dressed like.\n\nThey wore the clothes of seamen at the time.\n\nThey were, after all, sailors.\n\nSo they'd have shirts. They'd have sun hats.\n\nVery popular is the tricorn, like this.\n\nI wish these came back into fashion. I love these things.\n\nBut that's not that practical on a ship.\n\nWhat they'd often wear is something like a wooly hat.\n\nYou see them wearing little bowler hats\n\nor hats like this,\n\nsensible, comfortable clothes, even shorts.\n\n@DesertTacSol asks, What sort of weapons did pirates use?\n\nOf course, they wanted to capture a ship\n\nwithout having to fight on the decks.\n\nThere's a risk they could be killed.\n\nThe ship could be damaged that they're trying to capture,\n\nand all that plunder on board\n\nwould be lost to them if it sank.\n\nWhen pirates captured ships,\n\nthey often took the guns from it\n\nand kept them on board their own ship.\n\nSo essentially, they had the best weaponry\n\nand all that they could lay their hands on.\n\nThe main thing to stop a ship would be a cannon like this.\n\nThey normally keep the heavy guns down in the hole,\n\nwhere the ballast is,\n\nand then they bring them up when they need them.\n\nBut you also have little swivel guns like this\n\non the rails of the ship.\n\nThey're kind of anti-personnel weapons,\n\nand you would blast out musket bowls\n\nand bags of shot from these things that were designed\n\nto spray across the decks and kill people.\n\nWhen you got alongside, you needed things like these.\n\nThese are granados, essentially little metal balls\n\nfilled with explosives.\n\nLike a modern grenade, there's no pin to pull.\n\nYou just have to light the fuse\n\nand throw it and hope for the best.\n\nYou have swords, axes, pikes, boarding pikes, cutlasses,\n\nmuskets, and even long muskets like this.\n\nSo the whole range of weaponry was available to them.\n\nImissbluey says, How the hell did pirates build\n\nsuch awesome ships?\n\nWhy are criminals so creative?\n\nPirates didn't build the ships.\n\nThey stole them, much better.\n\nOften pirates would start small\n\nwith a single-mastered sloop, or even a canoe.\n\nYou would build up your crew.\n\nYou would often trade ships for bigger ships.\n\nWhat they did, though, is they embellished them.\n\nTake Blackbeard, when he captured this French slave ship\n\ncalled La Concorde of Martinique,\n\nhe took it to a deserted aisle.\n\nHe converted it to make it a better pirate ship,\n\nand that meant cutting down the decks,\n\nso it was one big platform,\n\nso the pirates could attack from anywhere.\n\nHe added more gun ports.\n\nHe essentially blinged up the ship\n\nso it was the perfect fighting platform for piracy.\n\nslmorrison9, Did you know that pirates\n\nhelped free slaves in the 1700s?\n\nI don't remember seeing that in any history books.\n\nWell, yeah, they captured slave ships.\n\nThe Caribbean was essentially an economy\n\nthat demanded the use of slaves.\n\nBut what the pirates liked was attacking them\n\noff the West African coast,\n\nbecause they had trade goods,\n\nand they often had things like gold dust on board.\n\nAnd when they did capture one with slaves on board,\n\nif there were seamen, they'd recruit them.\n\nOtherwise, they put them ashore.\n\nSo it was kind of a reprieve for people who were captured.\n\nThey managed to get a taste of freedom\n\nthanks to the pirates.\n\nOf course, being dumped on the shore\n\nwasn't the end of the story.\n\nBecause often, in West Africa,\n\nthe coastal communities were the ones\n\nwho had actually gone out as slave hunters\n\nand sold you into slavery.\n\nSo you'd probably have some other challenges to face\n\nonce the pirates have set you free.\n\nSome pirate crews, like the ones of Bartholomew Roberts,\n\nhad a lot of Africans on board.\n\nAnd a lot of them were former slaves\n\nwho decided to join the pirates,\n\nand the pirates accepted them because they could fight.\n\nAbout a third of the crew could be Africans.\n\n@edwardj61972059,\n\nWhat's the name given\n\nto the skull and crossbones pirate flag?\n\nThe original pirate flags were known as the Jolly Roger,\n\nfrom the French joli rouge.\n\nThe red is a warning sign, but so, too,\n\nis the use of skull and crossbones,\n\nhourglasses to show that your time's running out.\n\nSkeletons and skulls are signs of death.\n\nThey often have ones with pirates drinking with the devil.\n\nIt's all designed to intimidate.\n\nAnd you see a flag like that coming,\n\nit means this is the fate that's going to happen to you.\n\nWe're gonna kill you, unless you surrender.\n\n@TheVictor_2 says, Did pirates have pirate bathrooms\n\non their pirate ships,\n\nor did they just [beep] over the side\n\nwhen they were at sea?\n\nAt any ship of the time,\n\nthere wasn't really much in the way of bathrooms.\n\nThe naval word for a toilet is the head.\n\nAnd at the front end of the ship,\n\nthat tended to be the place\n\nwhere the crew would use as their bathroom.\n\nSo they did [beep] off the side.\n\n@quora makes the very sensible question of,\n\nDid pirates live in the water,\n\nor did they have homes to go to?\n\nPirates make the choice to be a pirate.\n\nYou and your pirate crew are a floating community.\n\nOnce you became a pirate, that was it.\n\nYou'd cut ties from everything you knew from society,\n\nyour family, your friends, everything,\n\nuntil either you get a government pardon,\n\nand you can walk away scot-free,\n\nor else you're captured and, usually, hung,\n\nlike Bartholomew Roberts, who was captured and killed.\n\nHis crew were taken back\n\nand tried in a mass trial and executed.\n\nThat was a signal as much as anything else\n\nto other merchant seamen not to become pirates,\n\nor else you will face the same grizzly fate.\n\n@Jeff_Gill says, Why do so many pirates\n\nhave to wear eye patches?\n\nIt's a dangerous business being a sailor.\n\nSometimes you get your eye poked out.\n\nYes, you'd wear an eye patch\n\nif your eye was damaged or knocked out,\n\nprobably not like this one with a skull and crossbones on.\n\nThat's a kind of modern bonus.\n\nThere is an idea that eye patches are useful\n\nfor saving an eye for use in the dark.\n\nIt improves your night vision.\n\nBut there's no real evidence that pirates did that.\n\nThe most likely thing is somebody's had their eye poked out.\n\nThat's all the questions for today. Thanks for watching.\n\nThis has been Pirate Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

planning support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@Mary Morse Marti, what's your thinking about\n\nhow to best accommodate electric bikes?\n\nI think they merit their own on street travel lanes.\n\nAnd I think they do too.\n\nThey are great forms of transportation.\n\nThey are the fastest growing form of transportation,\n\nbut they go very fast and they're relatively heavy.\n\nYou can't treat them just like a pedal bicycle.\n\nThere are injuries to pedestrians.\n\nWe do need to have some way\n\nof moving them at the speed they want to go\n\nin the right way.\n\nNow, will this be done by a third level\n\nof pedestrian bike, electric bike car,\n\nor what if you could have at the scale of a bike\n\nramps and flyovers, like a miniature interstate system\n\nthat would work for electric bikes?\n\nWouldn't that be pretty cool\n\nto just join our city, stitch it back together?\n\nIt's a crazy idea, but electric bikes\n\nmake us have to think outside the box.\n\nPatrick Traughber asks, how does one solve gentrification?\n\nGentrification is the process in a city\n\nwhere people who live in a neighborhood\n\nare displaced by people who come into their neighborhood\n\nwho are richer.\n\nIt's been going on for as long\n\nas there have been people in cities,\n\nbut there are things that we can do\n\nto change the equation.\n\nTypically, it's renters that get displaced,\n\nwhereas owners get to either stay\n\nand enjoy the fancier neighborhood\n\nor sell and enjoy the profits.\n\nWhat if there was a way\n\nto remove the displacement part of gentrification?\n\nWhat if when the neighborhood got better,\n\nit just added more places to live\n\nrather than taking places away from people\n\nwho are already there?\n\nFor that to happen, you of course have\n\nto build more housing that's there right now.\n\nThat means density.\n\nA lot of people are scared of density,\n\nbut density if you do it right can be pretty good.\n\nSingapore, they've got this really cool way\n\nof leaving old parts of the city\n\nthat have two, three story buildings\n\nand integrating buildings\n\nwith like 50 stories right into them,\n\nbut in a way that fits in to the street life.\n\nAnd if you do it right, the density comes\n\nwith the other big thing about great cities,\n\nwhich is diversity.\n\nIn an ideal city, you're gonna have\n\nplenty of rich people coming in,\n\nbut you also have people of all economic strata\n\nthat get to stay in the same neighborhood.\n\nThat's the future answer of gentrification,\n\nbut it's a really hard problem,\n\nbecause it really hasn't been solved.\n\nAaron Lubeck, in my opinion, more than 75%\n\nof every urban planning architecture\n\nand landscape architecture program today\n\nshould focus on sprawl repair.\n\nThat's a good point.\n\nMost of us actually live in sprawl in suburbs,\n\nso what is sprawl?\n\nSprawl is expansion without thought.\n\nHow do we change that?\n\nHow do we get it to be the 15 minute city\n\nthat the Parisians seem to be so good at?\n\nYou essentially have to retrofit an environment\n\nthat is been designed for cars\n\nin a way that economic sense and still functions.\n\nOld disused malls now become mixed use.\n\nPeople build some housing,\n\nthey turn 'em into a street.\n\nThere's a great saying, if you wanna build a great city,\n\nbuild a great street.\n\nIn some of the newer higher end developments,\n\nlike there's something called the Esplanade at Aventura\n\nin Miami, they've actually created\n\na brand new pretend street in a shopping mall.\n\nIt's not really a street that has cars or anything\n\nor traffic or any attempt to get you from here to there.\n\nIt's just a place between two stores.\n\nIt's actually physically quite pleasant to walk down there,\n\nbut it drives you nuts\n\nbecause every store is playing their own music.\n\nIf we can solve urban sprawl,\n\nmaybe we can solve the problem of too much music.\n\nReddit user asks, in what ways\n\ncan architecture urban planning\n\nreduce or even prevent crime?\n\nThe answer is it doesn't,\n\nand it's been tried all the time.\n\nWhen I was young, the answer to preventing urban crime\n\nwas to remove columns from buildings\n\nand instead just have overhangs as you walk down the street.\n\nSo bad guys couldn't hide behind the columns.\n\nArchitecture is neither the cause,\n\nnor the solution to urban crime.\n\n@Alkaline Moon asks,\n\nthe boring company sounds like a money laundering scheme.\n\nLike really, a single lane tunnel will solve traffic?\n\nThe boring company builds tunnels\n\nthat are supposed to take people very rapidly\n\nfrom point to point.\n\nSo this is kind of cheating in an urban design sense\n\nbecause you are going only from point A to point B.\n\nYou could do that with a subway train too.\n\nI have a hunch there is something far in the future\n\nthat they're preparing for.\n\nWhat I think is actually going to be\n\nthe next form of rapid transit.\n\nSelf-driving car trains.\n\nYou type in where you want to go,\n\nthey merge with other cars\n\nthat are also self-driving\n\nto go very, very fast along a route\n\nand then you split off to go to your individual destination.\n\nThis kind of combines the speed of an electric train\n\nwith the ease that we've come to expect from cars.\n\n@Basil TGMD, how do trees cool the city?\n\nOr is it just the shade?\n\nTrees are like the single greatest thing\n\nthat can happen to a city.\n\nEvery tree provides oxygen for, you know,\n\nbetween two and five people.\n\nA tree lined street can be 10 degrees cooler\n\nthan a street without trees.\n\nThink of trees as wonderful natural machines\n\nthat make every aspect of living in a city better.\n\nAre there any examples of of city planning\n\nthat didn't use trees?\n\nWell, actually, yes, there are.\n\nFor instance, in a lot of 18th century Nordic cities,\n\nyou'll see them excellently planned,\n\nbeautiful architecture,\n\nbut there'll be no trees in the street.\n\nBut you gotta remember that in the context back then,\n\n95% of the people lived in rural areas.\n\nAs cities grew, we realized the folly of our ways.\n\nAnd actually if you look at London\n\nfrom 40 years past that point,\n\nsuddenly there are trees everywhere.\n\n@Elliot, New York took centuries to build,\n\nas do most cities.\n\nWhat city was ever built\n\nbefore people were even living there in this manner?\n\nChina made several ghost cities\n\ntrying to make this happen.\n\nNow their real estate industry is collapsing.\n\nChina had the greatest spurt\n\nof urbanization the world has ever seen\n\nover the last generation,\n\nso I can see why they might overshoot\n\nthe target a little bit.\n\nBut let's get back to the fundamentals of your question,\n\nwhich is, can you build a city\n\nin anticipation of its citizens?\n\nAnd I think the answer is no,\n\nbecause citizens are who builds a city.\n\nI don't wanna live in something\n\nthat somebody else planned and built for me.\n\nYou know, a city's not a hotel room.\n\nA city is an living organism\n\nand how we change it defines us.\n\nThe best cities do grow changed by the people\n\nwho want them to be better.\n\nThey're citizens.\n\n@iptvs, what's your vision\n\nfor public transportation in the future?\n\nThe distinction we make now between public transportation,\n\nlike a public train and private transportation,\n\nlike a private car, that distinction's gonna change.\n\nWhat is a car is going to change.\n\nThey'll be shared.\n\nThey may have different forms, they'll be smaller.\n\nIt's really less self-driving\n\nthan it is self-parking cars that is the immediate future.\n\nIn a way that you can get in a self-driving car,\n\nbut then it'll go park itself\n\nwhile you enjoy the place you are trying to get to\n\nand you don't have to make room\n\nto store that car while you are enjoying the place.\n\nImagine what that's gonna do spatially to everywhere.\n\nNow suddenly you don't have\n\nto build parking right next to where you wanna be.\n\nLet the car deal with it.\n\nTigerSagittarius86 asks, 20 years on,\n\nwas the big dig worth it?\n\nYes, the big dig was very worth it.\n\nBut what is the big dig?\n\nThose of you who love Boston,\n\nbecause it was planned by cows back in the 17th century.\n\nIn the 20th century,\n\nsome transportation planners built giant highways,\n\ninterstates that just cut right across\n\nthat gentle fabric of the city.\n\nThey really screwed up the neighborhoods on either side.\n\nIn the later part of the century,\n\nsomebody came up with an idea,\n\nhey, let's take that highway\n\nthat's cutting Boston in two and let's put it underground.\n\nLet's dig a tunnel.\n\nThey called it the big dig and it's worked.\n\nYes, traffic still gets around at the capacities\n\nof the interstate, but on top you now have some new parks,\n\nyou have some new streets\n\nthat are sized more for pedestrians\n\nand you have now all that growth urban repair\n\nthat's come up and healed around what used to be a scar.\n\nSo yeah, it's been a big success\n\nand we should do more of it in other cities.\n\n@Yash90ku, what does a sustainable city look like to you?\n\nSustainability now is, it's actually more about survival.\n\nI have to think about sustainability\n\nin the context of what's called the risk equation.\n\nThe multiplication of probability times consequences.\n\nHow likely is it for something bad to happen to your city?\n\nAnd if it does happen, how much of your city will it affect?\n\nWe're seeing this every day with weather events\n\nthat are hitting cities around the world.\n\nNow, a sustainable city has got to be a resilient city.\n\nIt's gotta be a city that can survive before it can thrive.\n\n9Virtues asks, can someone explain\n\nto me why taxpayers have to pay for stadiums?\n\nThe reason why cities use taxpayer monies\n\nto fund stadiums is to increase business in a city\n\nand therefore increase taxes that come back.\n\nSay there's a part of the city that needs help.\n\nIt needs an upgrade, and a stadium downtown\n\nwill be able to attract 20, 30,000 people,\n\n200 nights a year.\n\nThey wanna spend money, they want to have a good time.\n\nThat generates growth immediately around it and it can work.\n\nWashington DC did something very successful\n\nlike that in its downtown.\n\nLet's look at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nLet's say you give somebody a billion dollars\n\nto build a football stadium,\n\nwhich is only used 12 days outta the year,\n\nand you don't put that stadium right downtown\n\nin a neighborhood where\n\npeople can build shops and restaurants.\n\nYou put it out and surround it with a giant parking lot.\n\nThat's not a good investment.\n\nThat's not really bringing a lot of money.\n\nLike anything else in in real estate,\n\nit's location, location, location.\n\nAnd cities better keep that in mind\n\nbefore they write the next check.\n\n@DietDrDazzle, whatever happened to the Hyperloop?\n\nHmm, the Hyperloop.\n\nWell, that is merely the current incarnation\n\nof something that I've been following a long time\n\ncalled magnetic levitation Transportation, Maglev.\n\nA hyperloop is a train that travels in a vacuum,\n\nwhich is contained in a tube,\n\nbut it travels on a magnetic cushion.\n\nI don't know how it's going to do in the long run,\n\nbut let's don't throw the baby out with a bath water.\n\nMagnetic levitation can get things moving very fast\n\nwith very smooth rides\n\nand very little energy per person.\n\nThe only one that's been built\n\nand is functioning on a daily basis is in Shanghai,\n\ngoing from the airport to a downtown subway stop.\n\nIt is amazing.\n\nYou're traveling 300 kilometers an hour\n\nand you don't feel a thing.\n\nIt combines the kind of hyperlocal ability\n\nto stop that a subway has\n\nwith the speeds practically of an airliner.\n\nImagine combining those two,\n\nwhat you can do in terms of linking a city\n\nor several cities together.\n\nIt's pretty powerful.\n\nJ1000C, does the Los Angeles River\n\nor other similar rivers have\n\nto be concrete for flood control?\n\nThe answer is, duh.\n\nNo, of course not.\n\nAnd who came up with this idea in the first place?\n\nOh, these are some of the legacies\n\nthat we are living through in cities\n\nfrom this kind of 1950s, say, orgy of hard engineering.\n\nThere is a big project turning it more park-like\n\nand using it as a corridor.\n\nThat's a good thing, but there's a lot of work to do,\n\nit's a big river and unfortunately\n\nits design was replicated all over the world.\n\nEven in Athens, Greece,\n\nyou know the one of the most beautiful rivers of antiquity.\n\nThat Elissonas was turned into a concrete ditch\n\nand then to add insult to injury,\n\na highway was built on top of it.\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nIf you want to control floods,\n\nyou leave room for the water to flood.\n\nThe Chinese call it a sponge city.\n\nPeople in Brazil where they had\n\nthose horrible floods recently\n\nare coming up with these great ways of figuring out\n\nwhere water would go\n\nand then turning that area into a park.\n\nParks can flood temporarily,\n\nthe water goes back down eventually.\n\nSo no, do not make your river concrete.\n\nMake your river part of an incredible park system\n\nthat on the day it floods, will save you,\n\nbut on the day it doesn't flood we'll delight you.\n\nHey, @SuperMaurice, is there a reason buildings\n\ncan't have a wind gauge type of windmill\n\nor even some form of those spinning roads signs\n\nto generate power?\n\nUse a combination of those in solar.\n\nYou know, that's a question we asked ourselves\n\nback at the Department of City Planning.\n\nHow could we change zoning restrictions\n\nand regulations to promote buildings\n\ngenerating their own power?\n\nSolar was a good one.\n\nYeah, we figured out how to do that,\n\nbut then we thought about these windmills\n\nor turbines, urban turbine.\n\nWhat happens if you put a bunch\n\nof spinning windmills on top of buildings?\n\nWe found out pretty quickly from our public outreach.\n\nWhat happens is you get eek, eek, eek, you get squeaking.\n\nUnfortunately, we really weren't able\n\nto get much enthusiasm for windmills\n\nat the scale of an individual.\n\n@OurBikeLaneNYC, can we nix parking on some streets\n\nand nix some streets on some streets\n\nand turn them into housing with bike lane\n\nand a pedestrian access\n\nlike the super blocks they have in Barcelona?\n\nThe Barcelona super blocks\n\nthey're referring to is the beautiful city in Spain.\n\nBarcelona known for its wonderful urbanism\n\nhas decided to take some blocks\n\nand bring them together\n\nso that the streets don't divide up every block.\n\nI'd like to think about this question\n\nfrom a different point of view.\n\nHow would it be if we had a street\n\nthat was different from another street right next to it.\n\nMakes me think of something I've always wanted to see\n\nin a city, which I'll call it the tartan grid.\n\nThe tartan grid is the plaid pattern\n\nthat Scottish people wear on their kilts.\n\nWhat if we had a grid system in a city\n\nthat one street was just like the streets we have now,\n\nbut the next street over changed the mix.\n\nThe car lane was really narrow,\n\nbut the bike lanes were really big\n\nand the pedestrians were even bigger.\n\nAnd then you go to the next street over\n\nand you change the mix again.\n\nMaybe we have a a lane for an electric bike\n\nand then go back and repeat the pattern\n\nby going back to the normal street.\n\nNow if you do that, you're gonna get all the benefits\n\nof different transportation balances.\n\nLet's say you're a truck driver,\n\nyou're gonna want that car street,\n\nbut if you're a bicyclist, you're gonna want that other one.\n\nIf your kids are going to school,\n\nyou're gonna want 'em to take that third one.\n\nBut they all go generally to the same place.\n\nSo you get the benefit of the network that a grid gives you,\n\nbut you get the choice of experience\n\nthis different type of street gives to you.\n\n@Ron Letsoko, why is it that every city in most countries\n\nhas a building that looks the same?\n\nDo they hire the same designer or engineer or architect?\n\nNo, they don't, but they have the same code.\n\nIt's called the International Building Code.\n\nUnfortunately, it forces everything\n\nto be kind of the same.\n\nOne of the simplest examples of this\n\nis a code provision that says you don't need\n\nto have operable windows\n\nin a commercial building, in an office building.\n\nThis leads to glass towers everywhere.\n\nThis is a movement that's been afoot a long time,\n\never since the modernist in the 1920s\n\nto kind of impose a single way of building on everywhere.\n\nI don't like it.\n\nI think places should look different\n\nand as a place grows\n\nand you build new buildings,\n\nlet's make that place be more like itself.\n\nBe more different.\n\nTo tackle that though, it's not just\n\nas easy as getting a new architect.\n\nYou're gonna have to go and examine those codes as well.\n\n@VinnyMotherland, can I ask, at what point is it okay\n\nfor a metropolitan city\n\nto simply reach a reasonable capacity\n\nand have that be an okay thing?\n\nThat is a question humanity has been trying to answer\n\nfor its entire civilized existence.\n\nWhen is a city too big?\n\nRome got to be a million people\n\nand it still wanted to get bigger.\n\nTokyo today has 30 million people,\n\nbiggest city in the world.\n\nIt doesn't seem like there are any limits maybe.\n\nI think there are, but those limits don't happen\n\nat what we call the city scale.\n\nThose limits really have to do with neighborhoods.\n\nWhat is the largest that a neighborhood can get\n\nand still be viable and pleasant?\n\nAnd then how can you stitch those neighborhoods together\n\nto create a great city?\n\nBrandon White asks,\n\nhow do most urban planners feel about Favelas?\n\nFavelas are areas, let's say in Brazil,\n\nthat are haphazardly built,\n\nthat are in a city but aren't really hooked up to a city.\n\nMany people look at them as places of crime, places\n\nto be avoided, but they're not.\n\nThey are really part of the city\n\nand they have their own form of organization.\n\nI think that the right way to think about Favelas\n\nis to look at them as one end of the urban spectrum\n\ncompared to the other end of this urban spectrum,\n\nsay a fancy shopping street.\n\nSao Paulo is sort of the king of cities in terms\n\nof the biggest Favelas and the most sophisticated streets,\n\nand people don't actually interact as much as they should.\n\nI think if people went to Favelas more\n\nand people from Favelas went to the shopping\n\nas they call 'em, you would start building that social trust\n\nthat would let people see that cities\n\ncan look different and yet still be the same.\n\n@cyclessixmile, nearly a third\n\nof downtown Detroit is parking.\n\nPerhaps just one more parking lot will fix it?\n\nYeah, just one more parking lot.\n\nWe had a bunch of walkable cities in America.\n\nIn the fifties people started tearing down the buildings\n\nand building parking lots.\n\nIt was like a, like a disease practically.\n\nIf you looked at an aerial picture\n\nof downtown Detroit in 1965,\n\nyou'd think like, oh, was this bombed?\n\nWas a pretty noxious cocktail\n\nof people leaving for the suburbs.\n\nAnd then policies meant to redevelop downtown.\n\nYou almost got government cheering people on\n\nworking the tax codes\n\nso that they would tear down their building\n\nin the hopes of some kind of renaissance center\n\nthat Detroit built relatively\n\nunsuccessfully Back in the day.\n\nThey were meant to revitalize an area, but no they didn't.\n\nSo Detroit has clawed its way back\n\nand it's a great success story,\n\nbut it's not because of the parking lot,\n\nit's because of the people moving to Detroit\n\nwith a vision of what it can be tomorrow.\n\nYoung people, grassroots,\n\nand it's still got a long way to go.\n\nThere's no question about it,\n\nbut it shows something about the resilience of cities.\n\nWe want to be there that we're working at it.\n\nChef Carpaccio, is there any way to solve\n\nthe insane rising cost of housing in NYC?\n\nUgh, it is very expensive to live in New York City.\n\nIt's been a problem for a very long time.\n\nYou open a newspaper from the 1920s\n\nhousing crisis in New York City.\n\nIt's too expensive to rent here.\n\nWe've tried everything.\n\nWe've tried building public housing\n\nat the scale of Robert Moses.\n\nAll the housing blocks that you see,\n\nwe've tried expanding into new neighborhoods,\n\nbut somehow the rent still\n\ngets to be too high for each generation.\n\nIt's a problem that seems to be part of New York's growth.\n\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of people\n\nmove to New York City searching for their dream.\n\nJust a little less hundred thousands\n\nof people leave New York City.\n\nThey've had enough that's actually very healthy\n\nfor a city if it can continue growing.\n\nNow, New York has historically had other problems,\n\nwhich we have solved.\n\nProbably my favorite is the crisis problem of 1910,\n\nwhich was there is too much horse manure in New York City.\n\nIf we can solve that one,\n\nI guess there's always hope.\n\nrr90013, how are you feeling about\n\nthe shelving of the congestion pricing plan?\n\nOne word, ugh.\n\nWe really need the money that congestion pricing\n\nwas gonna bring in to fix the subways\n\nand do all sorts of needed transit projects.\n\nCongestion pricing has worked elsewhere\n\nin several Nordic cities\n\nand probably in terms of scale closest to us in London.\n\nIt's just a way of making cars pay a bit more\n\nof their share of the overall transportation costs.\n\nBut it's a shame.\n\nWe put in all the infrastructure\n\nand then we pull back from it.\n\nDoxiadisOfDetroit asks, what were some\n\nof the dumbest proposals in urban planning history?\n\nWow, we'd be here all night\n\nif we really answered that question in its fullest.\n\nI'll class perhaps more as a failed experiment than\n\nas an outright failure is Brasilia,\n\nthe new capital of Brazil that was built in the 1950s.\n\nIf you've ever been there,\n\nit is an impossibility to walk.\n\nIt is meant to be seen from the sky.\n\nIt's meant to be photographed.\n\nIt is a monument to its architect's sense of self,\n\nbut it is a wretched city to get around.\n\nNow, being the capital of Brazil,\n\none of the great countries of the world, of course,\n\nit eventually filled up with people\n\nand now it has growth around it.\n\nBut you'll see that the little edge cities\n\nthat grow around Brasilia,\n\nlook absolutely the opposite of Brasilia.\n\nPeople are building the kinds of places\n\nthey'd really rather be in.\n\nAnd Brasilia stands as kind\n\nof a failed experiment in image making.\n\n@JBUCOBENG, how is it possible authorities\n\ncan let a city run out of water?\n\nHow?\n\nIt cannot happen if a city runs out of water, a city dies.\n\nWater is the single most important resource\n\nto have a city become livable.\n\nSo authorities have to do everything they can\n\nto provide a water supply in New York City,\n\nthere is a third water tunnel under construction.\n\nThere's an enormous upstate network\n\nto gather water and provide for it.\n\nThat's been worked on diligently\n\nfor over a century.\n\nSao Paulo had a very difficult choice recently\n\nwhen a drought drained some of their reservoirs\n\nbecause they had been using water\n\nto create electricity\n\nand suddenly they were faced with this dilemma.\n\nUh-oh, do we turn off the lights or do we turn off the tap?\n\nCan't let your city get there.\n\nAlright, that's it.\n\nThat's all the questions.\n\nHope you learn something.\n\nTill next time.\n\n[upbeat

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Nick DiGiovanni,\n\nand this is the WIRED Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe last thing I Googled.\n\nAh, I was trying to make a French omelet\n\nfor the first time.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay, first board.\n\nWhere is Nick DiGiovanni from?\n\nI am from Rhode Island,\n\nspecifically, I was born in Providence.\n\nRhode Island, you might know, is the smallest state,\n\nand it's also the ocean state.\n\nSo it's surrounded by a lot of water.\n\nAnd I think that's where my love\n\nfor seafood comes from.\n\nWhere did Nick DiGiovanni go to college?\n\nI don't know, still, why they let me in,\n\nbut I went to Harvard.\n\nI studied environmental science there,\n\nbut I also got to take a lot of classes\n\nthat had something to do with food.\n\nSo I basically took every single possible class\n\nthat I could take related to food in some way,\n\nand they actually had a lot of different classes\n\nthat were about food.\n\nI spent a whole semester just learning everything\n\nthere is to know about chocolate.\n\nWhere does Nick DiGiovanni get his knives?\n\nGreat question, too.\n\nThe tough part is I use a lot of different types of knives,\n\nbut my favorite type of knife, in general,\n\nwill be an 8-inch chef's knife,\n\nand I usually get them from two different places.\n\nOne comes from this company, a really old company\n\nthat's been making knives for a long time, called ZWILLING,\n\nand then the other more custom knives\n\nthat I use come from a knife maker\n\nwho lives in New Hampshire named Zach Jonas.\n\nHe just finds different trees, cuts out,\n\nyou know, different handles from the trees,\n\nand then basically makes all these different knives\n\nby hand and I can customize exactly what I want.\n\nThat really cool steel Damascus pattern\n\non each blade to look like.\n\nI probably have about 150 knives.\n\nI love knives.\n\nIt's kind of scary.\n\nWhere did Nick DiGiovanni go to culinary school?\n\nI didn't go to culinary school.\n\nI did do a two week long bootcamp at the CIA,\n\nnot like a special agent by any means.\n\nIt's the Culinary Institute of America\n\nand their main campus is in New York.\n\nThat's one of the best\n\nor the best culinary school in the country.\n\nBut I didn't actually go there.\n\n[board clanking]\n\nWhen.\n\nWhen did Nick DiGiovanni start YouTube?\n\nI think my first video I posted\n\nwas probably in 2019 when I finished MasterChef\n\nand then I didn't actually start making videos\n\nconsistently until I think late 2020,\n\nso it took me a little bit of time\n\nto figure out a good formula\n\nand catch the YouTube bug where I just wanted\n\nto wake up and think about it every single day.\n\nWe're definitely gonna pass 1,000 videos pretty soon.\n\nWhen did Nick DiGiovanni win MasterChef?\n\nThat's a trick question in a way,\n\nbecause I didn't win MasterChef.\n\nI got third.\n\nI was on season 10 and I got to the finale,\n\nbut then, yeah, I didn't win.\n\nNice that people think that I did.\n\nWhen did Nick DiGiovanni start cooking?\n\nI forget the exact age, to be honest with you,\n\nbut I know it was between seven and eight years old.\n\nI saw my grandmother, I saw my great grandparents cooking.\n\nI loved watching, I loved being in the kitchen.\n\nI liked the smells, the sounds,\n\njust the warmth near the stove\n\nand just being with family and having fun with some food.\n\nI was just running around the kitchen,\n\njust grabbing different things off\n\nthe counter when somebody else was cooking\n\nand just trying to eat it, helping,\n\nbut probably not actually helping,\n\nif you know what I mean.\n\nRight away, food was what I loved.\n\nWhen did Nick DiGiovanni get famous?\n\nThat's a crazy question.\n\nWhat does famous even mean though?\n\nYou know?\n\nI don't have an answer for that.\n\n[board clanking]\n\nThank you.\n\nWhat is Nick DiGiovanni favorite food?\n\nRotisserie chicken.\n\nIt's the best.\n\nI love rotisserie chicken.\n\nI oftentimes go to the market, I get one,\n\nI eat the whole thing by myself,\n\nthen I take all the bones and I make a chicken stock,\n\njust with maybe some onion,\n\nsome carrots, some celery, butter, olive oil,\n\nand a few different seasonings,\n\nand then just throw all the chicken bones in there\n\nand just slowly let it go for a while.\n\nAll covered in water.\n\nYou just make this delicious comforting broth\n\nthat I'll just take a cup all day\n\nand I'll slowly drink it until it's all gone\n\nand then I'll top it off with more water\n\nand kind of make it again, it lasts forever.\n\nOne other nice thing is that if you save the rind\n\nof your Parmesan cheese, throw that rind in there.\n\nIt gives a really nice kind of cheesy umami flavor\n\nto your stock or your broth.\n\nThat's my favorite food, because A, it's delicious.\n\nIt's fall apart tender and chicken is so good, but B,\n\nbecause I can find this really great second use for it\n\nwhere I can have this really flavor-packed broth\n\nthat I can drink for so long.\n\nWhat is Nick DiGiovanni signature dish?\n\nI would have to say my signature dish\n\nwould be a fresh handmade pasta\n\nwith some kind of seafood.\n\nIt could really be any kind of seafood,\n\nbut because I grew up in Rhode Island\n\nand there was lots of fresh seafood around,\n\nand now I live in Boston, I love a good fresh pasta\n\nwith whatever seafood I can get my hands on.\n\nOh, this is a two part.\n\nWhat camera does Nick DiGiovanni use?\n\nOkay, we use all Sony's,\n\nbut sometimes I also just pull out my iPhone\n\nand I get shots that way now too.\n\nWe've learned that it,\n\npeople are much more comfortable\n\nif there's just an iPhone filming\n\nversus a bigger camera.\n\nAnd so there are certain places\n\nand certain times where it just makes sense\n\nto pull out a phone and it's so much easier that way\n\nand it's so much more comfortable for people that way.\n\nThere's something about a camera\n\nand a lens that just scares a lot\n\nof people for some reason,\n\nwhereas they're just fine with a cell phone.\n\nWhat oil does Nick DiGiovanni use?\n\n[siren blaring]\n\nWhat is that?\n\n[siren blaring]\n\n[Speaker] That's a fire alarm.\n\nOh.\n\n[clapperboard clacking]\n\nJust set off the fire alarm and I wasn't even cooking.\n\nHow crazy is that?\n\nWhat oil does Nick DiGiovanni use?\n\nI mean, I have a bunch of different types of oil.\n\nIt just depends on the situation.\n\nIt actually took me a little while,\n\ncooking to learn what types of oils to use when.\n\nI just feel like you can really separate it\n\ninto two categories.\n\nYou have your low smoke point oils\n\nand then you have your oils\n\nthat have a high smoke point.\n\nIt's actually really easy to look up.\n\nYou can just look online.\n\nFind the smoke point of any oil,\n\nand if it's over 450, you can use that\n\nfor a super high heat steak\n\nor chicken or whatever you're doing.\n\nIf it's got a lower smoke point,\n\nthat's often not so for high heat cooking\n\nand maybe a little bit better\n\nto finish off a dish like a nice olive oil\n\non top of a salad.\n\n[board clanking]\n\nLast one.\n\nThank you.\n\nNow finally we have the how's.\n\nHow to pronounce Nick DiGiovanni?\n\nOh, we've been practicing that one the whole video.\n\nThis is funny because it's also something\n\nthat I feel like it even took me a long time\n\nin my life to figure out,\n\nbecause everybody kind of pronounces things\n\nslightly different.\n\nIf you split my last name into two different ways,\n\nit's Di-Giovanni, so that makes it easier\n\nto think about DiGiovanni if you put it all together.\n\nOkay, Nick DiGiovanni, anyone can cook.\n\nYeah, I sometimes use that little tagline\n\nthat I kind of stole from Ratatouille,\n\nbecause it's my favorite movie ever.\n\nBut I do believe it.\n\nI feel like it's true.\n\nI feel like anyone can cook.\n\nYou just need to learn some of those basics\n\nand then after that you can make anything.\n\nAnd the coolest part about it is that\n\nthere's so many different ingredients,\n\nso many different types\n\nof food all around the world.\n\nSo if different people in different places\n\nlearn those basic rules and then start experimenting,\n\nyou can come up with some really crazy things.\n\nNick DiGiovanni food hacks.\n\nI'm trying to think of a really good food hack.\n\nI will say, most pizza that I've ever had from takeout\n\nis actually better the next day\n\nif I've put it in a pan with a bit of moisture\n\nin there and a lid on and just let it kind\n\nof steam and crisp up on the bottom.\n\nThe bottom gets way more crispy\n\nthan it was the day before.\n\nAnd then the top is nice and melty and cheesy\n\nand that extra bit of crunch and crisp,\n\nI think it's better than it was when it was fresh.\n\nLast one.\n\nNick DiGiovanni Dino Nuggets recipe.\n\nGreat, great, great question here.\n\nThe key to a really nice juicy Dino Nugget\n\nis to make sure that you're putting\n\nsome milk-soaked bread in the filling.\n\nThat bread holds some of that moisture, that milk,\n\nand when it cooks, it retains all of that moisture\n\nso that when you finish the whole thing,\n\nit's got a really juicy bite to it.\n\nBut the full recipe for my favorite\n\nDino Nuggets is actually my cookbook,\n\nso if you wanna try to find that,\n\nit's all there.\n\nToss it.\n\n[board clanking]\n\nAlright, those are all the questions.\n\nThanks so much for watching.\n\n[upbeat music] [electronic tone whooshing]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHey, I'm Jimmy O. Yang\n\nand this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat electronic music]\n\nCan't say I've Googled myself.\n\nNo, actually I have actually Googled myself many times.\n\n[upbeat electronic music]\n\nAlright, very excited about this.\n\nHow did Jimmy O. Yang become famous?\n\nPeople google this? Like how did he became famous?\n\nIt's different for different people.\n\nUsually when white people come up to me,\n\nthey say, Oh, Silicon Valley, Jian Yang, hilarious.\n\nWhen Asian people come up to me, they know me from standup,\n\nthey know me from Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nA lot of immigrants come up to me, Chinese immigrants,\n\nJapanese, they're like Your standup special got,\n\nyou know, subtitle and translated in Chinese\n\nand that's how I know you.\n\nAnd a lot of times Chinese people,\n\nthey call standup comedy talk shows.\n\nThey're like, We love your talk shows.\n\nOh, and a lot of girls, younger, older\n\ncome up to me because of Love Hard.\n\nThis rom-com I did with Nina Dobrev on Netflix.\n\nSo fame is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nWas Jimmy O. Yang in Patriots Day? Yes.\n\nThat was actually one of my proudest projects to date,\n\nbased on real life movie about the Boston Marathon bombing,\n\nwhich was a very dark day in our country.\n\nAnd I get to play this character, Danny Meng\n\nthat kinda became the hero and saved the day.\n\nHe was a Chinese immigrant student and he got carjacked\n\nand kidnapped by the Boston bombers and he ran away, escaped\n\nand was able to call the cops, remember his tag numbers.\n\nAnd that's how they found the two bombers\n\nthat led to the shootout in Watertown\n\nand the capture of these bombers.\n\nSo I get to kind of talk to\n\nand interview Danny every day had a great time in Boston.\n\nAnd I thought it was just such an important story\n\nand it was the first drama I did.\n\nAnd Peter Berg was a great director\n\nand it was good to kind of prove to myself\n\nthat I could be a good dramatic actor\n\nand it gave me a lot of confidence in that sense.\n\nBut also it was just such a great story to tell.\n\nJimmy O. Yang dad joke. Who Googles that?\n\nJimmy O. Yang dad joke.\n\nI do have a lot of jokes about my dad\n\nand those have became some of the most popular jokes.\n\nAnd yeah, my dad is just naturally like a pretty funny,\n\ncharismatic person.\n\nPretty easy to make fun of.\n\nHe started acting after I did\n\nand that is true now he's a full on SAG actor.\n\nWe just recently did a commercial together. He loves it.\n\nAt times I'm like, is this kinda seeping into my life\n\na little too much?\n\nLike is he overstepping as a father? But I love it.\n\nI love it.\n\nJimmy O. Yang oh I don't know.\n\nI think that's a line maybe I said in my standup\n\nor my character Jian Yang has said on Silicon Valley.\n\nI'm not so sure how that became a top search,\n\nbut that's a really interesting phrase,\n\nbecause for every character I play on TV, on film,\n\nI try to have a mantra.\n\nRight before every scene\n\nwhen I was that Jian Yang character,\n\nI would say, I don't know in Chinese [speaking Chinese]\n\nEither he doesn't care to know\n\nor he doesn't care about these people to know\n\nor he truly is a bit lost.\n\nSo that was kind of like my mantra\n\nfor the Jian Yang character is, I don't know.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nDoes Jimmy O. Yang, sing in Love Hard? Yes, I do.\n\nThat was actually my voice. I impressed myself.\n\nI didn't think I was that good of a singer,\n\nbut it all came together pretty well.\n\nWe prerecorded the song in the studio.\n\nIt is the remix of the lyrics of Baby It's Cold Outside\n\nto a more appropriate lyrics.\n\nAnd it's me and Nina Dobrev doing a kinda duet.\n\nJimmy O. Yang economics.\n\nIs it like searching Jimmy O. Yang net worth?\n\nLike I do that all the time. My dad does that to me.\n\nHe'll be like, Oh, your net worth went up.\n\nI'm like, I wouldn't listen to any of these sites.\n\nBut Jimmy O. Yang economics,\n\nI'm pretty sure it's because I was an econ major in college.\n\nI went school in UC San Diego.\n\nI went in as a Mechanical Engineering major\n\nand I was too much of a slacker, I never went to class.\n\nI was smoking too much weed\n\nand I was like, I'm never gonna graduate\n\nas a mechanical engineer.\n\nSo I picked the easiest major\n\nthat would still appease my Asian parents,\n\nwhich was economics.\n\nJimmy O. Yang. This is a long one, it seems.\n\nDisappointing Asians.\n\nThat's not what it seems. Okay?\n\nI don't think I've disappointed any Asians.\n\nI hope I made Asians out there proud.\n\nBut this was the subtitle of my book,\n\nwhich is How to American: The Immigrants Guide\n\nto Disappointing Your Parents.\n\nI think there's a lot of jokes about me\n\ndisappointing my parents,\n\nbeing a disappointing Asian to my parents.\n\nI hope that's what it means.\n\nI hope I'm not actually out there\n\ndisappointing Asian people.\n\nI started doing standup and that's not a very Asian thing,\n\nyou know, that's not something that my parents considered\n\nas a real job.\n\nThey wanted me to be in finance,\n\nto be a lawyer doctor, like real jobs to them.\n\nSo me being a standup and actor,\n\nI disappointed them for many, many years.\n\nBut like I said in my book, to me,\n\nit was better to disappoint my parents for a couple years\n\nthan to disappoint myself for the rest of my life.\n\nSo I had to take a risk, take a chance\n\nand try something that I love.\n\nJimmy O. Yang jacket.\n\nThis became a thing the kinda light blue jacket I wore\n\non my second special, Guess How Much?\n\nIt was a really cool jacket\n\nand a lot of people start Googling where I got it from.\n\nI don't even know where I got it from.\n\nIt was a brand that my stylist, at the time,\n\nhooked me up with.\n\nAnd I think it was a Chinese brand\n\nthat has since went out of business.\n\nOf course, if there's enough demand,\n\nI think there's now a site that sells the Jimmy O. Yang,\n\nGuess How Much? Jacket, Like a bootleg one.\n\nLet's see. When did Jimmy O. Yang start comedy?\n\nI started standup comedy when I was 21 years old.\n\nJunior year of college.\n\nThis is when you could go into the Comedy Club.\n\nAnybody usually under age of 21, you have to wait outside\n\nof Comedy Club and then get in your set when it's your turn.\n\nSo it's been two years.\n\nI've only been doing comedy for two years. I'm 23 years old.\n\n[chuckling] When did Jimmy O. Yang start acting?\n\nI started acting maybe a couple years\n\nafter I started standup, probably like 15 years ago now.\n\nYeah, there's a lot of things that are similar.\n\nYou know, the charisma stage, the command of the stage.\n\nI think that translates often time on camera.\n\nStandup is a stage act and it's a vocal act.\n\nYou wanna project, you wanna touch the audience\n\nin the balcony, right?\n\nWhereas acting oftentimes, especially TV film acting\n\nis very close on your face\n\nand it's about what's going on inside.\n\nIt's a little more internal.\n\nAnd one of the things I noticed for me\n\nand many standups, the hardest part to learn,\n\nand maybe in life, is to listen to your partner.\n\nBecause standup, it's all you,\n\nyou're one person by yourself,\n\nwhereas acting it's about the connection\n\nwith you and your partner.\n\nSo I learned to be a better listener,\n\nwhich is probably good for my life in general.\n\nWhere was Jimmy O. Yang: Guess How Much? filmed?\n\nMy second comedy special called Guess How Much?\n\nit was filmed in Austin, Texas.\n\nAnd it was actually a really interesting and fun thing\n\nbecause Austin is not as Asian as most of my crowds.\n\nIt leaned more white and the cool part was\n\nthe jokes still hit.\n\nYou know, like my jokes weren't just for the Asian people.\n\nSo that felt good. I knew if that was gonna work in Austin,\n\nit was gonna work for most people in America.\n\nAnd of course it ended up working not just in America,\n\nlike around the world, a lot of it got translated to Chinese\n\nand it's played in China and Hong Kong and Taiwan\n\nand a lot of places in Asia.\n\nI got people telling me from China,\n\nthat's how they started learning English\n\nfrom my standup special.\n\nSo that felt pretty special to me.\n\nI'm breaking lights over there.\n\nJimmy O. Yang I love you.\n\nIs this just a fan hoping they'll get to me?\n\nIt says Jimmy O. Yang I love you.\n\nThat's very sweet. I appreciate that.\n\nBut I think it's actually based on one of my jokes\n\nwhere I say Asian, we don't really say I love you\n\nto our parents.\n\nThe joke goes that one time in college I got high\n\nand I called my mom, I was like,\n\nMom, I just wanna tell you that I love you.\n\nAnd then she started crying.\n\nShe was like, Jimmy, are you okay? Do you have cancer?\n\nJimmy O. Yang improv.\n\nI improvise a lot on Silicon Valley on Space Force\n\nand a lot of comedy projects I do and even dramatic stuff.\n\nYou know, we find rooms to improvise,\n\nwhich is fun and it's cool\n\nand it gets you into the character, into the story.\n\nBut also The Improv is one of my favorite comedy clubs\n\nin L.A. and all over the world.\n\nI try all my materials there before I take it on the road.\n\nAnd big shout out to Rita at The Improv,\n\nwho's been the Booker there for a long, long time\n\nand she has made a lot of people stars\n\nand given them the opportunity.\n\nJimmy O. Yang Jian Yang, that was the character\n\nI played on Silicon Valley for six seasons.\n\nI started off as just a very tiny part,\n\ntwo lines in one episode.\n\nAnd it became two lines in three different episodes.\n\nAnd by the second season I became a series regular.\n\nAnd it was a whole like villain arc with Jian Yang.\n\nAt first he started off as kinda just like a random person\n\nthat lives in the incubator, played by T.J. Miller\n\nand his character Erlich Bachman.\n\nAnd I start standing up to Erlich\n\nand we had this very cool Laurel and Hardy\n\nkind of comedy duo.\n\nAnd it was a lot of improvisation, a lot of fun,\n\na lot of great scenes that is still very fond in my memory.\n\n[whistling]\n\nJimmy O. Yang Interior Chinatown,\n\nthat is the new show I'm gonna be on.\n\nI feel like everything I've worked on,\n\nI've worked for in my career, it's all in the show.\n\nIt's really interesting.\n\nIt's kinda like Truman Show.\n\nIt's about a background actor played by me, Willis Wu,\n\nhe's stuck in a show that's similar to Law and Order,\n\nbut he doesn't know it.\n\nHe just doesn't know\n\nhow to get out of his role in Chinatown.\n\nAnd there's like a ceiling, there's a glass window,\n\nhe just can't get out of it.\n\nAt the same time he's dealing with a lot of stuff\n\nwith his family, his disappearance with his brother.\n\nSo he starts uncovering the mystery,\n\nby doing so he has to sneak in\n\nto the actual Law and Order show.\n\nSo episode by episode, he goes from a background actor\n\nto a guy having two lines to actually the tech guy,\n\nwhich is like my journey in my life too.\n\nIt's kinda like Law and Order meets Twilight Zone.\n\nWas Jimmy O. Yang in Crazy Rich Asians? Yes, I was.\n\nI played this character, Bernard Tai,\n\nthe crazy kinda billionaire playboy.\n\nAnd I had so much fun and we're still all best friends.\n\nI actually just went out to dinner with Awkwafina and Ronny\n\nand we still have a hundred people group chat on WhatsApp.\n\nJimmy O. Yang love languages.\n\nMy best love language is acts of service.\n\nYou know, I love cooking.\n\nThat's what my parents did for me, you know?\n\nAnd I love, you know, just doing things, fixing things\n\nand words of affirmation.\n\nI didn't think it was important to me, but I think it is.\n\nYou know, that's why I think I'm a standup.\n\nYou get the live audience reaction.\n\nEvery laughter is a word of affirmation for me.\n\nAnd sometimes if I don't do standup for a prolonged period\n\nof time, I don't get the immediate feedback, the accolades,\n\nI start to wilt a little bit.\n\nAnd I think that's every artist,\n\nwe want our work to be seen and to be loved.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm also learning to be a little,\n\na little self-love.\n\nThat you don't need the external validation.\n\nYou do a lot of these projects,\n\nthese art projects for yourselves.\n\nAnd if it's good enough for me, I had a great time.\n\nThat's the most meaningful part of it.\n\nJimmy O. Yang LinkedIn.\n\n[laughing breathlessly]\n\nI don't think I have a LinkedIn account.\n\nI never had a real job.\n\nMy first high school job was\n\nI worked at Big Five Sporting Goods,\n\na discount sporting goods store.\n\nI loved it. I worked there for many summers.\n\nI was a waiter for a Chinese restaurant.\n\nI was a used car salesman. I was once a strip club DJ.\n\nSo I don't think any of those things go on LinkedIn.\n\nI don't think my LinkedIn says\n\nstrip club DJ at Fantasy Showgirls in San Diego.\n\nJimmy O. Yang chicken wings.\n\nOh, I know what this is about.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I started a little cooking show\n\ncalled Jimmy's Kitchen on YouTube.\n\nAnd it was really cool actually.\n\nI get to learn how to cook with the people\n\nand then teach people some things that I learned.\n\nAnd I also got really into the food space.\n\nI wrote a quarterly column on Bon Appetit.\n\nI wrote about my hate for boneless wings.\n\nHow they're not wings, they're just little cut up pieces\n\nof white meat, chicken lies.\n\nChicken wings, if you really go for the chicken wings,\n\nget the bones, get the flavor,\n\nnot just little chunks of meat.\n\nThat's for babies.\n\nAnd then years later, recently,\n\nI did a commercial for Popeye's Boneless Wings.\n\nSo for the right price, I'm ready to sell out at any time.\n\nThat's the moral of the story.\n\nNo, it was actually, they let me try their wings\n\nand it was actually so good.\n\nI was like,\n\nYeah, sure, this is actually legit boneless wings.\n\nJimmy O. Yang Kumon.\n\nAs you know, Kumon's an afterschool kinda tutoring\n\na thing a lot of Asian people go to.\n\nI don't know if you guys have seen the Kumon logo,\n\nbut even the logo itself looks miserable.\n\nIt's just an emoji, like a two dots in a line,\n\nbut it's not even like a happy face.\n\nYou're just like, Oh, I guess I'm at Kumon\n\nand my life sucks.\n\nJimmy O. Yang, TikTok.\n\nI didn't really know about TikTok.\n\nAnd then people start telling me about it\n\nand we started uploading just some clips of my standup on it\n\nand it blew up.\n\nNow I got like 4 million\n\nor maybe 5 million followers on TikTok\n\nand it's just been a great space,\n\ngreat outlet for my standup comedy.\n\nI would argue that maybe more people saw my comedy special\n\non TikTok than on Amazon Prime when it came out.\n\nAnd it's really cool.\n\nIt's reaching a younger generation also.\n\nThere'll be kids coming up to me, little 12-year-old kids\n\nlike, Oh my God, I love you.\n\nYou're the TikTok comedian. I love you on TikTok.\n\nAnd I don't know how I feel about that.\n\nA TikTok comedian somehow sounds kind of weird, but sure.\n\nAnd that's all the boards. It was kind of interesting.\n\nI didn't realize people would Google\n\nJimmy O. Yang I love You\n\nand maybe I will start typing in my own Google search.\n\nJimmy O. Yang I love you.\n\nAnd that's how I practice self-love.\n\nSo till next time, thank you very much Wired.\n\n[upbeat electronic music]",

[Zoe and Selena laughing]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay.\n\nWhere is Selena Gomez from?\n\nOh, Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nAw.\n\nHow far is that from Fort Worth?\n\nAbout 30 minutes.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nSo that was a big night out, if we'd go into the city.\n\n[Producer] What's the most Texas thing about you?\n\nThe most Texas thing about me is my love\n\nfor fried food casseroles,\n\nand the way I cannot stop saying y'all,\n\nno matter how long I've been in LA.\n\n[Zoe laughing]\n\nIt's like embedded in me at this point.\n\nYou do?\n\nI've never heard you say y'all.\n\nWell.\n\nYou're keeping it from us.\n\nI always feel like, when it's like, what's up, y'all?\n\nLike, that kind of thing, but when we're working, I mean,\n\nI'm trying to be professional.\n\nOh my god, professional indeed.\n\nOkay, who does Selena Gomez play in Emilia Perez?\n\nI play Jessi.\n\nShe is very fierce, she deals with a lot of different stuff,\n\nbut she's, you know, really fun to play.\n\nIt was one of the coolest experiences,\n\nand I think I learned a lot.\n\nI'm still relatively new, I think, in that space,\n\nso it was nice to be around people who made me feel safe\n\nand comfortable to try things\n\nthat I'd never tried before. Yes, you were very, like,\n\nquiet and sitting really quietly there in the corner.\n\nSelena, we're ready for you,\n\nand as soon as she would get on set\n\nand Jacques would say action,\n\nit was like this other creature would come out\n\nand we're like.\n\n[Selena laughing] It was insane, it was awesome.\n\n[Selena] Aw, thanks.\n\n[Zoe] Are Selena Gomez and Steve Martin friends?\n\nYes, I am friends with Steve and Marty,\n\nand both of them have become, you know,\n\ninspirations, role models in a way.\n\nYes.\n\nThey're really fun, you guys.\n\nThey're so much fun. You guys are kinda\n\nlike The Three Stooges.\n\nIt feels like that. [Zoe laughing]\n\nI feel like I'm constantly living\n\nin a comedy sketch with them.\n\nIt's the best feeling.\n\n[Zoe] Can Selena Gomez speak Spanish?\n\nI wish I was fluent.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not.\n\nNot yet.\n\nNot yet.\n\nYou're right, I'm gonna say not yet.\n\nYeah, it was really fun, though, to be able to step back\n\ninto Spanish for this movie,\n\nand I was fluent when I was younger,\n\nbut I started working at seven,\n\nand that was mainly English-speaking roles,\n\nso kind of bummed,\n\nbut it's also fun. So Barney\n\ndidn't speak Spanish?\n\nNo, it was dubbed. Boo, Barney!\n\nI think it was dubbed, though.\n\n[Selena laughing] It was dubbed.\n\nIt was dubbed.\n\nGreat.\n\nYou hold this. Okay.\n\n[Selena] When did Zoe Saldana get married?\n\n[Zoe laughing] Oh my God.\n\nWhen you get to be my age, you tend to forget,\n\nyou know, years, but I, we got married the summer of 2013.\n\nAw.\n\nWe did it outside of the US,\n\n'cause I was working on location,\n\nand my family happened to just arrive from, you know,\n\nto spend the summer with us, and we thought,\n\nwell, my family's here, we just have to fly your folks,\n\nand it was a very small wedding,\n\nand it was just so beautiful.\n\nYes. That's so sweet.\n\nAnd I had to ask for the day off,\n\n'cause I didn't tell anybody, and then I realized that\n\nI was on the schedule the day that we were gonna do it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I spoke to the AD and I said,\n\nit was the funniest thing, I was like,\n\nI'm so sorry, I know that this is out of the norm,\n\nbut can I ask for this day off?\n\nThe thing is, I'm getting married.\n\nAnd I've never saw.

That'd be hard.\n\nWhat is Offsets [tape rips]\n\nrecording process.\n\nMe and my engineer,\n\na couple of my close friends, always a producer.\n\nI would love for a producer to be in there to cook with me\n\n'cause I feel like when you got a producer in there,\n\ny'all go off each other energy.\n\nI like to record a lot of times earlier on in the day.\n\nI used to record real late at night.\n\nI feel like earlier your mind be a little bit more fresher,\n\nyou might not get so repetitive off of tiredness.\n\n[Producer] Is most of it written or not much?\n\nNah, I don't write nothing.\n\nI just go off of the vibes, so I plug in\n\nafter each bar, whatever come to my mind.\n\nI'll say it a couple times.\n\nThe one that I like that I keep and then go to the next bar.\n\nWhat is Offsets [tape rips]\n\nfavorite collaboration?\n\nRecently is Denim Tears because it dropped almost a year ago\n\nand to this day I see it in movies.\n\nI see it every day when I'm walking around\n\nevery day somewhere, somehow I see\n\nthe pieces that I created and it means something to me\n\n'cause, you know, I know I did it right\n\nand people rock with.\n\nWhat is Offset's [tape rips]\n\nfashion style?\n\nMy fashion style is like, it ain't no specific style.\n\nI feel like I can go any which way.\n\nStay on a vibe for a little bit\n\nand then I like to move on and just keep switching.\n\nI feel like fashion\n\ndon't really have no statement or no sentence to it.\n\nWhatever you feel like look good on you, look good on you.\n\n[Producer] Describe your vibe now.\n\nMy vibe now is like\n\narchive pieces.\n\nI'm putting on nothing but pieces.\n\nToday, I have a Vivian Westwood original.\n\nThis is the piece right here.\n\nYou gotta find this.

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Charlie Puth,\n\nand this is the Wired: Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[gentle upbeat music]\n\nThere's not many people I would see and cry on the spot.\n\nIf Britney walked in, I would, gosh.\n\n[gentle upbeat music]\n\nStyrofoam, reminds me of a Dunkin' cup.\n\nDoes Charlie Puth have perfect pitch?\n\nNo, I bet you don't hear it everywhere I go.\n\nIt's like become my personality.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nIt comes in handy with writing songs, I'd say,\n\nother than it being a neat little parlor trick.\n\nBut I think what it does come in handy\n\nfor is hearing the song before it's made.\n\nEspecially when you're working with an artist\n\nand you've written like a demo or an idea\n\nand they're not rocking with the key,\n\nyou can kind of change the key in your head\n\nand just get right to it.\n\nIt kind of speeds things up a little bit.\n\nBut you don't need it to make music, I'll say that.\n\nDoes Charlie Puth use autotune?\n\nYes, and so does everybody else.\n\nAnd if they say they don't, they're lying.\n\nDoes Charlie Puth have a twin brother?\n\nI do not have a twin brother.\n\nAlthough my brother does look a lot like me,\n\nhe is actually twins with my sister, who is my manager.\n\nThanks.\n\nWho is Charlie Puth to Taylor Swift?\n\nI don't know,\n\nyou have to get her to sit down and do one of these.\n\nBut I really enjoyed that compliment\n\nshe gave me in that song,\n\nthat was very nice.\n\nI heard a leak of it and I thought it was a computer.\n\nI thought it was AI, which I thought was pretty funny.\n\nI thought someone was playing a joke on me.\n\nBut then I heard it again and I thought,\n\nIt's just too clever to be a robot,\n\nand then I just won that day. [chuckles]\n\nWhy is Charlie Puth so popular in Korea?\n\nI don't know, but I feel very lucky\n\nto be so popular in Korea.\n\nI've collaborated with some Korean artists.\n\nI love Korea.\n\nIt has the energy of New York\n\nwhere it's a lot of hustle and bustle\n\nand a lot of things getting done all at once,\n\nbut it's not in New York.\n\nIt's like on the complete other side of the planet.\n\nCharlie Puth keyboard.\n\nI'm assuming they're asking what keyboard I use a lot,\n\nand that would be a keyboard called the Triton by Korg,\n\nand I play a Steinway Baby Grand on tour.\n\nI think a good keyboard can bring out any singer's voice,\n\nespecially a real one,\n\nespecially with some good chords under it too.\n\nCan Charlie Puth dance?\n\nNo, just do a quick YouTube search\n\nof me trying to move around on tour.\n\nAnd they once got me a movement coach,\n\njust horrible, horrible mistake,\n\nbecause I think I'm pretty intellectual\n\nand I tend to think things over many, many times,\n\nwhich works when making a song,\n\n'cause you're not dancing,\n\nor at least I'm not dancing, but to dance,\n\nyou kind of have to be free with your body, I'm told,\n\nand, I mean, look at me.\n\nSo, no, Charlie Puth cannot dance,\n\nbut I think that's a good thing.\n\nWhen is Charlie Puth birthday?\n\nNot grammatically correct, but that's okay.\n\nMy birthday is December 2nd, Sagittarius.\n\nI share my birthday with the Queen, Britney Spears,\n\nthe reason why I make pop music.\n\nThere's not many people I would see and cry on the spot.\n\nIf Britney walked in, I would, gosh.\n\nIs Charlie Puth still making music?\n\nYes.\n\nI mean, well, I've finished filming a TV show.\n\nNow I have a TV show,\n\nbecause in 2020 when they said that live music was dead,\n\nI thought I wasn't gonna be able to make music anymore,\n\nso I made a TV show, I started writing a TV show.\n\nAnd four years later, it's finally here.\n\nIt's called The Charlie Puth Show.\n\nIt's got my friends that I've known for 10 years,\n\nand new friends like Will Ferrell and Courteney Cox.\n\nIt's basically about me being a multi-hyphenate\n\nin the ever-changing music industry.\n\nThe constant pressure of remaining in the zeitgeist,\n\nand I'm just making fun of myself the entire show.\n\nIf you don't like me, you should watch the show,\n\nbecause I'm literally making fun of myself the entire time.\n\nCharlie Puth duets.\n\nI've had some duets.\n\nMy favorite duet is We Don't Talk Anymore\n\nwith Selena Gomez.\n\nI remember where I was when I made the song.\n\nWe started it in Miami\n\nand took it all the way to the Philippines.\n\nSo, sonically, it has a like innate,\n\nlike tropicalness in it,\n\nI think, which was a thing in 2016.\n\nBut I love that song.\n\nI just got back from Brazil last week,\n\nand I don't even have to sing it on stage,\n\nthe audience sings it for me, which is a big pleasure.\n\nAnd the last one, Charlie Puth 'Pitchfork.'\n\nI think they just love me so much there\n\nto speak so highly of me.\n\nI think they have pictures of me\n\non their office walls there.\n\nSuch lovely, nice things to say about me and my music.\n\nOh my god, the compliments I get\n\nabout my music from Pitchfork.\n\nIt's funny because like I just, they're just so right.\n\nI am the best.\n\nWhat was Charlie Puth's, I'm nervous, first song?\n\nMy first song you will never hear.\n\nIt was uploaded to MySpace.\n\nAnd if you know how to use an internet archive machine,\n\nyou can use it, but you won't be hearing it here.\n\n[Producer] What was the first song of yours\n\nthat gained any traction?\n\nThe first song of mine that gained any traction\n\nwas See You Again, the biggest song.\n\nTotally frightening for a brand new artist\n\nto be just projected into the media at the time.\n\nBut I love that song,\n\nand I'll play it for the rest of my life.\n\nWhat songs has Charlie Puth\n\nwritten for others?\n\nNot too many songs for others.\n\nI actually started out as a songwriter for other artists.\n\nMy first cut ever was a Pitbull song.\n\nI think it was called Celebrate.\n\nI don't know if it's the best of my work.\n\nStay by The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber.\n\nI wrote Slow Motion for Trey Songz.\n\nI wrote Harleys in Hawaii by Katy Perry, fan favorite.\n\nBut it's all a blur, I don't really remember.\n\nWhat is 'See You Again' by Charlie Puth about?\n\nSee You Again is actually about my friend Vale,\n\nwho passed in 2012.\n\nWhen we both attended Berklee College of Music,\n\nhe always told me that I would write that song.\n\nHe would describe it, but not musically describe it.\n\nHe would just say that it was going to be a song\n\nthat a lot of people were going to hear,\n\nand it was pretty surreal just two years later\n\nwriting his song that he said that I would always write.\n\nWhat Charlie Puth, it's a long one,\n\nsong are you quiz?\n\nI don't know if that's grammatically correct.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nWhat Charlie Puth song are you quiz?\n\n[Producer] Have you ever seen, like, a BuzzFeed?\n\nWhich Charlie Puth song are you most personally like?\n\nWhat of your songs do you feel like\n\nyou most personally resonate with?\n\nI think all of my songs are obviously super personal.\n\nThere has to be some sort of innate personality\n\ngoing into these songs with melody\n\nfor them to sound like me.\n\nBut I don't know if I'm as mean\n\nas the song Attention or How Long\n\neven though I wrote them.\n\nBut I guess all of the songs\n\njust kind of thrown in a little bowl\n\nand mixed up with some Betty Crocker mix.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhat are Charlie Puth fans called?\n\nNow I'm gonna get endless shit for this,\n\nbut I don't think there's a name for them.\n\nI'd like everybody to express themselves\n\nand their individuality separately,\n\nbut maybe Charlie Puth fans.\n\nWhat songs does Charlie Puth sing on tour?\n\nWell, we're actually going on tour later this year,\n\nnot in the US, but in Asia.\n\nAnd I get to sing some songs\n\noff my second record, Voicenotes,\n\nwhich I haven't sung in quite some time,\n\nalong with the new stuff.\n\nBut I'm working on the next album now,\n\nso next year you'll hear me sing all the songs\n\nthat I'm singing now, alone every day.\n\nWhat's with Charlie Puth's eyebrow?\n\nIt's a scar, it's not shaved or anything.\n\nI can't believe I'm still answering\n\nthat after all these years, but it's a scar.\n\nWhat is Charlie Puth's phone number?\n\nObviously, not doing that,\n\nbut I've changed it a couple of times,\n\nso I've gotten that question recently, not on a whiteboard.\n\nCan Charlie Puth beatbox?\n\nYes, you know what's funny?\n\nI was thinking about this the other day.\n\nI didn't write this song,\n\nI claim no responsibility for its production or anything.\n\nBut a good friend of mine, Johan,\n\nproduced Dangerous Woman by Ariana Grande.\n\nAnd a couple years after it came out,\n\nhe pointed out that he had taken,\n\nlike when I smack my lips together,\n\nit makes a little pretend clap sound,\n\n[smacks lips] kick drum. [smacks lips]\n\nAnd he took that [smacks lips], and you can hear it,\n\nit's very distinct, but you can hear it,\n\nand very low in the mix,\n\nyou can hear it in the very beginning of Dangerous Woman.\n\nSo it's a pleasure spitting all over that song.\n\nIs Charlie Puth in a relationship?\n\nYeah, I just got married.\n\nI have a beautiful wife named Brooke,\n\nwho I've known my entire life.\n\nAnd what's really cool is that our parents\n\nhave also known each other for all of their lives,\n\nso it's two families coming together.\n\nFinal question, Charlie Puth playlist.\n\nI have a secret playlist,\n\nwhich I have no problem telling you about,\n\nit's called 12:00 AM in the Back by the Kitchen.\n\nIt's on Spotify,\n\nand it's a collection of all my favorite\n\nNew York-based hip-hop artists.\n\nAnd the reason why it's called\n\n12:00 AM in the Back by the Kitchen\n\nis because I was on a date three years ago,\n\nand they were playing not great music,\n\nbut the restaurant was so cool\n\nand where we were sitting was so cool.\n\nAnd I thought it would be so great\n\nif they had this song, this song, this song.\n\nI'll let you check it out.\n\nJust Google that or search it,\n\nI don't know how you do that.\n\nI thought those were good questions.\n\nI'm humbled that people still wanna know things about me,\n\nbut I don't mind answering those questions.\n\nIt's part of the gig, I guess.",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, this is Jennie\n\nand this is the WIRED Autocomplete Interview.\n\n[upbeat bright music]\n\nThis is the most I had to talk about myself.\n\n[all laugh]\n\nWow.\n\n[upbeat bright music]\n\nWhen did Jennie join Blackpink?\n\nI was always there.\n\nWe put out our first single in 2016 August,\n\nso that's when Blackpink happened.\n\nWhen did Jennie move to New Zealand?\n\nI was nine and I was there till 14. So five good years.\n\nSee, I used to have a stronger accent,\n\nbut it's completely gone.\n\nPeople don't ever guess\n\nthat I'm from New Zealand anymore, which is sad.\n\nI think this is a New Zealand thing about me.\n\nI like Marmite jam.\n\nAnd so me and Rose are the only excited people\n\nwhen we were in a city\n\nand they sorta provide us with Vegemite or Marmite.\n\nWhen did Jennie release solo?\n\nFive years ago I wanna say.\n\nSix years ago, five years ago.\n\nI think five. My bet's on five.\n\nIt feels like it was such a long time ago\n\n'cause while preparing for Mantra,\n\nI looked back at the videos\n\nand photos of me from back in the solo days\n\nand I was like, Wow, I look so young and cute.\n\nIt's definitely different working as a solo artist.\n\nI'm in the studio alone. [giggles]\n\nFirst of all, when I was working on the group stuff,\n\nI talked a lot with the girls on, if we all agree\n\nand relate to the song a lot,\n\nbut now I have to make all of those decisions on my own.\n\nSo I think that's the biggest difference that I have.\n\nNext please.\n\n[board clatters]\n\nWhen did Jennie start singing professionally? 14.\n\nBut I was singing my whole life.\n\nI'm assuming, I was singing as a kid too.\n\nJennie outfits stage.\n\nWe like to change\n\naround like our tour outfits a lot when we're on tour,\n\nespecially 'cause we like to just match the vibe\n\nof the city that we're in.\n\nBut I feel like my style is pretty open-minded.\n\nWhy is Jennie Instagram jennierubyjane?\n\nIt's a name that I came up\n\nwith when I was in school in New Zealand.\n\nI wanted a nice, long, pretty name like my friends.\n\nAnd then it just stuck with me.\n\nSo it's like a name for me that I made for myself.\n\nHow to dress like Jennie? [giggles]\n\nI feel like everyone's killing it though.\n\nLike everyone already knows the answer to this.\n\nNext please. [board clatters]\n\n[all laugh]\n\nI always wanted to do this.\n\n[crew laugh]\n\nWhat is Jennie like?\n\nI am a very shy person.\n\nEven when I'm around my friends,\n\nI am likely to be the quiet one,\n\nbut I am very different from what you see on stage.\n\nSo hopefully we get to know each other better.\n\nWhat is Jennie favorite fruit?\n\nIt changes all the time actually.\n\nIt used to be strawberries.\n\nNowadays I'm really into kiwis.\n\nWhat is Jennie favorite song in Blackpink?\n\nThis is always a tough one.\n\nI wanna say Lovesick Girls right now.\n\nLike it changes all the time,\n\nbut right now it's Lovesick Girls\n\nIt has such a cute girly moments of Blackpink\n\nand it's a rare type of vibe that we have for us on stage\n\nbecause we do a lot of stronger charismatic things.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nOh, what is Jennie nickname?\n\nI have a lot of nicknames.\n\nI have Jendeugi. That's a Korean nickname.\n\nI have Nini. My friends call me Nini.\n\nIt evolved from my original name, which is Jennie.\n\nWhat is Jennie doing now?\n\nWell, I am currently at the WIRED Interview,\n\nbut my single Mantra came out a few days ago, I think.\n\nSo I'm very busy being happy.\n\nI think making of this whole album was definitely a big step\n\nfor me to grow as a solo artist.\n\nThis specific song, Mantra is I think a great opener.\n\nIt's like a little bit of a tease moment of Jennie,\n\nI would say into the album.\n\n[tongue clicks]\n\n[board clatters]\n\nJust Jennie. Who Jennie Blackpink best friend?\n\nI have lots of best friends.\n\nYou guys are my best friends. [giggles]\n\nHow many piercings does Jennie have?\n\nSo I used to have a lot of piercings as a teenager,\n\nbut I got rid of it throughout the years\n\nand I think I am left with four piercings on this ear\n\nand two on this ear.\n\nSo just on my ears.\n\nDoes Jennie write songs?\n\nIndeed, I do. [giggles]\n\nYeah, hopefully you guys get to hear more\n\nof my songs when the album drops, so be excited.\n\nYes, of course. [Jennie laughs]\n\nJennie dog.\n\nAw, my dog is named Kuma. He's back home.\n\nHe's with my mom right now. I miss him.\n\nHe's the best behaved dog ever. He loves me though.\n\nI think I'm still up\n\nto this day his favorite human on earth,\n\neven though I don't get to see him as much as I did.\n\nBut yeah, he's very happy to see me every time I see him.\n\nWata.\n\n[board clatters]\n\nFinal board? Yay.\n\nJennie rap. Yes, I do rap.\n\nThank you. [giggles]\n\nI love to rap and you'll hear more in my album too.\n\n[giggles] Jennie One Of The Girls.\n\nIt is my most dream song on Spotify.\n\nI'm so happy that it's doing great. Jennie capybara.\n\nI watched a capybara video I before I got here today.\n\nI know capybara isn't like the most well-known animals\n\non Earth\n\nand I started to talk about them a lot\n\n'cause I get questions about what is my favorite animal\n\nand I've always been attached to capybara.\n\nYeah, they probably just wanted to know what a capybara is,\n\nbut I think they are more trending nowadays.\n\nMakes me very proud.\n\nSo I shot a music video with one years ago for Ice Cream.\n\nThat was one of the best day ever that I had.\n\nI need to go see one soon.\n\n[paper scrapes]\n\nOh, Jennie Jacquemus runway.\n\nSo I walked for the Jacquemus show in May in Capri,\n\nand it was my first time running on a runway.\n\nIt was a very special occasion for me.\n\nI only have good memories from this day\n\n'cause I thought I'd be very nervous and anxious about it,\n\nbut from the moment I arrived in Capri, I was just like,\n\nLet me just have fun.\n\nThat was also another proud moment of this year for me. Woo.\n\nThankfully I wasn't surprised by any of the questions.\n\nI think I had most of them in mind. So step it up, guys.\n\nAsk more interesting questions to Google about me. [giggles]\n\nThank you for having me and I'll see you next time.\n\n[lips smack]\n\nBye.\n\n[light warbling music]",

See at the end?\n\nWhat are you looking at?\n\nSo I have a different version to Ari, the director.\n\nThe idea is that she's now gone through a psychotic break.\n\nFrom the moment she chooses, I believe accidentally,\n\nChristian, her boyfriend, to get burnt,\n\nshe keeps on waking up and going back in\n\nto this like, psychotic break,\n\nand when that moment at the end happens\n\nwhere everything is going up in flames,\n\nI tried to embody what I was like when I was five\n\non Bonfire Night. Mm. Mm.\n\nAnd just how- Nice.\n\nExciting it was to see flames,\n\nand I wanted to revert back to a very, very small\n\nand simple life of how simple things made\n\nand make children feel. Mm.\n\nBecause in that moment,\n\nI presumed that she wasn't there anymore.\n\nWhat does Florence Pugh take in The Wonder?\n\nOh, a form of heroin, like, or opiates.\n\nYeah. And it's supposed to.\n\nYeah, you have like a similar high,\n\nand she just feels great and groovy.\n\nThese are cool questions.\n\nThese are interesting things- They are.\n\nTo get to the bottom of.\n\nWhat knife- Ooh.\n\nDoes Florence Pugh use? Oh.\n\nYou gave me a lovely knife.\n\nI did give you a nice knife.\n\nKnife. Knife.\n\nI use mainly Japanese knives,\n\nbecause I just think that they are the prettiest to hold,\n\nthey are the daintiest to use, and they're bloody sharp,\n\nso you have to be really careful.\n\nI've got loads of scars on my fingers.\n\nYou've been cutting yourself up, huh?\n\nI've been cutting myself.\n\nBurnt myself recently.\n\nI was wondering about that. Yeah.\n\nBurnt myself on a pan, 'cause I was making pasta.\n\nBlink twice if you need rescuing from-\n\nNo, that was to myself, so I'll blink four times.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay, and then you have a psychotic break?\n\n[Florence laughs]\n\nWhere is Florence Pugh's accent from?\n\nI mean, I grew up in the country-\n\nOxford? Yeah, I grew up in Oxford\n\nin the countryside.\n\nThe country bumpkin does, every now and then, come out\n\nwhen I talk to my old friends.\n\nIt's a nice voice. It's a nice accent.\n\nThanks. I think we can all agree.\n\n[laughs] I don't think any of us would disagree with that.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nThey call this the stupid era, like the witching hour,\n\nwhere someone starts to go a little bit mad.\n\nThat's me right now.\n\nDo you know what you're doing?\n\nYep. Cool.\n\nWhat is Andrew Garfield's best movie?\n\n[Andrew laughs]\n\nI can't answer that.\n\nWell, you have to.

Ah.\n\nAh.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI don't know if ever. It's possible never.\n\nIt's possible maybe at some point.\n\nI know. You'll get over it. No, that was acid burn.\n\nOh, right.

Maybe on a sultry,\n\nspring evening.\n\nGorgina.\n\nHow to get Andrew Garfield hair.\n\nWhat products do you use?\n\nI use, well, no, it's more about the thickness.\n\nOh, don't I know about this man's hair thickness.\n\n[board thuds] Thank you for joining\n\nthe Andrew Garfield and Florence Show,\n\nand we'll see you next week.\n\nOkay, bye.\n\n[both laugh]",

That might be next.\n\nI think it was freshman year in high school.\n\n[Link] Yes.\n\nWhen we somehow talked those sophomore girls,\n\nTabitha and Jamie, into being our girlfriends.\n\nAnd everybody was like, Well, hold on now.\n\nAnd Rhett's parents had to drive us to the movie theater.\n\nAll four of us in the back seat.\n\nHow do you fit four high schoolers\n\nin the back of a Dodge Dynasty?\n\nI don't know. We did it.\n\nHey, there's nothing wrong with a little smoosh action\n\non a first date.\n\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\nAnd then when we were on the way back from the movie,\n\nit got a little bit quiet.\n\nNo one knew what to say.\n\nAnd Link said, It sure will be nice\n\nwhen they make this road four lanes.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThey did make it four lanes and it was nice.\n\nIt was nice.\n\nBut it's not like you made it happen.\n\nPull the next one. Okay.\n\n[Link] And read it to me 'cause I can't read it.\n\nWhen did Rhett and Link deconstruct?\n\nWhen did Rhett and Link spiritually implode?\n\nYou wanna be serious about this for a moment?\n\nSure will be nice when they make this road four lanes.\n\n[Rhett laughs]\n\nOur spiritual deconstruction was a long grueling process.\n\nPainful in many ways. The most difficult thing\n\nI've ever done in my life.\n\nMe too.\n\nWe were steeped in Southern Bible Belt Evangelicalism,\n\nlike the tea bags that we were.\n\nPlease continue with this analogy.\n\nWell, we brewed for a long time\n\nand then we started,\n\nthen we started to weaken and seep out.\n\nIt was a long, painful, scary process.\n\nAnd I'm glad I was there for Rhett through the whole thing.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause I don't think he would've made it\n\nwithout me. Thank you, Link.\n\nI'm very grateful for where I came from\n\nand who it made me to be,\n\nbut also the parts that I shed over the years.\n\nSo I'm in a good spot now.\n\nMe too.\n\nWhen is Rhett and Link's birthday?\n\nWell, we don't have the same birthday.\n\nWe don't have the same one.\n\nI mean, we did have the same first girlfriend.\n\nWe also lost our virginity in the same hotel.\n\nNot at the same hotel room though.\n\nRight. I don't think.\n\nAnd not at the same time.\n\nNot at the same time.\n\nOne year apart. One year apart.\n\nLink had to get Tim, one of our friends,\n\nto go to the CVS\n\nto get three types of lube.\n\nWhy do you need three?\n\nWhy?\n\nI was like, Bring options!\n\n[Rhett] Okay.\n\nAnd a lot of it.\n\nI sort of made things happen that, you know,\n\nwe didn't need a drug store to be involved.\n\nGod.\n\n[Rhett] When will Rhett and Link retire?\n\nHow can you retire if you don't have a job?\n\nThat's good, Link.\n\nI mean, we're sitting here living the dream.\n\nAt a young age,\n\nwe were literally dreaming about this in abstract,\n\nnot really knowing what YouTube could be\n\nor that anyone else would think we were capable\n\nof being entertaining or engaging.\n\nWell, I think that every YouTuber\n\nis on a collision course\n\nwith either retirement or irrelevance.\n\nAnd we've been running-\n\nFrom both. Forever. Right.\n\nSo we'll see which one gets to us first.\n\nYes!\n\nWould you like to peel?\n\n[Link] How are Rhett and Link as bosses?\n\nWell, I would say, A, figuring it out as we go along.\n\nBut there did come a point where we were like,\n\nI think we're running a company.\n\nMaybe we should read a book about that.\n\nRight.\n\n[Rhett laughs]\n\nWe were not just leading our audience of fans,\n\nbut we were leading a group of employees\n\nand building a culture.\n\nI mean, once you start to realize\n\nthat the actions you take have ripple effects\n\nthrough people's livelihoods,\n\nit becomes very intimidating\n\nand it makes you read a few books.\n\nIt makes you hire some coaches.\n\nWhy did Rhett and Link\n\nsell Smosh?\n\nYou know, their future was extremely uncertain.\n\nWe ended up buying Smosh\n\nand creating an environment\n\nwhere they could stay on their feet and and grow.\n\nAnthony came back into the picture.\n\nMet with with Ian.\n\nThey came to us and said,\n\nHey guys, what if we bought this thing back?\n\nAnd we were like, We think that would be amazing.\n\nWe continue to want to be a positive force\n\nin the creator community and share what we've learned\n\nand expand what Mythical means,\n\nbut also benefit other creators\n\nand kind of show the way as we're fumbling forwards.\n\nLots of times, honestly.\n\nAre Rhett and Link no longer best friends?\n\nOr just friends, don't even say best.\n\nYou added a little best in there.\n\nI think that people have this tendency,\n\nthey want to believe that it is an impossibility\n\nfor two people who have been friends\n\nsince they were first graders\n\nwho have worked together all this time\n\nto still actually be friends\n\nwhen their friendship has become monetized.\n\nI think I understand why people would think,\n\nwell really, isn't it just a business now?\n\nWhat we ended up realizing\n\nis that we actually have to focus on the friendship\n\napart from the business\n\nin order to make sure that the friendship\n\ndoesn't just exist for the business.\n\nI actually think it's a really healthy thing\n\nthat we have to keep coming back together\n\nand we have to keep having a good time together\n\nbecause then we end up having a good time together.\n\nWe can't help ourselves, can we?\n\nYeah. Right. You gotta saddle that horse.\n\nThat's right.\n\n[Link chuckles]\n\n[Link] Rhett and Link inspirational quotes.\n\nOkay. What?\n\nA man once said-\n\nI just need some inspirational quotes.\n\n[Both] At the intersection of doubt and hope-\n\nIs where growth happens.\n\nWhen life gives you lemons,\n\nmake orange juice and let the world wonder how you did it.\n\nWow. I'm actually kind of inspired by that.\n\n[Link laughs]\n\nYeah. I can't help myself.\n\nOh.\n\nOh, I get to rip 'em again.\n\nWho owns Rhett and Link?\n\n[Rhett laughs]\n\nIn the context of Good Mythical Morning,\n\nusing the parlance of our times,\n\nI would say that Stevie owns us quite frequently, you know?\n\nPuts us in our place.\n\nYeah.\n\nShe called us boys for a long time\n\nand then Rhet had a problem with that.\n\nSo then she started calling us everything else\n\nunder the sun.\n\nI think she called us queef biscuits once.\n\nYeah, she did.\n\nShe did that. I actually kinda liked that one.\n\nNobody owns us.\n\nMythical Entertainment is an independent organization\n\nowned by...\n\nMe. Us.\n\nAnd him.\n\nWho's Rhett?\n\nAnd who's Link?\n\nOur first thing that we ever did\n\nwas perform live comedy music.\n\nI played the guitar.\n\nI'm right-handed.\n\nThe neck of the guitar goes this way.\n\nIt would be right here.\n\nSo I didn't like that.\n\nAnd then we went and performed at this place.\n\nBut we were always known as Rhett and Link.\n\nYeah. Even then.\n\nBut they had a Rhett and Link logo on a screen\n\nbehind us one time when we were performing\n\nand we we're like,\n\nOh no, I realize that they're gonna think\n\nthat you're Rhett and I'm Link.\n\nAnd that's the last thing I want\n\nis for people to think I'm Rhett.\n\nRight. And so we switched places\n\nand we have stayed that way ever since.\n\nWhen you get stopped in public,\n\nwhat do people call you?\n\nThey call me Rhett.\n\nThey call me Rhett, too.\n\nYeah.\n\n[Link] Why don't Rhett and Link-\n\n[Rhett] Oh that's a long one.\n\n[Link] Feed themselves.\n\n[Rhett] Oh yeah.\n\nWhy are these grown ass men\n\ngetting employees to reach on the camera and feed them?\n\nYeah, that's a great question.\n\nSpeed.\n\nWe thought it was funnier that way.\n\nEven when we're on another channel.\n\nRight.\n\nThere's a hand ready to feed us.\n\nKG has very, very clean hands.\n\nI don't. Link doesn't as well.\n\nAnd when you've got dirty hands\n\nand you eat food, what happens is,\n\nis you taste your hands.\n\nYou just wanna taste the food.\n\nYou don't want to taste hand.\n\nRhett and Link handshake.\n\nOur senior year we went to prom.\n\nAnd we didn't dress up much in those days.\n\nSo when we put on tuxes,\n\nespecially tuxes with tails,\n\nwhen you're dressed in that fashion,\n\nyou feel like you need to shake hands with someone\n\nwho's also dressed in that fashion.\n\nI bet you we didn't even talk about it.\n\nI bet you it's just something that just happened.\n\nYou know, it's like, hey, my girlfriend's dad\n\ntaking our picture and we got tuxes on.\n\nSo I don't know. You just lift a leg.\n\nEvery time we take a photo.\n\nEvery time we dress up.\n\nOn like a red carpet, you know?\n\n'Cause I mean we practically live on a red carpet.\n\n[both chuckle]\n\nWe always do that pose.\n\nIt's the pose.\n\nRhett and Link blood oath.\n\nThis was when we were, between 14 and 16,\n\nwe went out to the cow pasture that we frequented.\n\nWe basically had this discussion back and forth\n\nand we decided we were gonna do something big together.\n\nBut we wrote it down sheet of paper\n\nand then we got a sharp rock.\n\nThat was all that was available.\n\nAnd we cut our fingers and we signed a oath in blood.\n\nAnd because people are now Googling this,\n\nI feel like we should create an image for people\n\nso when they search Rhett and Link blood oath\n\nthey can actually see it.\n\n[Crew Member] We have a box cutter.\n\n[Rhett] Okay.\n\nWe'll do it. We're gonna do it later.\n\n[Rhett] Okay, Link.\n\nYou got your own board.\n\nThis is what people are wondering about Link.\n\n[Link] People wanna know about me, not about you.\n\nNeal III.\n\nThree Is.\n\nLink Neal I I I.

That's me.\n\nI've always gone by Link\n\nexcept my nana would call me Little Link\n\n'cause her husband was Lincoln.\n\nPull me off.\n\nI mean, just, let's keep going.\n\n[Rhett] Why can't Link Neal use knives?\n\n[Link chuckles]\n\nYeah. What's up with that?\n\nBecause sometimes I get my hand on a knife\n\nand things go sideways.\n\nSometimes we do let him use a knife.\n\nWe gave him a knife on his birthday.\n\nIt was like giving a little baby a cake.\n\nIt was beautiful.\n\nIs Link Neal a DJ?\n\nOh, enough about me!\n\nA little more about me!\n\nI am not a DJ, but my alter ego,\n\nElk Hound Snuggle Baby is a DJ.\n\nHe's not charging money for the parties that he DJs\n\n'cause he just doesn't think he can.\n\nWhat does Link Neal's tattoo say?\n\nThis tattoo says ahoy bagoric.\n\nIt's Elvish.\n\nIt says You're special.\n\nIt's a matching tattoo that I have with my daughter.\n\nShe was like, Dad, I want to give you the gift\n\nof us getting matching tattoos for my birthday.\n\nI believe it was.\n\nAnd that's how I got talked into getting a tattoo.\n\nAnd then I couldn't stop.\n\nI can talk about me forever, but.\n\nOh no, the Rhett board.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAs introductions to English football go, this was about as unceremonious as it gets. Two of Manchester City's four midseason signings made their debuts in Saturday's 2-1 FA Cup fourth-round win (stream a replay on ESPN+,U.S. only) at League One minnows Leyton Orient. Nico Gonzalez lasted 22 minutes before injury struck and Vitor Reis was taken off at half-time.\n\nIt was in part a testament to Orient's tenacity and defiance which at one stage put them on course for one of the all-time great Cup shocks, having already produced one of the all-time great Cup goals.\n\nJamie Donley's stunning 45-yard effort will go into the record books as a Stefan Ortega own goal, given City's goalkeeper had the final touch as the Orient forward's long-range strike hit the crossbar. But it's Donley name that will go down as providing the moment that will last a lifetime in the minds of all 8,749 fans who crammed into the Gaughan Group Stadium on a wet and cold day in east London.\n\nCity were adamant that Gonzalez, a \u00a350 million deadline-day signing from FC Porto, was fouled by Charlie Kelman moments before to turn over possession to Donley, but manager Pep Guardiola had a simple message for his new acquisition afterwards: \"Welcome to the Premier League and the referees.\"\n\nSaid Guardiola: \"Maybe he knew about the referees, because I understand it's not easy. It's not easy to do something when you play against teams like in League One. You have to live that. My first away game was against Stoke, a long time ago. I realised immediately what was the Premier League.\"\n\nIt is a lesson Gonzalez, Reis and the rest must learn quickly. Real Madrid will hardly be trembling with fear when they watch this ahead of Tuesday's Champions League knockout playoff round first leg at Etihad Stadium.\n\nCity may have got the job done -- through an equaliser from Abdukodir Khusanov which he knew nothing about, with a Rico Lewis shot deflecting in off his back, and a well-worked winner from another substitute, Kevin De Bruyne -- but there was little to recommend them beyond their perseverance as Orient made them look ordinary for long periods.\n\nCity entered the market knowing they need an immediate bounce from their new arrivals. It is a difficult ask for any player in the middle of a season but with an outlay of \u00a3180m comes instant expectation.\n\nInstead, Guardiola was left to curate the game-time of his new players in a different way. Put simply, Reis was withdrawn at the break because City were down 1-0.\n\n\"The plan was Ruben [Dias to play] for 45 minutes after his injury and I didn't want to bring two new players playing at the same time with that result,\" Guardiola explained. \"It was too much risk. I want one alongside with experience, either Ruben or John [Stones].\"\n\nKevin De Bruyne celebrates with teammates after scoring the goal which squeezed Man City past Leyton Orient. JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nKhusanov has steadied himself a little after a calamitous debut against Chelsea last month but the 20-year-old is still undeniably raw. After he conceded a free kick with a rash challenge when the score was 1-1, Guardiola kicked the side of the dugout in frustration.\n\nOmar Marmoush, City's fourth January signing, was one of City's brighter players, constantly probing for an opening while Savinho and Jack Grealish carried a threat out wide.\n\nBut Orient, inspired by their two loanees from Spurs in Donley and goalkeeper Josh Keeley, fought, hassled and harried their way to rival City until De Bruyne's intervention 11 minutes from time.\n\nThere was still one last scare -- Dan Happe met a 90th-minute free kick at the back post but could only steer his left-footed shot off target -- but City held on.\n\nIn customary FA Cup style, Guardiola had been the pantomime villain all afternoon. The team bus arrived to chants of \"City get battered everywhere they go\" while Guardiola was targeted by gleeful Orient fans as their team threatened an almighty upset.\n\n\"When they say 'you are going to get sacked in the morning' ...,\" he said. \"But it is a routine in all the stadiums right now, Still, with this result I think my chairman is not going to sack me tomorrow.\n\n\"It was really good. I don't know if in League One, in every single game the vibe is like this, but it's really good. You come to enjoy the football, the locker room is so tight. The players can talk even more than in a normal locker room. But I said many times to the players: 'we came from here.'\n\n\"We didn't warm up at 16, 17, 18 years old and go to Wembley. We were born in these locker rooms. Especially when you play in the lower divisions, I like the way the team behaves, because how many surprises have there been in the FA Cup, in the long history of this competition?\"\n\nCity did not add to that list on Saturday, but they also did not silence concerns they are over their slump either.\n\n\"Now of course our position is a little bit unstable emotionally; we have conceded a lot of injuries and that's why going through with this result makes me so proud and so happy,\" Guardiola said.\n\nImprovement is needed. Reis was not registered for the Champions League knockouts, but Marmoush, Khusanov and Gonzalez were. Orient provided a reminder here how necessary it will be to hit the ground running against Real Madrid and not leave a mountain to climb at the Bernabeu on Feb. 19.",

In Rodri's absence, City has seen its Premier League title defense unravel and needs to beat holder Madrid in a two-legged playoff to advance to the round of 16 in the Champions League.\n\nGonzalez was one of five signings in the January window as Guardiola attempted to salvage the season.\n\nCity spent more than $200 million in a spree that also saw the arrivals of Egypt forward Omar Marmoush for $73 million and defenders Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens and Vitor Reis for a combined $77 million. Christian McFarlane, an 18-year-old left back, joined from sister club New York City FC while captain Kyle Walker left for AC Milan.\n\nCity fought back from going a goal down in the first half to win 2-1 and advance to the fifth round.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPep Guardiola has denied that Manchester City's January recruitment drive was motivated by concern within the club that they could be hit with a transfer embargo.\n\nCity spent \u00a3175 million ($217m) on Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Nico Gonzalez in the January window -- more than any other Premier League side. It was a departure from their usual cautious approach in the winter window which has seen them decide against making a significant mid-season signing since Aymeric Laporte's arrival from Athletic Bilbao in January 2018.\n\nGuardiola has insisted the January spend was due to the injury problems which have impacted his team in the first half of season. But it has not stopped speculation that City opted to bring in a number of new players because of fears that a transfer embargo could be one of the punishments handed down if the club are found guilty of breaching the Premier League's financial rules.\n\n\"I do not agree but my words will not convince people that our attributes are just being in a wealthy position,\" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.\n\n\"In the last five years, we are the last team in the top six for net spend.\n\n\"Even after what we have spent in this transfer window, we are away from Chelsea, [Manchester] United, Arsenal, Totttenham. Even from Liverpool. The only reason why is because we sell a lot in the last seasons but even with that I know this club, it is always 'just about the money'.\"\n\nPep Guardiola has struggled to maintain his side's typically imperious form this season. Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nThe hearing into City's 115 charges for allegedly breaching Premier League financial rules began in September and concluded in December.\n\nIf they're found guilty, punishments could range from a fine to a points deduction. Guardiola said he believes a verdict will be delivered in \"one month.\"\n\n\"In one month I think there will be a verdict and a sentence and after that we will see my opinion of what happened so far,\" he said.\n\n\"Still, at the end, every club can do whatever they want. Because in the last 10 years we are third [for net-spend], but in the last five, even with what we won, we are behind the top six teams so I'm sorry for the comments and that is why I don't agree.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Guardiola said he is not planning on having Rodri available again until next season. The midfielder has been out since September with a knee injury, but has been included in City's squad for the Champions League knock-out rounds.\n\n\"I would love to arrive in the latter stages of the Champions League and Rodri could help us but in my mind Rodri is for next season,\" said Guardiola.\n\n\"Maybe he comes back earlier, that would be good for us.\"",

                "text": "The ESPN FC Live crew discuss whether Harry Maguire's goal for Manchester United should have stood and why there was no VAR in this round of the FA Cup. (1:21)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nManchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side's last-gasp winner against Leicester City in the FA Cup fourth-round showed the team believed until the final whistle, but it had \"nothing to do with Fergie time.\"\n\nIn one sense, Friday night's result brought a familiar feeling from the days of Sir Alex Ferguson, when late winners became as synonymous as the titles his sides won.\n\nHowever, it was the sluggish first-half performance that drew Amorim's ire after the match.\n\n\"We had to believe until the end but this game has nothing to do with the time of Fergie. I think the performance, we have to do so much better with the ball, without the ball,\" Amorim told ITV after the match.\n\n\"We didn't have any energy in the beginning, especially in the first-half. Then in the second half we played a little bit better, with a little more speed, winning second balls. Then we managed to turn things around so it was a good result not a good performance.\n\nRuben Amorim's Man United side has struggled for form at Old Trafford this season. Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images\n\n\"The coach is the first responsible, when one team doesn't perform, doesn't improve, it is the coach but we are here to do things and to see the game, to study the game and try to improve for the next game.\"\n\nUnited failed to manage a shot on target in the first half at Old Trafford -- the third time this season they have done so, according to ESPN Global Research.\n\nUnited went behind before half-time when Wilfred Ndidi's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana, only for Bobby De Cordova-Reid to head in the rebound from close range.\n\nA strike from Joshua Zirkzee levelled the scores in the second half, and the game appeared to be heading into extra time before Maguire headed in the winner in the 93rd minute from Bruno Fernandes' free kick, seconds before the final whistle.\n\n\"I think it's the small things, if you see the games sometimes it's to control the ball, to have the ball, don't give the ball away in the first pressure. It's the small things, it's the big things, it's everything,\" Amorim added.\n\n\"It's this moment, it's hard away but especially at home but we have to cope with that and we will try to do it next game.\"\n\nLeicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy let his own displeasures known after the game, pointing to Maguire being in an offside position when the free-kick was delivered.\n\n\"This (loss) wasn't necessary,\" an unhappy Van Nistelrooy told ITV. \"This was half a meter [offside]. Then extra time, stay in the game, you never know what happens.\n\n\"We deserved to go into extra time and maybe penalties. Decisions like these in our level are hard to swallow.\"\n\nVAR will be used in the FA Cup for this first time this season in the fifth round.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 season of the Indian Super League is in full swing, and with games coming thick and fast, this is a convenient place to catch up on every match. We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nThe report on all matches from matchweek 19 is here.\n\nHere are the details for matchweek 20 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n\nEast Bengal 0-3 Chennaiyin FC\n\n(Nishu Kumar (OG) 13', Wilmar Jordan Gil 22', Daniel Chima Chukwu 90+9')\n\nEast Bengal's hopes of making the ISL playoffs are virtually over after they fell to a 3-0 defeat to Chennaiyin FC at home on Saturday evening. East Bengal got off to the worst possible start, conceding twice in 22 minutes.\n\nThat 2-0 lead so early in the game was completed deserved as well, which was perhaps the biggest disappointment for Oscar Bruzon, his team just didn't show up. On the pitch, they couldn't deal with Connor Shields' energy and the intelligence of his movement. He set up the first, a Nishu Kumar own goal, and then played a part in Irfan Yadwad setting up Wilmar Jordan Gil to tap in their second.\n\nEast Bengal had Lalchungunga sent off late on, before Daniel Chima Chukwu added gloss to the scoreline for Chennaiyin in the ninth minute of second half stoppage time.\n\nHyderabad FC 3-1 Mohammedan SC\n\n(Allan Paulista 24', Ramlunchhunga 45+1', Joseph Sunny 90+6'; Makan Chothe 78')\n\nHyderabad FC made it two wins in their last three ISL games with a comfortable 3-1 dispatching of Mohammedan SC at home in a clash of the bottom two sides of the ISL on Saturday evening.\n\nAllan Paulista opened the scoring for the hosts, before an excellent free-kick from Ramlunchhunga doubled their advantange justbefore half-time. Even though Makan Chothe pulled one back for Mohammedan late on, Joseph Sunny wrapped up the points for the hosts in second-half stoppage time.\n\nWith that win, Hyderabad moved five points clear of Mohammedan, who are now likely to finish bottom in their debut ISL season.\n\nNorthEast United 0-2 Mumbai City FC\n\nMumbai City FC's late-season momentum picked up another surge with a 2-0 win over NorthEast United in the first-ever ISL game held in Shillong, Friday night. Bipin Singh gave Mumbai the lead in the 41st minute, before skipper Lallianzuala Chhangte made sure of the points in second-half stoppage time.\n\nThe result moved Mumbai up to fourth position, and well within the playoff spots, for the moment. NorthEast moved a spot down to 5th, with 29 points in 20 games, two behind Mumbai while also having played a game more than the reigning ISL cup winners.\n\nWith just four games left to go for Juan Pedro Benali's side, they will be looking nervously over their shoulders, as both Bengaluru FC and Odisha FC could potentially make up ground on them in the next week or two.\n\nFC Goa 2-1 Odisha FC\n\nBrison Fernandes 29', Lalthathanga Khawlhring 47' (OG), Rahul KP 54'\n\nFC Goa were back to winning ways with a well-earned 2-1 victory over 10-men Odisha FC at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Thursday.\n\nBrison Fernandes starred with a goal in the first half before an own-goal by Lalthathanga Khawlhring early in the second gave Goa a comfortable lead. Rahul KP pulled one back for Odisha, but it was not enough to deny Manolo Marquez's side, who climbed back to second place in the ISL standings with 36 points from 19 matches.\n\nMohun Bagan 3-0 Punjab FC\n\n(Jamie MacLaren 57' 90', Greg Stewart 63')\n\nMohun Bagan extended their lead atop the Indian Super League (ISL) table to a mammoth twelve points with a 3-0 win over Punjab FC. Jamie MacLaren's second-half brace and Greg Stewart's goal was enough to ensure playoff qualification for Bagan, who are twelve clear of second-placed Jamshedpur albeit having played two games more, while Punjab remained ninth, five points behind Mumbai City FC in the last playoff position.\n\nIn keeping with their reputation, Punjab FC started the game in cautious fashion, happy to sit back and let Ravi Kumar make his saves, although Bagan were restricted in the chances they had, thus ensuring the first half finished goalless.\n\nIt took a little over ten minutes for the league leaders to break the deadlock in the second half, as Jamie MacLaren did well to control Manvir Singh's cross from the right in the box, turn and rifle a low drive into the bottom corner, thus giving Bagan a 1-0 lead in the 57th minute. Ravi Kumar was doing his best to keep Punjab in the game, denying MacLaren with a reflex save soon after, but he had no chance in the 63rd minute when the home side doubled their lead. Liston Colaco found himself in the left wing, and curled a delicious cross that looked to have crept into the opposite bottom corner, although Greg Stewart claimed to have made the faintest of touches with the ball en route it's path to goal.\n\nPunjab tried their best to come back into the game, but could not breach the Bagan defence, and the game ended as a contest in the 90th minute, when Ashish Pradhan's pass back to the keeper was intercepted by Jason Cummings and he squared for MacLaren to finish things off.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAnother fortnight without a break, another Musings that gets to cover two weeks' worth of ISL action. And some action it's been.\n\nWe muse, then, on matchweeks 18 and 19.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nOwen Coyle is feeling the pressure, and then some\n\nAfter Chennaiyin got smacked around by the Kerala Blasters at home, Owen Coyle trained his guns on ISL commentator Robin Singh in the post-match briefing. The reason for his ire? An admittedly poor decision to send Wilmar Jordan Gil off for a flailing hand in the 37th minute. You can understand why Coyle was angry, but he's seen worse and reacted better. His loss of control in going after Robin hinted at a deeper issue.\n\n11th in the league, ten points off the playoffs pace, without a win in their last seven (and just one, against Hyderabad, in their last 12), Chennaiyin's season has completely derailed. Quiet fan protest has now found voice, both online and off, and it appears evident that Coyle is feeling the heat. Can he buckle down and turn it around for a late unlikely charge for the top 6?\n\nThe Blasters soap opera rolls on\n\nA stumble in Kolkata against a fired up East Bengal. Beating neighbours Chennaiyin comprehensively a few days later. A normal couple of matches in what's been a proper rollercoaster of a season for the Blasters. But, but... a win and a loss? That's it? Well, no.\n\nKwame Peprah scored the third goal for Kerala Blasters against Chennaiyin FC. Shibu Preman/Focus Sports/FSDL\n\nIn the dying minutes of that game against Chennaiyin, arguably their performance of the season, Adrian Luna and Noah Sadaoui came this close to Lee Bowyer-Kieron Dyer part II. Luna was furious Sadaoui had shot instead of passing when 3-on-1, Sadaoui was furious because he saw that as a legitimate shooting opportunity, and Ishan Pandita (the free-est of the three on that counter, and most aggrieved party in all this) had to play the role of peacemaker. Now, of course, both Luna and Sadaoui are great professionals, and probably hashed it out in the dressing room immediately or at training the next day, but that little moment was another reminder that there is no such thing as a regular matchweek for the Kerala Blasters.\n\nHyderabad really are great spoilsports\n\nFirst, they pulled off draws (that probably deserved more) against title challengers FC Goa and Bengaluru. Then they pulled off a remarkable comeback to beat a very strong Jamshedpur outfit. Positive results against three of the best teams this season... and all done through solid performances. Shameel Chembakath has done a stellar job since taking over and his team has inadvertently done quite the job in ensuring Mohin Bagan get a free-ish run to the league shield.\n\nWhat's more, they're great fun to watch. The goals that brought them back against Jamshedpur -- Joseph Sunny's sublime touch and finish plus Andrei Alba's long-range howitzer -- exemplifies this.\n\nSure, like they did in the hammering by NorthEast United, they still sometimes slip into the poor habits that saw them start the season so slowly but the difference from week 1 to week 9 is stark: credit to Chembakath and the team for that.\n\nAlaeddine, the genie, can only do so much\n\nThere are dream debut seasons, and there's whatever Alaeddine Ajaraie is having in ISL 2024-25. 18 goals the man has now, the joint-most any player has ever scored in a single season and with five more games to go just in this league phase, that 'joint' won't be there for much longer.\n\nA force of goal-plundering nature, Alaeddine has been the genie NorthEast United have craved for so long, and his goals are powering them along in their quest for a place in the playoffs. But will it be enough?\n\nTake their game against Odisha on Monday, for instance. Alaeddine scored the two goals that put his team 2-1 up, but from the moment he got taken off it seemed inevitable Odisha would equalise -- and they did. Alaeddine's face at that moment made for quite the picture: it can't be all on him.\n\nWith just one win in their last six matches, their winning momentum from earlier in the season has stalled... while they maybe fourth in the table as things stand, they need to rediscover it pronto to keep away the charge that will surely come from those below them.\n\nJamshedpur are the business\n\nJavier Siverio scoring braces. Lazar Cirkovic scoring stunners. Mohammed Sanan sitting down fullback after fullback. Javi Hernandez doing whatever he likes. Beating Manolo Marquez's high-flying Goa 3 - 1 with 38% possession. Hello, Khalid Jamil, Indian football is a better place with you in it.\n\nAdimazes / ISL\n\nJamil's men have been in a proper run of form in this back half (especially at home), and while their poor early away form may have cost them a proper tilt at Mohun Bagan and their league shield, the playoffs will present a massive opportunity. Unlike the shield, the destination of the ISL cup is by no means a foregone conclusion, and Jamil's Jamshedpur are the main reason for that.\n\nSpeaking of, can we just crown Mohun Bagan champions now?\n\nIt's not just the fact that no one has conceded fewer goals than Mohun Bagan this season, it's that the next lowest have conceded eight more...and only one team has scored more. This season has been one long, nearly unbroken, exhibition of this Bagan squad's vast talents.\n\nThat league shield oughtn't be moving from the Bagan tent in the maidan now. Last season, they won it with 48 points in 22 games. This season they already have 43 in 19... and there's no one within striking distance -- not unless an out-of-the-blue implosion happens.\n\nThe Bengaluru implosion continues\n\nOh, what an implosion it's been. From leading the league to being tight challengers at the top to now barely clinging onto a top 6 post, it's been quite a back half to the season for Bengaluru FC. They have drawn one and lost five of their last six matches and the manner of the latest defeat underlines just how fast their freefall has become.\n\nThey took the lead only to be pegged back inside six minutes against Punjab. They then conceded again, before a stunning late equaliser in the 92nd minute. A draw in a match like this, seized in such a dramatic manner, might just have been the turning point Gerard Zaragoza and his men needed - but Luka Majcen sliced through their defence to score in the 96th minute and that was that.\n\nWith Jamshedpur coming to the Kanteerava next, Bengaluru will need to pull off something special to ensure they get some momentum going and keep what's become an elusive playoff place for them.\n\nMumbai City and Odisha are hanging on\n\nLooking on most gleefully at said BFC implosion are Odisha and Mumbai City. Both have shown glimpses of how good they can be (sample Isak's equaliser vs NEUFC) without doing anything that would mark them out as special. A loss here, a draw there, a win now and then, and they have just kept on keeping on all season long.\n\nMumbai don't concede much (second-best), but they don't score much (fourth worst); Odisha score a lot (joint second-best), but they concede a lot too (fourth worst); but in all this they have kept within range of the playoffs. Mumbai are sixth, and Odisha seventh, but if BFC keep slipping they are well poised to move a place up each.\n\nCan Punjab mount a late rush?\n\nThe team mostly like to make a charge from outside the current playoff spots, though, looks to be Punjab FC. Another team that started strong before petering into mediocrity, Luka Majcen's late winner against BFC was exactly the push they needed to remind themselves that they are so much better than they have shown recently. With a match in hand over Odisha and Mumbai and two over the Blasters, BFC and NEUFC, they really could make the race for the playoffs a thrilling finish.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nJust a couple of years ago, the goalkeeping position was spoken of as the strongest for the Indian men's football team. There was good reason to believe so - Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Amrinder Singh were well-established in the Indian Super League; Phurba Lachenpa emerged with a splash for Mumbai City FC; Vishal Kaith kept winning Mohun Bagan penalty shootout after penalty shootout. The national team had an embarrassment of riches in terms of options between the sticks.\n\nHow quickly do things change, then? On the evidence of this season, it won't just be bad selection if Manolo Marquez chooses to stick with seniority for the India's upcoming games in March. It would be self-sabotage if Kaith isn't given the no.1 position. Outside of Kaith, the goalkeeping in the ISL this season has been a jamboree of one comical error after another. When Marquez picks his squad for next month's AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, for once, the focus won't be entirely fixed on that eternal question about Sunil Chhetri's successor. Is the time now ripe for Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's successor?\n\nKaith is the ISL's best goalkeeper by a distance\n\nHe's played every minute of Mohun Bagan's ISL season so far. He's only conceded 14 goals in those 19 games. Perhaps, what should tilt the scales in Kaith's favour is how assured he has looked in all of those outings. He has had the least work to do of any goalkeeper in the league, on average facing 3.84 shots on target per game, and has conceded an average of only 0.7 goals per game.\n\nThat is, by far, the best of any goalkeeper in the league. Of course, that Mohun Bagan have had the best defence in the league has played its part. It would be disingenuous, though, to ignore that Kaith has been almost flawless in a season when the number of goalkeeping errors has surged through the roof.\n\nESPN\n\nAccording to Opta, Kaith's 3.2 goals prevented this season is by far the best of any goalkeeper in the league. In fact, only him and Hrithik Tiwari have prevented more goals than they were expected to. In contrast, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Amrinder Singh, India's first two choice goalkeepers until the last international break, sit at -7.9 and -4.2 respectively on the same metric. In simple terms, Kaith saves what he's supposed to and more, while India's other options... do not. Worse, they let in goals from shots they ought to save.\n\nGurpreet's dramatic downfall\n\nIt's not preposterous to say that Gurpreet has cost Bengaluru FC a more sustained title race (even if the club does have other issues). They may or may not have caught this machine of a Mohun Bagan side. They certainly have had their wings clipped by the incumbent India no.1's worst season of his club career.\n\nNo other goalkeeper has made more errors directly leading to goals than Gurpreet (Amrinder has made as many as him). No one has made more errors directly leading to shots than Gurpreet. Perhaps more damning than all of that is that there have been errors of all kinds. Anything that could go wrong for a goalkeeper has gone wrong for Gurpreet this season.\n\nAgainst FC Goa in November, he was dispossessed by a pressing striker in his own box. Against NorthEast United in that same month, he came charging out of his area, but hit his clearance against an onrushing attacker. Against Chennaiyin FC in December, he failed to catch a straightforward header. Against Jamshedpur FC in January, he came way off his line and then didn't catch the ball or punch it convincingly.\n\nESPN\n\nSo, he's not saving shots, not catching crosses, not playing the ball out of the back well enough, and not judging danger well enough. It's not sacrilege to suggest he's lucky to still be starting games for Bengaluru. One must wonder what else Lalthuammawia Ralte needs to go his way to get a start for them.\n\nThese mistakes aren't isolated to just his club. Gurpreet made a bad mistake in judging the bounce of a long ball in India's last friendly against Malaysia, too. This after being at fault for the first goal that India conceded in the AFC Asian Cup last year, when he didn't catch a cross. These mistakes and below-par performances have become a familiar sight, and his position as India no.1 has never been under more scrutiny.\n\nYounger prospects not pushing their case either\n\nThe veterans in Gurpreet and Amrinder have been poor, so what about the youngsters then? Maybe not as poor, but hardly encouraging. Phurba Lachenpa has found himself stuck in a bit of a rut. Even though he's not made the number of glaring errors that Gurpreet or Amrinder might have, he's also not saving shots at the rate that he should be, having conceded 2 goals more than Opta's data expected him to.\n\nBhaskar Roy at Mohammedan SC was responsible for one of the most comical own goals the sport has ever seen, when he punched the ball into his own net. Kerala Blasters' Sachin Suresh, so impressive in his debut season last term, now makes the same mistake time and time again - spilling low shots right into the danger area in front of him.\n\nHrithik, given a go by Marquez at FC Goa this season to replace Laxmikant Kattimani early on, has been quietly impressive. But in a crunch game against Jamshedpur FC, he too made a poor error, letting a meek shot through him, with his body not behind the ball at all - what some would consider a fundamental error for a goalkeeper.\n\nThe likes of Lachenpa, Sachin and Prabhsukhan Gill have all shown in the ISL that they are promising goalkeepers. However, the bug has caught them all. Nobody is stopping shots at the rate they are expected to. Indian goalkeeping finds itself at a low that few saw coming, but a bulk of these goalkeepers are still very young, and it is a role where a lot of players do become better with age.\n\nThere are some potentially excellent goalkeepers in India, none more so than Vishal Kaith. The time has never been more ripe for him to be given the national team's reins.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMADRID -- Real Madrid's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid in Saturday's derby means there's no change at the top of the table, with just one point still separating the two teams. Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez's first-half penalty had Atletico hoping they might secure their first win at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u since 2016, but Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's equalizer early in the second half meant the visitors had to settle for a point.\n\nReal had the better of the second half as both goalkeepers, Thibaut Courtois and Jan Oblak, making important late saves. Here are three talking points, after a result that leaves LaLiga's title race wide open.\n\n1. Penalty call means more ammunition for ref debate\n\nAfter all the noise this week -- the refereeing complaints, the open letters, the social media posts -- it was time for the football. Or was it?\n\nThe build-up to this derby was dominated by Real's demands for \"structural reform\" of refereeing, and Atletico's critique of their rivals for putting officials under pressure. So of course, when the game began, it was no different.\n\nNaturally, the spotlight was on referee Cesar Soto Grado and his VAR colleague Ricardo De Burgos Bengoetxea. There were deafening whistles for both officials' names when they were read out over the stadium tannoy, pre-match. The only question was: when would the first big decision come? And would they get it right?\n\nFor the first half hour of the game, very little happened: it was exactly the game Atletico and Simeone wanted, with not much football and precious few chances. Then, that moment of pol\u00e9mica (Spanish for \"controversy\") arrived.\n\nAur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, once again playing out of position at centre-back, reached for the ball inside the box and seems to catch Samuel Lino's foot with his studs. A long, drawn-out VAR check followed. Tchouameni had trodden on Lino's foot, but by the time the contact came, the ball had gone.\n\nThe penalty that gave Atletico a derby lead will give Real Madrid fans and media plenty to talk about following an entertaining draw. Angel Martinez/Getty Images\n\nReferee Soto Grado came across to check the pitchside monitor, and as the stadium held its breath -- or rather, whistled vociferously -- he awarded a penalty that Julian Alvarez coolly converted, chipping the ball down the middle of the goal. It was the first penalty awarded against Real Madrid all season in LaLiga, but that won't stop the incident being endlessly debated and cited.\n\nAt halftime, there were more whistles as Soto Grado walked off the pitch, but that was as much a reflection of fan frustration at Real's performance as anything. In the first half, they had created very little, with an xG (expected goals) of just 0.23.\n\n2. Mbapp\u00e9 leads the fightback to underline his improving form\n\nAfter the break, Real Madrid looked a different side. It took just five minutes in the second half for Mbapp\u00e9 to equalize, pouncing on the ball inside the box, after Jude Bellingham's shot had been blocked by defender Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez. Mbapp\u00e9's instinctive, confident finish, struck hard into the ground to bounce up and past goalkeeper Jan Oblak, was one of a player whose form continues to curve upwards.\n\nThe France star now has 23 goals in all competitions this season, with nine of those coming already in 2025. Further proof of his form could be seen in the pre-game as he briefly celebrated with LaLiga's Player of the Month award.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is becoming one of this team's leaders, and his reaction to the goal -- racing back to the centre circle, hungry for more -- showed that.\n\nThe goal was also a precursor to Madrid's best spell in the match. Moments later, Bellingham headed against the crossbar, reaching the ball just a fraction of a second ahead of Mbapp\u00e9. Madrid were well on top, but Oblak kept Atletico in the game, weathering the storm. Later, Mbapp\u00e9 could have provided the perfect finale, but he was denied by Oblak in the 89th minute; at the other end, Courtois saved too in added time.\n\nMbappe continued his shimmering form with a well-taken goal to ensure Real took a point from Saturday's derby. Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThere have been doubts about whether Mbapp\u00e9 really is \"back\" considering that his goals since Christmas have mostly come against so-called lesser teams like Las Palmas, Salzburg and Real Valladolid. That wasn't the case here, and with Manchester City coming up in the Champions League, there will be two opportunities this month to put that theory to the test.\n\n3. A draw means either team -- or Bar\u00e7a -- could still win LaLiga\n\nA win for Real Madrid on Saturday night would have sent them four points clear at the top of the table. It wouldn't have been an insurmountable lead with 15 games still to play, but it would have been a significant one. But they couldn't complete the job in the second half, and the draw means Atletico -- who led the table before dropping points against Legan\u00e9s and Villarreal in January -- remain very much in the picture.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nAtletico's first-half performance at the Bernab\u00e9u was vintage Simeone, the team looking near-impossible to break down. They moved in unison to deny any space, sometimes with a backline of six players, with wingers Giuliano Simeone and Lino dropping back to help the defence. In that first half it meant Real Madrid, despite their much vaunted \"fantastic four\" attack of Mbapp\u00e9, Bellingham, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, looked toothless.\n\nThe second half was less convincing and in the end, Atletico had Oblak to thank for earning them a point.\n\nHansi Flick's Barcelona will have been looking on with interest, having seemingly bounced back from their December slump. A win for Bar\u00e7a at a struggling Sevilla on Sunday would put them a point behind Atletico and two behind Real, with Bar\u00e7a due to visit Atletico next month. The prospect of a proper, three-horse title race that goes the distance is now a very real one.",

                "text": "The ESPN FC Live crew discuss whether Harry Maguire's goal for Manchester United should have stood and why there was no VAR in this round of the FA Cup. (1:21)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nMANCHESTER, England -- Ruben Amorim will hope that one day, the FA Cup will slip down his list of priorities.\n\nRight now, though, with Manchester United languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League table, it's offering some welcome respite for the under-pressure manager.\n\nNothing is coming easy for Amorim at the moment and United, who handed a debut to January signing Patrick Dorgu, had to fight back from a goal down to beat Leicester City 2-1 at Old Trafford on Friday. It required a stoppage time header from Harry Maguire -- which appeared to be offside -- to book United's place in the FA Cup's fifth round.\n\nBut the most important thing for Amorim is that they've advanced, and hardware is still on the line.\n\nIt has been tempting for some supporters to believe that the club has written off the rest of this season, particularly after a quiet January transfer window with little effort made to add a new attacker. At least the FA Cup offers something to keep fans interested.\n\nUntil Amorim can turn this team around to the point where title challenges become the norm -- and that seems a long way off right now -- he needs to cling to every small success he can.\n\n\"It was a good result, not a good performance,\" Amorim said. \"I think the performance, we have to do so much better with the ball, without the ball. Today is a feeling of the win, and the fans go home with that feeling of win.\n\n\"It's hard to point to something to give them [the fans] confidence, just the spirit in the second half, more energy, more second balls. The rest, there is a lot to improve. We already knew that we need to do better.\"\n\nAmorim has repeatedly warned supporters that things could get very messy between now and the summer, when he'll have a chance to bring in his own players and time to work on the training ground. Home defeats to Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton and Crystal Palace have proved him correct.\n\nUnited aren't good enough at the moment for the week-in, week-out battle of the Premier League. The good news for Amorim is that you don't need to be consistent in the FA Cup.\n\nYou just need to be good a little bit, and in fits and starts. Throw in a little bit of luck and you can get quite close to Wembley. Maybe even win the whole thing. And United were fortunate to get through the FA Cup last round when Arsenal failed to take advantage of Diogo Dalot's red card and lost on penalties at the Emirates.\n\nEven with all their problems, Amorim's team were expected to beat Leicester, a side rooted in the bottom three in the Premier League -- but United still struggled.\n\nThe first half was so poor that they couldn't muster a single shot on target as Ruud van Nistelrooy's team went in at half-time deservedly 1-0 up. United's first-half expected goals tally of just 0.05 was tied for the lowest in Amorim's 20 games in charge.\n\nThe game only changed in the second half with the introduction of substitutes Alejandro Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee. Even then it was a slog. Zirkzee scored to make it 1-1. But just as extra time beckoned, United were awarded a contentious free kick by referee Michael Salisbury after the ball flicked up off Garnacho and hit James Justin's elbow.\n\nIt was United's first bit of luck. Salisbury put the whistle to his lips, pulled it away again and then finally blew. Van Nistelrooy raged on the touchline and before the Dutchman had calmed down, Bruno Fernandes floated his cross into the box and Maguire headed in the winner.\n\nReplays showed Maguire was at least a yard offside, but with no VAR until the next round, the goal stood. United's second -- and decisive -- piece of luck.\n\n\"VAR you have in a couple centimetres, a couple of inches; this was half a metre, clear in line,\" Van Nistelrooy fumed afterwards. \"That was a hard one to take because the team deserves to draw in the end.\n\n\"Then extra time, stay in the game, you never know what happens. We deserved to go into extra time, go for the battle in extra time and maybe penalties. Decisions like these in our level are hard to swallow.\"\n\nEven Amorim admitted the call was wrong, but such are the rules of the FA Cup.\n\n\"With VAR it was not a goal, and I think it's important to have because it's fair,\" Amorim said. \"It's really hard to lose one game in the last minute with an offside play, but sometimes we deserve a little bit of luck.\"\n\nAt the moment, United need it.\n\nThe victory over Leicester was United's third in four games, but afterwards Amorim looked like a man whose worries have deepened rather than eased. It was the type of performance that will do that to a head coach. He has seen lots of them since taking over for Erik ten Hag in November.\n\nThe danger is that United could serve up the same in their next two games -- tricky away fixtures against Everton and Tottenham. They are two of only seven teams below them in the table, and if results don't go United's way, they could conceivably be 16th in two weeks. That would make things far messier than even Amorim anticipated.\n\nAt least he has another FA Cup tie to look forward to. It was a close call, but the competition continues to offer a glimmer of hope in an otherwise wretched campaign.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe winter transfer window closed on Monday and Manchester United largely underwhelmed in the market thanks to financial constraints and the difficulty in recruiting midseason. Out went Marcus Rashford and Antony, two expensive and unwanted veteran players; in came a largely unknown defender from Serie A (Patrick Dorgu) and a youth player (Ayden Heaven) from Arsenal's academy.\n\nThe biggest issue? They didn't bring in a centerforward to ease the pressure up front and keep them from falling even further behind.\n\nSo what does the remainder of the 2024-25 campaign look like from here under Ruben Amorim? Does he have the players he needs to make his tactics and system work? And how should he tackle the league vs. cups debate, with United still alive in the FA Cup and Europa League while being stuck in the bottom half of the Premier League table?\n\nGab Marcotti and Mark Ogden debate the state of Man United.\n\nOverall, given the situation, how content should Man United fans be with the January transfer window?\n\nOGDEN: I think they should be alarmed, but they won't be surprised. The club has been consistently delivering the message that finances are tight, there is virtually no wriggle room with Profit & Sustainability Rules (PSR) and ultimately, players need to leave in order for the club to raise funds and reduce the wage bill.\n\nTheir January business was sensible from a financial perspective -- United announced annual losses of \u00a3113m ($140m) last September -- but Ruben Amorim's squad is desperately short of attacking quality and the failure to invest in a forward, even on a six-month loan, could cost them their one realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League through winning the Europa League.\n\nI haven't heard a single dissenting voice over the decision to offload Marcus Rashford and Antony on loan to Aston Villa and Real Betis respectively, but to allow them to leave without at least one replacement is really risky because it places even greater pressure on Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee to score the goals they've failed to deliver all season.\n\nThe addition of Patrick Dorgu gives Amorim another option at wing-back, but time will tell if he is the solution. Right now, United are like a sinking ship trying to limp back to port for essential repairs.\n\nMARCOTTI: I'm not quite as negative as Mark here. The financial restrictions are what they are, of course, and I assume most United fans accept that. What you don't want in these situations is to make rash decisions, especially on young players, and I think that's part of the reason why they opted against bringing in another striker now.\n\nHojlund and Zirkzee may not be scoring much, but they are youngsters who represent a huge investment for the club. Bringing in another forward \"to score goals\" on loan risks limiting their playing time and their development. If Amorim ultimately decides to move them on, it becomes harder to do so without losing money.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nI think it's pretty obvious that this is what Amorim is trying to do. Even Tyrell Malacia, who moved to PSV on loan at the end of the window, made no fewer than nine appearances for Amorim. He didn't just write him off, and that has to be the mindset.\n\nShifting Rashford to Aston Villa on that sort of deal was a solid move: There's no point having a guy that won't contribute, and getting Villa to pay a significant chunk of his wages represents a significant savings. However, the fee agreed to make the deal permanent is pretty irrelevant. It's not as if Monchi says \"Hey Omar, I know we agreed \u00a340m, but how about we give you \u00a330m instead?\" The club will then say no and take him back. Those bridges are evidently burned.\n\n(I guess the only scenario might be one where Rashford scores so many goals that Villa make the deal permanent for \u00a340m and then transfer him to Real Madrid or Barcelona or whatever, but let's be real here.)\n\nDorgu is a piece of clay: it's up to Amorim to mold him. He has tremendous physical skills and is a smart kid, but obviously Old Trafford isn't Lecce. It's not lost on anyone that he fits the profile of what Amorm had with Geovany Quenda at Sporting CP.\n\nRuben Amorim has made strides when it comes to shaping this team in his image. How far do they have to go? Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images\n\nHow close are Man United to having the players to implement Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and execute it properly?\n\nMARCOTTI: I think they're very close, and I think we're nearing the point where we can judge Amorim's tactics without the alibi of him needing to fit square pegs in round holes.\n\nDorgu's profile is very similar to Quenda's. The back three -- at least until Lisandro Mart\u00ednez's injury -- has players with the right characteristics in the right positions. Could they use a guy who can carry the ball out of the back, like Gon\u00e7alo Inacio did at Sporting? Sure, but we're getting there.\n\nThe midfield remains a question, since it's not clear Kobbie Mainoo is the right partner for Manuel Ugarte in this system, but the wide areas are OK and there are options at the No.10 position. Centerforward remains an issue, sure.\n\nNote here that I'm talking about profile and characteristics, not quality. Of course, you could get a better version of Ugarte, Mathijs De Ligt, Andr\u00e9 Onana and so on, and United would be better. But the question is whether these are players who fit his system and I think that, with some exceptions, they do.\n\nWhat's been disappointing so far, I think, has been United's performances against poor teams when they need to take the game to the opposition. Clearly the attacking mechanisms aren't working the way they should, but he's closer now to getting the players to improve that.\n\nplay 1:17 Ogden: H\u00f8jlund has been let down by Man United's recruitment Mark Ogden blames Manchester United for not signing a senior striker to help Rasmus H\u00f8jlund.\n\nOGDEN: I disagree with you on this, Gab. I take your point that in perhaps 8-9 positions, United have a competent option for Amorim's line-up, but we are talking the most basic of options. You could make a case for an upgrade in each of those positions, but if we are talking crisis-mode selections then yes: Amorim can just about get by, apart from his attacking options.\n\nWe've seen Amorim's blueprint work away from home against Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, where United have been well-organised and able to score on the counter-attack, but the system fails when faced with a more defensive opponent, especially at Old Trafford.\n\nSo it's a bit of a contradiction. Amorim has been able to implement his plan away from home against better teams, but without the ability to dictate play and play on the front foot, United are dismal and that's why they have been so bad in home games under him.\n\nIs centerforward still the most pressing need, and how confident are you that it can be addressed in the summer?\n\nOGDEN: It's their top problem, but it has been the same for almost a decade. United have made so many mistakes in terms of recruiting a reliable centre-forward and Hojlund and Zirkzee (who isn't a centre-forward, but has had to play the role) are so poor that they would struggle to get in any other Premier League starting line-up.\n\nUnited haven't signed a striker in his prime since Romelu Lukaku in 2017. He was ditched within two years, despite scoring 42 goals in 96 games. United can only dream of that kind of return from any of their forwards now. Instead, they've papered over the cracks with aging stars (Edinson Cavani, Cristiano Ronaldo) and invested in expensive potential (Hojlund, Zirkzee), but they desperately need an experienced striker. Their remit wouldn't just be scoring the goals, but also helping the younger players develop by taking off some of the pressure.\n\nCan it be addressed in the summer? It needs to be, but I don't know where Unired will be able to find the money to sign a Viktor Gy\u00f6keres or Victor Osimhen. With four players out of contract (including Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindel\u00f6f) and the club needing to offload Casemiro, Rashford and Antony on a permanent basis, United will have other areas in need of attention and they only have so much money to spread around -- even less if they miss out on European football.\n\nMARCOTTI: I don't think it's just about having a centerforward, but about having a central striker who fits Amorim's system and does what is required to make it work at its best. Hojlund has 0.16 goals, 0.2 xG and 1.05 shots per 90 minutes this season, with zero assists. Zirkzee has 0.31 goals, 0.40 xG and 1.96 shots per 90 (and one assist).\n\nIt's the shot count I find staggering. It doesn't take an analytics genius to figure out you won't score a lot of goals with a centerforward who doesn't shoot much. Look at the shots per 90 minutes by centerforwards playing for United's peers (by budget) clubs: Erling Haaland (3.89) at Man City, Nico Jackson (3.24) at Chelsea, Dominic Solanke (2.59) at Tottenham and Kai Havertz (2.54) at Arsenal. (In case you're wondering, Liverpool has five forwards who average between Darin Nunez's 2.74 to Mo Salah's 3.98.) That tells you United aren't good at getting the ball to Hojlund/Zirkzee in situations where they're comfortable shooting.\n\nWhether the blame lies with the players, the system or both -- and to what degree -- is something the club need to work out. (By the way, Hojlund averaged 2.65 shots per 90 at Atalanta while Zirkzee had 2.79 for Bologna, so it's not a case of either being shy.)\n\nHojlund just turned 22, and I agree with Mark that Zirkzee is not a natural centerforward for this system. I guess the fact they didn't bring in a forward on loan to take some pressure off Hojlund this winter suggests they want to give him minutes to develop. But come this summer, they need to make a decision. If you're ready to give up on Hojlund, go and splash the cash on a top-shelf central striker.\n\nAs for Zirkzee, his future at United -- if he has one -- is as a No.10 or as a solution off the bench.\n\nplay 2:09 How Marcus Rashford can prove that he wasn't the problem at Manchester United Mark Ogden breaks down Marcus Rashford's loan move to Aston Villa from his boyhood club Manchester United.\n\nShould Man United focus on the Europa League and FA Cup rather than trying to claw back in the Premier League table?\n\nMan United are 12 points and, perhaps more importantly, eight places away from the Champions League spots in the 2024-25 Premier League table. They are 11 points away from qualifying for the Europa League. Given how important European football is in terms of revenue (both prize money and commercial) and in terms of attracting talent, are they better off focusing on trying to win the Europa League or FA Cup? (The former would get them a Champions League berth; the latter would put them into the Europa League.) And in doing so, should they use the rest of the Premier League season for development and experimentation?\n\nMARCOTTI: I think so. The Premier League campaign can't be salvaged at this point, so use it to try things out, work on what you want to do and figure out what you have.\n\nWho can offer a viable left-sided centerback solution in Martinez' absence? How can Matthijs De Ligt develop as a passing central defender in this system? Is there an in-house solution to play alongside Ugarte? Can Dorgu give you what you need down the flank? These are questions you could try to answer.\n\nMake it clear what you're doing, take the pressure of results off, try to play your game, and put all your eggs in the Europa League and FA Cup baskets. You won't get relegated, you'll get valuable experience and learn more about yourself and you may win some important (and lucrative) silverware. That's far more important than finishing ninth instead of 13th or whatever.\n\nOGDEN: Absolutely. It might be hard for many United fans to swallow, but the Premier League is now irrelevant apart from the prize money at stake with every position in the table.\n\nUnited would earn \u00a33.1m ($3.8m) every time they climb a position, but even if they can overturn the seven-point gap between themselves in 13th and ninth-place Fulham, it would only generate an extra \u00a312.4m ($15.4m), which is around two-thirds of Marcus Rashford's annual salary.\n\nObviously, every pound counts right now for United, but winning the Europa League would probably be worth \u00a3100m ($124m) in terms of prize money, gate receipts and commercial earnings next season. Winning the FA Cup and qualifying for the Europa League would be worth around half that, so the mathematics are crystal clear: the Premier League is a distant third in terms of its importance this season.\n\nIt's a high-risk strategy to prioritise cup competitions, but Jose Mourinho did that in 2016-17 and United won the Europa League to qualify for the Champions League. Ruben Amorim must now emulate Mourinho.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWho did well and who struggled in the winter window? ESPN Illustration\n\nWelcome back to Onside/Offside! As we say goodbye to January, Luis Miguel Echegaray shares his thoughts on last month's transfer window in the Premier League and assesses the clubs who failed and delivered. From Arsenal's hesitance to Manchester City's gung-ho approach, here are the winners and losers from the winter's wheeling and dealing.\n\nONSIDE\n\nA good month for Man City\n\nLet me begin by stating that Man City, the four-straight defending champions of the Premier League, don't need any extra plaudits here because their need to aggressively act in January was due to their own self-sabotage. Yes: I know, I know. Rodri's season-ending injury was not the club's fault, but they did shoot themselves in the foot in other ways that directly impacted their horrific run in November and December, disastrous losses -- including the latest one (5-1) against Arsenal -- and their struggles in the Champions League.\n\nFactors like the inability to replace Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez or allowing themselves to become the fifth oldest squad in the league? That's all on them. So before the club do any back-patting in the wake of the January window, let's remember that they had to act because they had no other choice. It's the equivalent of high-fiving the kid in chemistry class who put out a fire he started while playing around with the bunsen burner.\n\nHowever, whether down to choice or need, Man City had to not just act in the window: they needed to get it right. They spent more money than any other team in the Premier League (approximately $223 million), but the arrivals had to justify the outlay for this season and the future too -- and I think they delivered.\n\nOmar Marmoush ($79m) is a tremendous player and most importantly, he gives Pep Guardiola's strategy another dimension. It's like having two Marvel superheroes with different superpowers: Erling Haaland's Hulk and now Marmoush's Spiderman. Despite the errors in his pressure-cooker debut against Chelsea, Abdukodir Khusanov ($42m from Lens) is a very good center-back; as for Vitor Reis? ($37m from Palmeiras), he needs to bulk up, but he is a future Brazil captain. Argentina wonderkid and prospect Claudio \"Diablito\" Echeverri ($15.6m from River Plate, deal agreed in January 2024) will also arrive after his time with Argentina at the Under-20 South American championship.\n\nOn deadline day, City finalized a move for Nico Gonzalez ($61m from FC Porto) and this was a big transfer because the versatile midfielder -- who can play as a No. 6 or a No. 8, naturally filling some of what Rodri offered -- is well liked by Guardiola. In fact, City have been chasing the former Barcelona man since he was a teenager and finally, in the final hour, they got their man. They also signed center-back Juma Bah (Real Valladolid) and 18-year-old left-back Christian McFarlane (NYCFC) for undisclosed amounts.\n\nLetting veteran defender Kyle Walker leave for Milan was also a smart move because what Guardiola needs right now is hunger and a desire to be at the club.\n\nAll in all, Man City acknowledged last summer's faults by pushing forward with their rebuild a window earlier. The title is more than likely out of question this season, but the Champions League? The competition remains alive, as does their chance to retain a top four/five place. But for City, January was not just about the present; it was about the future.\n\nplay 1:25 Laurens: Man City should've had Nico Gonz\u00e1lez in on January 1st Julien Laurens looks at new Manchester City midfielder Nico Gonz\u00e1lez and explains why Pep Guardiola needed him a month ago.\n\nLiverpool were smart to do nothing\n\nWhat if I told you that one of my favorite quotes actually comes from Winnie the Pooh: \"Don't underestimate the value of Doing Nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering with any of them.\"\n\nBasically, it means that sometimes, in life -- and in this case, the transfer window -- the most productive thing you can do is to sit still and appreciate the value of what's around you. Listen, observe and simplify your decisions because the best possible outcomes often happen because you embrace your surroundings and allow yourself to disengage, just focusing on the present.\n\nAnd in terms of incomings, that's exactly what Liverpool did in January.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, the current best team in the league and Europe are a steady ship under Arne Slot. Their identity is strong and the harmony of the squad doesn't need to be disrupted. In other words: don't try and fix something that isn't broken.\n\nThe contract negotiations between Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold are the clear priorities, which prove to be continued headline-grabbers and discussion fodder for all of us, but behind closed doors, the club have a plan for any outcome. They don't need to burden themselves with outside noise and just like Slot has said over and over again, the only thing that matters right now is the internal necessities of the squad and the next game. Everything else is noise.\n\nThis also means that the summer -- coupled with the outcomes of the pending contract negotiations -- becomes a window in which Liverpool can be extremely aggressive in the market. So if Man City aced this transfer window with their determined recruitment of much-needed personnel, then I salute Liverpool for also winning by doing the exact opposite: NOTHING.\n\nplay 1:56 Echegaray: Disasi caps off 'ambitious and aggressive' Aston Villa window Luis Miguel Echegaray reacts to a big transfer window for Aston Villa, completed with a loan deal for defender Axel Disasi from Chelsea.\n\nAston Villa get some much-needed upgrades\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Aston Villa were fighting in the Championship and using January's transfer window to scramble anything they had in order to complete a couple of loan deals for players like Lewis Grabban and Axel Tuanzebe. Now, I don't mean any disrespect to the aforementioned players but Villa -- fresh from earning a bye into the Champions League's Round of 16 and competing for a top four spot in the league -- are a different animal in the market nowadays and Unai Emery (manager), Monchi (president of football operations), Dami\u00e1 Vidagany (director of football operations) all know that the Premier League is a do-or-die environment. For every action, there needs to be a reaction.\n\nThis window, therefore, has been the most aggressive January in the history of the club as Villa had to react over and over again. And it all started with the almost-ostentatious $80m exit of Jhon Dur\u00e1n.\n\nIt's really quite simple. Since arriving from Chicago Fire in 2023 for $17m (add-ons eventually increased the fee to $20m), the 21-year-old Colombia striker has always had his eye on another, shinier destination. He always wanted to leave, and everyone close to the club knew it. You only have to go back to last summer, when he made the crossed-Hammers salute that hinted at his desire to join West Ham after they'd made a bid. It was rejected, but the sentiment remained: Dur\u00e1n always felt he deserved more on the pitch and off it.\n\nVilla kept him happy for a brief moment by increasing his salary back in October, but Emery knew that it really didn't matter. In the end, at some point, Dur\u00e1n wanted more and it wasn't going to be with Villa. The club stuck to their transfer valuation because they knew his departure would leave them with just one natural striker: Ollie Watkins. It didn't help when Arsenal added fuel to the fire by lodging a $45m bid to sign the England international, though it was quickly rejected.\n\nDur\u00e1n's move to Al Nassr opened the doors for Villa to strengthen: not only did they received a total package worth more than $90m, but they had other squad needs as defender Diego Carlos headed to Fenerbah\u00e7e ($10m), fan favorite Emiliano Buend\u00eda left for Bayer Leverkusen (loan with $21m option to sign permanently), 19-year-old Serbia international Kosta Nedeljkovic joined RB Leipzig (loan with option to sign permanently), and Jaden Philogene headed to Ipswich Town for nearly $25m. How would Villa replenish?\n\nWith a dire need for center-backs while Pau Torres and Tyrone Mings are out injured, Villa recruited Chelsea's Axel Disasi on loan (for a fee of $6m), while Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda (Levante, $7.2m) arrived as a backup and project behind Matty Cash.\n\nVilla arguably did better with reinforcements in attack. Donyell Malen (Borussia Dortmund, $26m, plus add-ons), Marcus Rashford (loan from Manchester United with $45m option and Villa covering around 75% of his salary), and Marco Asensio (loan from PSG, no option) are impressive arrivals offering quality, Champions League pedigree and versatility. In those three players, Villa now have diverse coverage across the final third.\n\nIn terms of Rashford (and to a certain degree, Asensio), you can read more elsewhere in our coverage, but ultimately: this is a win for everyone. It's an audition for the 27-year-old attacker and a chance to prove he can still produce. For Villa? I think sometimes a player needs a manager that can get the best out of them, and I've talked to many players that have worked -- and continue to work -- under Emery. They all say the same thing: Even after years of playing and experiencing almost everything on the pitch, he teaches you things you never thought you knew.\n\nFinancially is where the win truly lies because in the age of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), Villa also didn't want to enter a summer with limited decisions. All in all, the departure of Dur\u00e1n and others meant raised more than $100m, which will give them flexibility in the summer when it comes to other moves.\n\nThis was a ridiculously busy window for Aston Villa and I think, overall, they reacted with ambition, purpose and acumen.\n\nOFFSIDE\n\nplay 2:11 Why Man United fans aren't ecstatic about transfer window moves Mark Ogden breaks down Manchester United's moves at the winter transfer window and what it means for the club moving forward.\n\nManchester United didn't get it done\n\nA public service announcement: I am not completely placing Manchester United in the Offside section. Perhaps it's a VAR-check type of Offside, because there were some positive things that the Red Devils did in this window.\n\nFor example, Rashford's departure was necessary because one way or another, he was a cloud hovering over manager Ruben Amorim. His hefty salary was also a burden, so for Aston Villa to come in to pay the majority of it is a big win for United. I also think the versatile, left-sided wing-back Patrick Dorgu ($31m from Lecce) is a great signing for the present and future as his skillset fits Amorim's vision.\n\nHowever, I really think there could have been more creativity when it came to what United needed up front, because it's quite clear that Rasmus H\u00f8jlund and Joshua Zirzkee are not good enough -- at least right now -- to be Amorim's leading men.\n\nCould there have been a situation where one of those players went on loan and in return, United brought in someone else? I really liked the idea of Chelsea's unhappy playmaker Christopher Nkunku at Old Trafford, but he was reportedly only interested in making a permanent exit. Could there have been a bigger incentive to make it work with an option to sign permanently? Who knows. All I know is that United can't play another game with defensive midfielder Kobbie Mainoo leading the line as a false No. 9 like they did vs. Brentford.\n\nExperts keep telling me that the plan is to wait for the summer, but why? Premier League aside -- they are 13th with 14 games left; 27 points behind leagues Liverpool -- Man United are still in the FA Cup and earned a bye to the Round of 16 in the UEFA Europa League. There might be a chance for a trophy here. I know it's improbable, but it's not impossible and Amorim has a good record in cup competitions. It will be harder without more firepower, but I guess they disagree.\n\nTo make matters worse, defender Lisandro Mart\u00ednez has been ruled out for the season with an ACL injury. When it rains, it pours.\n\nplay 1:08 Did Arsenal miss a chance by not spending for a striker? Mark Ogden discusses Arsenal not bringing in a striker during this transfer window and why they may regret it.\n\nArsenal also didn't address their biggest need\n\nNow remember: I'm grading their transfer window, not their performances on the pitch, so in that spirit I have to put the Gunners in Offside here for one obvious reason: the inability to bring in a legitimate goal scorer.\n\nI know there are many arguments to counter this point. One, Arsenal have the second-best scoring record in the Premier league, with last weekend's magnificent 5-1 victory against Man City showing how they spread the goals around. (This looks even more impressive when you factor in that Mikel Arteta is having to manage without Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus, both of whom are nursing long-term injuries.)\n\nBut I have said it many, many times. Arsenal are not supposed to be satisfied with a top-four finish. They want the Premier League title, but this won't happen unless they sign a star striker.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nWhen it comes to bringing in a striker of legitimate pedigree, Arsenal keep delaying something that should have happened a long time ago. Three years ago in January, Arsenal were in a similar situation after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was exiled. Arteta needed a striker, and there was a possibility of attaining the services of Alexander Isak. The club refused to pay the Real Sociedad's $92m release clause and decided to wait until the summer, but Arsenal finished fifth in the league and missed out on the Champions League to Tottenham, while Newcastle pounced to sign Isak for an initial $70m. The following season, Edu joined the club as their first-ever sporting director to help Arteta materialize his vision.\n\nBack to the present. Edu left the club a few months ago, and we're back to the same hesitancy. Arsenal made a $45m bid for the 29-year-old Watkins, but reports suggest Villa may have listened for offers north of $60m. But just like the Isak situation from 2022, Arsenal's cautious vibes could once again cost them the title. They remind me of an inexperienced Vegas tourist playing blackjack and following the advice that you should always stick to No. 13. No matter the season, Arsenal always stick to No. 13.\n\nThe other part that bothers me is that there seems to be a lack of ingenuity and some tunnel vision here, because there were plenty of tremendous strikers available for a lower fee than Watkins. For example,Feyenoord's Santiago Gim\u00e9nez just left for AC Milan for approximately $40m. I think he could have been fantastic in North London, but alas, a golden chance missed for the Gunners and a gain for the Rossoneri.\n\nHow about Liam Delap? He certainly fits a lot of the characteristics. Would Ipswich Town have listened? We'll never know, as once again in this window, a striker didn't arrive at Arsenal because they stuck to No. 13.\n\nSOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN\n\nI don't know what to make of Tottenham's moves\n\nplay 1:04 What are Tottenham getting with Mathys Tel signing? Julien Laurens explains why he thinks of new Spurs signing Mathys Tel as the \"complete package\" when it comes to forwards.\n\nI'm cautious on Spurs, and that's why I didn't have them in either category because the jury is still out on how they did.\n\nWe have heard about the talent of Mathys Tel (loan from Bayern Munich, with a $60m option to sign permanently), who was pretty much wanted by every top club if we're to believe the reports in January. But after 344+ minutes of action this season, he hadn't scored a goal with Bayern and despite his obvious talent, there's inconsistency. I get it. He's 19. There's still a lot to come from the young man and I sincerely hope he shines with Tottenham, but Ange Postecoglou doesn't need a project. He needs an end product.\n\nGoalkeeper Antonin Kinsky, 21, from Slavia Prague ($16m) has been thrown in the deep end and delivered. He's a great addition. Kevin Danso (from Lens for approximately $26m) is a very good center-back too, so there are pluses for sure. But I still think they needed a stable, game-changing midfielder because Tottenham have always had that. From Glenn Hoddle to Luka Modric, it's always been part of their DNA, and they're still missing that aspect. Spurs fans will yell James Maddison to me, but he is not as stable or anchored in the midfield as the names I mentioned because he plays just behind the striker.\n\nAnyway, Postecoglou has a lot to worry about, including an ACL injury to Radu Dr\u0103gu\u0219in and the continued absence of Cristian Romero. They're being very careful with the latter. The same is true of Micky van de Ven, who didn't play against Brentford despite returning in the Europa League.\n\nSo yes, Spurs made some good decisions in January, but they didn't get much extra depth in defence and there was a gamble on a very talented, somewhat inconsistent attacker. I hope he delivers for the sake of the club.",

                "text": "Stevie Nicol says there was no drama as Liverpool moves on to the Carabao Cup final with a 4-0 thrashing of Tottenham. (1:00)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nLIVERPOOL, England -- As the majority of Liverpool's players flocked to celebrate with Cody Gakpo after he had opened the scoring against Tottenham Hotspur, captain Virgil van Dijk had other ideas.\n\nThough there were only 34 minutes on the clock at Anfield when Liverpool drew level on aggregate in their Carabao Cup semifinal tie before eventually winning 4-0 -- Gakpo's strike had cancelled out Lucas Bergvall's first-leg match-winner -- Van Dijk knew there was still work to be done.\n\nPerhaps it is that insatiable hunger for more, that sets this Liverpool team apart from the rest this season.\n\nNot content with having climbed to the summit of both the Premier League and UEFA Champions League tables in recent months, Arne Slot's men are now just 90 minutes away from potentially lifting the first trophy of what could be a truly historic campaign, with second-half goals from Mohamed Salah, Dominik Szoboszlai, and Van Dijk setting up a date with Newcastle United in the final at Wembley.\n\nEven before kick-off, there was a palpable sense of expectation around Anfield, with supporters queueing in their droves to welcome the team coach to the stadium while, on the terraces, the atmosphere was akin to a European night.\n\nLiverpool might harbour ambitions of yielding more prestigious silverware this term, but this is a club whose very foundations are built on winning, and, with every passing week, Slot's team looked increasingly capable of upholding that proud tradition.\n\nThe contrast between Liverpool and their visitors on Thursday night was stark. Tottenham arrived on Merseyside off the back of consecutive victories over Elfsborg and Brentford, though they had won only three of their previous 10.\n\nShorn of both confidence and quality -- with 10 first-team players missing Thursday's clash through injury -- Tottenham struggled to lay a glove on Liverpool in the first half, managing only 27% possession and just one shot compared to Liverpool's 11.\n\nSlot had commented pre-match about his excitement for his first knockout tie at Anfield, and Liverpool delivered both on and off the pitch, with Gakpo's opener sending the home support into a fist-pumping, scarf-swirling frenzy. The Netherlands international finished with aplomb past goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky after connecting with Salah's dangerous cross into the box.\n\nIn many ways, Gakpo is the perfect poster boy for Liverpool's success this term, having progressed from an out-of-form utility player in Jurgen Klopp's final season to one of Slot's most trusted lieutenants, with 16 goals so far in all competitions this season. An understated character off the pitch, Gakpo is rarely one to grab the headlines, but he is a vital cog in a team whose greatest strength is their unity and willingness to fight for each other.\n\nTottenham's fight, however, was ruthlessly sapped out of them after the interval as Liverpool smelt blood and went for the jugular. Salah's coolly taken penalty -- after Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez was brought down by Kinsky inside the area -- put Liverpool ahead in the tie before Szoboszlai's smart finish provided the killer blow to Tottenham's Wembley dream.\n\nLiverpool will look to win their first piece of silverware under Arne Slot as they will face Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final. (Photo by Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nThat the Hungary international was teed up by right-back Conor Bradley following a lung-busting run through the middle of the pitch offers further evidence of the industriousness that Slot demands.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold sidelined with a minor injury, Bradley deputised admirably, fearlessly sliding into tackles and constantly looking to get forward. The fact that Liverpool's reserve full-back is capable of such brilliance is a testament to the strength of the squad that Klopp assembled and Slot has honed.\n\nIt was fitting, too, that Van Dijk got on the scoresheet, nodding home from a late corner to cap off a fine individual display. It was the Dutchman who was the matchwinner in last season's final against Chelsea and his importance to this team has only been reinforced this season.\n\nEnsuring that Van Dijk stays at Anfield beyond the expiration of his contract this summer feels imperative. Tottenham would certainly benefit from a player with his quality and leadership abilities at the moment.\n\nHaving boldly claimed earlier in the campaign that he \"always\" wins a trophy in his second season at a club, Spurs head coach Ange Postecoglou has arguably just waved goodbye to his greatest chance of silverware this season. There were still 10 minutes to play on Thursday night when hordes of travelling fans began heading for the exit, while the Liverpool supporters taunted the Tottenham boss with chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning.\"\n\nThat Slot was heavily linked with the Spurs job following Antonio Conte's departure back in 2023 will surely be further salt in the wound for those of a Tottenham persuasion. For Liverpool, though, the Dutchman continues to defy expectations and has already created an impressive synergy between himself, his players, and the fans.\n\n\"It was so intense,\" Slot said of his team's performance after the game.\n\n\"The players were ready for it, the fans were ready for it and we all simply wanted one thing that was going through to the final. That mentality, we showed it from the first to the last second.\"\n\nOf course, Slot -- like Van Dijk on Thursday night -- knows there is still work to do if this season of enormous promise is to become one of prosperity for Liverpool. But, based on current evidence, the league leaders look like they will take some stopping.",

(1:00)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nTottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has described external criticism of his team as \"irrelevant\" following their 4-1 aggregate defeat to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semifinals.\n\nSpurs took a slender advantage into the second leg at Anfield thanks to Lucas Bergvall's late winner in north London last month. However, they were comprehensively beaten by Arne Slot's side on Merseyside thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Dominik Szoboszlai and Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe manner of the defeat will only heighten the pressure on Postecoglou as his team's dismal campaign continues, with Sky Sports pundit and former Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp condemning his former club's performance at Anfield.\n\n\"I cannot remember a team in my lifetime go down with less of a fight with what Spurs did today,\" Redknapp said.\n\nAnge Postecoglou's Tottenham are enduring a season to forget. Carl Recine/Getty Images\n\nReflecting on those comments, Postecoglou said: \"People are on TV to give opinions. That's their job. My job is to manage this football club. What other people think or don't think is kind of irrelevant. It doesn't place any kind of emphasis on who we are or what we're trying to do. At the end of the day, everyone is allowed to have an opinion and express that opinion.\"\n\nAsked whether he feels the criticism being levelled at him is fair considering Tottenham's lengthy injury list, Postecoglou added: \"I don't worry about being judged or who's judging me. Ultimately my responsibility is to try and get the players I have to the best of my ability.\n\n\"It was disappointing tonight because we had an opportunity to get to a final and they don't come around too often.\"\n\nSpurs' Carabao Cup disappointment comes on the back of their disappointing Premier League campaign -- they sit 14th in the table and have lost 13 of their 23 games so far this season.\n\nDespite the damaging defeat at Anfield, Postecoglou and Spurs still have the opportunity to end the season with silverware if they find success in the Europa League or FA Cup.\n\nThe north London club have qualified for the Europa League round of 16 and travel to face Aston Villa in the fourth round of the world's oldest national football competition on Sunday.",

                "text": "We're nearly at the end of 2020, which means it's time for ESPN's annual ranking of the best men's players and coaches in world soccer! Welcome to the FC 100.\n\nThis year, our fifth edition of the countdown has a lot of surprises and new faces -- more on that later -- as well as two teams rising above the rest to dominate the list. As always, our list is broken down into 10 Top 10s for every position on the pitch as well as managers, making for the most meaningful and deep look at the talent across the men's game from goalkeeper to striker.\n\nJump to: Goalkeepers | Right-back | Centre-back | Left-back | Central midfield | Attacking midfield | Wing | Forward | Striker | Manager\n\nRead the FC 100 in: Spanish | Portuguese\n\nPrevious editions of the FC 100: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016\n\nThe top spots were dominated by two clubs: Bayern Munich, winners of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League, and Liverpool, winners of their first league title in 30 years. They claimed every No. 1 spot except for two, ATTACKING MIDFIELD and FORWARD -- see if you can guess who took those prizes? -- as our voters leaned into their on-field domination.\n\nA couple of other themes emerged in this year's ranking, too:\n\n-- New names, new faces\n\nThis was arguably the most diverse and most refreshed FC 100 since we began in 2016. Nearly half the list -- 47 out of 100 -- were either new to the FC 100 or not ranked in 2019, which reflects not only the challenges of the 2019-20 season amid the coronavirus pandemic but also the turnover of top players and the generational \"passing of the guard\" to a younger group of superstars. Erling Haaland (Borussia Dortmund), Achraf Hakimi (Inter Milan) and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) all pop up after transcendent seasons, as do Leon Goretzka (Bayern), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa) and Houssem Aouar (Lyon).\n\nThis kind of refreshment is exactly what we're seeing in the game as aging legends fade and new stars are made.\n\n-- Americans are back?\n\nIt might not seem like much, but after being shut out in 2019 for many reasons, the USMNT gets two into the 100 this time around: Christian Pulisic returns -- after a stellar 2020 until injuries hit -- and Sergino Dest, a newcomer to the U.S. scene since choosing to rep the Yanks late last year. Dest cracked the Top 10 at right-back after a superb campaign with Ajax, a summer transfer saga with Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and an eventual move to the Spanish giants, where he became the first U.S. player to start in a Clasico, as well as the first American to score a goal for the storied club.\n\nBut enough preamble; here's how we did the list.\n\nTo compile the 2020 edition of the FC 100, 65 ESPN FC experts (from editors to writers, TV talent to former players) from around the world were given a list of about 250 players and managers to make their selections.\n\nHere's the key: We didn't use one megalist with all players mixed together -- such conceits inevitably favor attackers, because everyone loves a good goal, don't they? But that isn't fair to those engaged in the dark arts at the back. So instead, we broke down the world's best players by position in a 4-3-3 formation, plus manager. Each expert then contributed a Top 10 for each category, and we crunched the numbers and did a final review with a select few writers.\n\nAgree with our picks? Disagree? Now comes the fun part. FC 100: It. Is. On.\n\nNOTE: All player ages are as of Nov. 20\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe modern goalkeeper isn't just there to stop shots. He's also the first step in building attacks; whether with a long, accurate throw or a raking crossfield pass, it's the first major evolution for the position since the \"sweeper-keeper\" became a thing thanks to Manuel Neuer. Agility and reflexes are a given, but confidence, vision and assertive play are vital, too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Elaine Teng\n\nClub/country: Man United/Spain\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nDe Gea has been a constant through United's many ups and downs since he joined the club in 2011. He has faced a lot of criticism over the past nine years -- some fans think he should be dropped for 23-year-old Dean Henderson -- but De Gea is tied for the most Premier League clean sheets in United's history (112, shared with Peter Schmeichel) and made the second-most PL appearances (411) between the posts. Last season, only Liverpool and Manchester City conceded fewer goals, a huge part of why the Red Devils managed to finish third despite a poor start.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Between February and July, De Gea kept nine clean sheets -- the most in the league -- to help United go from seventh to third (and likely saving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's job at the same time).\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Slovenia\n\nAge: 36\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nLast season, Inter fell one point short of seizing the Serie A crown from Juventus and made it to the Europa League final. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez got much of the praise, but credit should also go to Handanovic's rock-solid performances between the posts. Inter conceded the fewest goals in the league, and their wily captain kept 13 clean sheets. At 36, his reflexes remain sharp, his presence imposing, and he's super adept at the full-stretch highlight save.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A superb save against Getafe's Nemanja Maksimovic helped Inter through to the Europa League quarterfinal and, ultimately, the final.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/Italy\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nConsider this: Donnarumma made his Serie A debut five years ago, has played over 200 games for Milan and is firmly established as the legendary Gianluigi Buffon's successor for Italy. And he's 21 years old. Despite his club's managerial chaos and financial turmoil, he has been a pillar of calm and consistency, keeping at least 10 clean sheets in each of his five seasons and steadily improving his passing accuracy. The Rossoneri are off to a flying start this term, and the sooner they can tie Donnarumma down -- his contract expires next summer -- the better their chances at long-term success.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the goals in Milan's 2-1 derby win over Inter, but Donnarumma made a key save against Romelu Lukaku in his first game back after testing positive for the coronavirus to cement their victory.\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Costa Rica\n\nAge: 33\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas doesn't get as much attention as many of his colleagues on this list, but that doesn't make him less deserving. At Real Madrid, his teammates used to call him \"Keylor Paras\" (\"Keylor Stops\"), and he's lived up to that name after moving to Paris. In his first season at PSG, he kept five clean sheets -- trailing Bayern's Manuel Neuer by just one despite playing 191 fewer minutes -- to guide his team to the Champions League final. In terms of European success, few can usurp him: He has played in four of the past five Champions League finals -- and won three of them.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Making save after save against Atalanta in the Champions League quarterfinal to keep PSG's hopes alive before Neymar & Co. orchestrated a dramatic late comeback.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nAt his best, Ederson can feel like an extra outfield player who also happens to be fantastic at stopping shots. The perfect keeper for Pep Guardiola's brand of possession-based football, his scarily accurate long balls start many a City attack. City have struggled with injuries and have been uncharacteristically fragile at the back, but last season Ederson still managed to keep 16 clean sheets, earning him the Premier League Golden Glove. As they look to wrest the league title back from Liverpool, City will need him at his best on both offense and defense.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Raheem Sterling scored the winner against Arsenal in October, but Ederson made spectacular saves to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka to get City back on track.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nReal Madrid didn't always look as though they would win the league last season, but Courtois was a giant in goal. He conceded 20 goals in 34 league matches, kept 18 clean sheets and boasted the highest save percentage in La Liga. But he has been known for making some outrageous gaffes now and again. In November, during a Nations League match against Denmark, the Belgian No. 1 let a back pass roll straight past him into goal. If Belgium, the top-ranked team in the world, are to win the Euros next year, Courtois will need all of his focus.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his first La Liga title with Real Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Germany\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nIn September 2019, Ter Stegen rushed out of the penalty area, beat a Getafe attacker to the ball and played a long pass into the opposite box for Luis Suarez to calmly lob into the goal. That assist was classic Ter Stegen, a confident sweeper-keeper who's comfortable with the ball at his feet and can convert saves into counterattacks in a flash. The German doesn't get as much attention in a team full of attacking superstars, but he plays a pivotal role in Ronald Koeman's plans as he looks to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Claiming his second career assist in December 2019, when Antoine Griezmann ran onto his goal kick to score against Mallorca.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/Slovenia\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nIn the six seasons Oblak has tended the Atletico goal, they've conceded fewer than 30 goals each campaign. The efficient, reserved Slovenian is the perfect keeper for Diego Simeone's hardworking, disciplined side. He made nine saves -- more than any keeper in the tournament -- in a man-of-the-match performance away at Liverpool in last season's Champions League to send Atletico through to the quarterfinals. There are more glamorous players in football, but few are as consistent or as effective.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool had 72% possession and 34 shots at the Wanda Metropolitano in March, but they couldn't get past Oblak.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe consummate modern goalkeeper, Alisson can turn defense into offense in the blink of an eye. Equally calm on the ball with his hands and his feet, he was instrumental in Liverpool's charge to their first Premier League trophy in three decades. In January, he even notched an assist when he played a long upfield pass to Mohamed Salah, who made it 2-0 against Manchester United. (Alisson was so delighted he sprinted the length of the pitch, past all of his teammates, to celebrate with the Egypt international.) Liverpool's long injury list this season, especially in central defense, means Alisson is more crucial to their hopes of retaining the title than ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helping Liverpool end their 30-year wait for a Premier League title.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Neuer and Alisson finished tied on overall points after the tallying of ballots, but Neuer was awarded first place by virtue of receiving more first-place votes from the FC voters, with 19 to Alisson's 18.\n\nGermany's sweeper-keeper looked to be slowing down as he reached his mid-30s, but in the past 12 months, the 34-year-old has been back at his imperious best. Seven years since he most recently won a treble with Bayern, Neuer lifted the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies in 2020 as club captain. He made a string of crucial stops in the Champions League final to deny PSG, including a spectacular double save against Neymar. In October, he kept his 200th clean sheet for Bayern, a club record. At times it seems attackers are intimidated just knowing he's in goal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his second Champions League title, though an eighth consecutive Bundesliga trophy is no small feat, either.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nRIGHT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nAt one point, right-backs were considered the least skilled players on the pitch, but the next generation brings boldness and unpredictability. Positional awareness, pinpoint crossing and breakneck pace separate the best from the rest.\n\nPlayer capsules by Stephan Uersfeld\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/United States\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nIt's been an incredible year for the young defender. After just one season and 23 appearances for Ajax's first team since debuting in July 2019, Dest has been on a dizzying upward trajectory, becoming the first American to sign for La Liga giants Barcelona after being involved in a transfer saga that also included Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Not the worst options! The Dutch-born player, capable of playing either full-back position, is considered one of the best young U.S. internationals since committing in October 2019, and he has already shown in four appearances for Barca that he can solve their issues at right-back.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Starting the Clasico, becoming the first American to feature in Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, and even winning Barca's man-of-the-match award in the 3-1 defeat.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nNow in his second La Liga season with Atleti, Trippier has fully embraced his new life away from Tottenham and the Premier League. He's an integral part of Diego Simeone's first XI and has started and finished every match of the 2020-21 season. Playing at right-back at the club level, he's versatile enough to play a more advanced role for England, featuring as a wing-back in Gareth Southgate's 3-4-2-1 formation. Though England have a lot of competition for full-back spots, Trippier's experience, work rate and pinpoint accuracy with crosses could be crucial in the Three Lions' bid to compete at the Euros in the summer.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Trippier's best moment came in a \"return\" to England. In one of the last big matches played in front of fans before the coronavirus shut down the sport, Trippier was instrumental in Atletico's 3-2 win at Liverpool back in March, ably shutting Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson down before coming off in extra time.\n\nClub/country: Leicester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe dynamic defender started all but one of Leicester's 29 Premier League matches before the pandemic, but we're still waiting to see him back in action. His absence due to an ACL injury has been a major challenge for the Foxes, who have missed Pereira's pace and poise on the flank. Before that, Pereira had been involved in 471 duels, more than any other defender across the top five leagues in Europe. Without Pereira, Leicester dropped out of the Champions League spots at the end of the 2019-20 season, proof of his importance to Brendan Rodgers' plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's rare for defenders to show up on the scoresheet, but Pereira put together a superb game against West Ham in January, notching a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Netherlands\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThriving in his role at wing-back for Atalanta, Hateboer was an integral part of one of Europe's most exciting teams last term as the unheralded Italian side came within a late PSG goal of reaching the Champions League semifinals. A force in aerial duels and his side's intricate passing game, he pairs a superhuman work rate with positional intelligence in a demanding position. The 26-year-old was snapped up by Atalanta from Dutch side Groningen for less than a million euros in 2017 and has since become a fixture in the Dutch national team. There's every chance he'll take another step up next summer and move to one of the European giants.\n\nHigh point of 2020: An impressive two-goal performance in the Champions League round of 16, first leg, against Valencia. Not only was it his only game with goals in 2019-20 but it put the tiny Serie A side into the Champions League's last eight in Lisbon.\n\nplay 0:57 Is FC 100 winner Mane the smartest player at Liverpool? Gab Marcotti believes Sadio Mane \"smartness\" is one of the reasons he tops ESPN's FC 100.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Spain\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas didn't hold back his tears when Sevilla won the 2019-20 Europa League in Germany this summer. Having begun his senior career at the club in 2003, winning two UEFA Cups and two Copa del Reys, clinching the Europa League at age 34 was seen as just reward for the Spain international. Indeed, he seemingly has gotten better with age since leaving Manchester City for his boyhood club in 2017.\n\nHigh point of 2020: As team captain, Navas contributed an assist against Inter Milan in the final as Sevilla won the competition for the sixth time since 2005.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nA reliable defender under Pep Guardiola, Walker might not have the attacking power of Trent Alexander-Arnold or Achraf Hakimi, for example, but he's been one of the steadier City performers since joining the club in 2017. On the pitch, he patrols City's right side with high tempo, physicality and an unrivalled intensity. In his 30s and with an apparent leadership void in the City squad since Vincent Kompany's exit, Walker has been a vital lieutenant for Guardiola.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner -- but not celebrating it! -- against one of his former clubs, Sheffield United, in his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nIt's hard to find anyone more consistent at right-back over the past couple of years. He has fended off the threat of losing his place in Madrid's first XI with another outstanding season, looking so good that his presumed replacement, Achraf Hakimi, returned from a loan at Borussia Dortmund only to be sold to Inter Milan. Carvajal isn't a flashy right-back, known more for his work behind the ball, but he's also been a superb support to Karim Benzema whenever he's able to get forward and play crosses into the box. Carvajal was a part of the Real side that won La Liga for the first time since 2016-17, and despite his missing the start of the campaign through injury, his imminent return will boost Zinedine Zidane's squad immensely.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was superb in both Clasico clashes last season, results that played a key role in Real Madrid's title challenge.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPavard is still far from being a household name, though the young defender was arguably Bayern Munich's unsung hero of a Treble-winning season. Having joined from relegated VfB Stuttgart in 2019, he provided the stability at right-back that allowed Joshua Kimmich to move into a permanent defensive midfield role. Less attacking than some of his Bundesliga right-back peers like Hakimi, he still scored four goals and set up seven in all competitions in his debut season at the Allianz Arena. The \u20ac35 million transfer fee for the France defender looks to be a bargain even though his unspectacular style of play gets him few plaudits. Oh, and Pavard is also capable of putting in a shift at centre-back to further enhance Bayern's myriad options.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In his first league match under Hansi Flick, Pavard was superb, notching an assist as Bayern demolished Borussia Dortmund 4-0 midway through last season.\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Morocco\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nA spectacular, adventurous two-way player capable of brilliance on either side of the ball, Hakimi has fast become one of the best right-backs in world soccer. After scoring six goals and providing six assists for Dortmund last season and forming a superb relationship with England star Jadon Sancho while on loan in the Bundesliga, Hakimi joined Inter Milan this summer and has continued to entertain on the wing. One of the fastest defenders in the game, his sloppy passes have caused headaches for teammates at times, though he is always quick to make up for mistakes with attacking contributions.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Down 2-0 at half-time, Hakimi's brace in the Champions League group-stage match against Inter Milan turned around the tie for Dortmund (they went on to win 3-2).\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe kid from Liverpool is living the dream at Anfield. Liverpool followed up their remarkable Champions League win in 2018-19 with their first league title in 30 years, and Alexander-Arnold once again was vital to the Reds' success. The young defender, who was originally a midfielder in the Liverpool academy, continues to define, and redefine, what full-back play can be in the modern game. His set pieces are a constant threat, and his crosses cause havoc in the penalty area. The England international remains on the way up, but a muscle injury has curtailed his progress this season. That said, the future looks bright for a player who has won 77 of 101 Premier League appearances for his boyhood club.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notching two assists for Virgil van Dijk in the 2-1 win against Brighton in late November, both from set pieces. It was one of the key wins for Liverpool en route to their first-ever Premier League title.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRE-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nBeing a great central defender requires more than size, assertiveness and strength. Some of the modern greats are cultured in possession; others are the epitome of no-nonsense force. The best central defenders combine timing and power with elegance and poise under pressure.\n\nPlayer capsules by Tom Hamilton\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Brazil\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nThe PSG defender was at the forefront of the Ligue 1 champions' journey to the Champions League final in 2019-20. His versatility means PSG boss Thomas Tuchel sometimes uses him in the heart of their midfield, but that has been a bone of contention, with sporting director Leonardo keen to see Marquinhos at centre-back. Wherever he plays, the Brazilian is influential. He's seen as the long-term successor for Thiago Silva, who left for Chelsea in the summer, and is not afraid to speak his mind when asked for his opinion. This made him the perfect candidate to be PSG's new captain, with the club's former defender Jean-Marc Pilorget describing Marquinhos as \"unflappable on the field.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Superb in PSG's Champions League campaign, scoring two key goals against Atalanta and RB Leipzig to help the side into the final.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nRated as one of the world's best young centre-backs, Kounde's brilliant season led to a \"magnificent\" transfer offer from Manchester City, according to Monchi, the club's sporting director. Monchi later praised Kounde's response to the rejected bid, saying he displayed \"professional and respectful behaviour.\" City eventually went for Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias, but Manchester United are also interested in the man who now has his sights on supplanting Raphael Varane and Dayot Upamecano with the France national team. Having moved to Sevilla from Bordeaux for \u00a322.5m ahead of the 2019-20 season, he's since helped them to the Europa League title last season and is an important figure in their Champions League aspirations this term.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Had plenty of eye-catching performances last season, but was singularly magnificent in their quarterfinal win over Wolves in the Europa League.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Netherland\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe Dutch centre-back completed his big-money, \u20ac75 million move to Juventus ahead of the 2019-20 campaign and, in doing so, followed in the footsteps of his idols, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. Initially, then-coach Maurizio Sarri planned to integrate him slowly, but Giorgio Chiellini's long-term injury saw the young defender thrust into the first team. He made a shaky start, but despite battling a shoulder injury in 2020-21, he's become an integral part of the Juventus defence. Juve's 2-0 win at Bologna in June was the match in which De Ligt really announced himself in Serie A. \"He was only born in 1999, and he has been catapulted into a new way of playing. He's smart,\" Chiellini said of De Ligt. The CIES Football Observatory ranks De Ligt as the most valuable central defender in the world, putting his current value at an eye-watering \u20ac105m.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Neatly summed up in his performance against Lyon in the final 16 of the Champions League when he battled on despite having his head cut open early in the match.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/France\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nLaporte's importance at Manchester City is perhaps best illustrated by his absence. There's a popular school of thought that if Laporte hadn't suffered a knee injury that ruled him out for four months, the Premier League title race would have been far closer last season. \"We have missed him a lot; he's the best left central defender in the world,\" City boss Pep Guardiola said of Laporte. \"Imagine the best teams in the world lose their best central defender. He is fast, strong in the air.\" Laporte is one half of a formidable partnership at the back for City alongside new signing Ruben Dias, and they will form the foundations for another push for trophies. Laporte is still waiting to make his debut for the French national team, such are Didier Deschamps' embarrassment of riches for France, but it's a matter of when, not if.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Simply seeing him back in action after a long layoff. Laporte is so important to City that Guardiola had to warn against his return back in January being seen as the single answer to solving all of their defensive worries.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nYet another French international on the list, Varane is one-half of Real Madrid's formidable partnership alongside Sergio Ramos, though the 27-year-old has endured a mixed 2020. He was indispensable in Real's watertight rear guard en route to the league title, with Los Blancos conceding just six in 11 games after the restart, and Varane's friends and teammates, like France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, aren't concerned. \"He is a great champion above all else,\" Lloris said. \"He has great experience. He is a leader in our team.\" And his Real Madrid teammate Eden Hazard has also been impressed: \"I've come across some fantastic defenders during my career, such as John Terry and Vincent Kompany. I think that although [Varane] is still young, he's already one of the best centre-backs of all time.\" Despite questions over his form -- he still ranks fourth in Europe's big five leagues for aerial defensive duels won this season -- he always fronts up, takes responsibility and seeks improvement.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 32 league games as Real clinched their first La Liga crown since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: RB Leipzig/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe young Frenchman has been linked with just about every European giant after another strong season, with Manchester United and Bayern Munich reportedly at the front of the queue. \"As for the future, I'm not sure [if Upamecano will stay] as he is very talented,\" Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann told ESPN. \"Lots of clubs will want to buy him -- perhaps next season, it could be real that he leaves the club.\" Even though he's just 22, Upamecano plays with authority at the back, unafraid to carry the ball out of defence but also positionally aware to know when to take a safer option. Alongside Kounde, Kurt Zouma and Aymeric Laporte, he's one of a number of brilliant defenders at France boss Didier Deschamps' disposal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In a season when RB Leipzig got to the semifinals of the Champions League, he was at his commanding best in their quarterfinal win against Atletico Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Napoli/Senegal\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThere's not a transfer window that goes by without a handful of the European giants being linked with the Napoli defender. The latest team to chase the 6-foot-5 Senegal international was PSG in the summer, but Napoli were resolute in rejecting any offers that fell short of their \u20ac75m asking price. \"I had no doubts, he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role,\" Napoli boss Gennaro Gattuso said in September of Koulibaly. He's now his national team's captain and was rated by ex-Spain goalkeeper Pepe Reina as the best centre-back he's played behind. The future remains uncertain for Koulibaly with a number of teams forever linked with him -- Liverpool could go back in for him amid their defensive injury crisis -- but for now, he is indispensable to Napoli.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Though Napoli finished second to Juventus again in the league, Koulibaly was superb in the Coppa Italia final as his side bested the league champions on penalties.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Austria\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 2 (left-back)\n\nWhat can you say about one of the most versatile defenders in the modern game? Alaba started last season at left-back under previous coach Niko Kovac, only to finish it as a triple-winning centre-back. The Austrian player's contract is up at the end of the season, and Bayern Munich are bracing for his exit -- expect the likes of Liverpool to be interested. Bayern manager Hansi Flick says Alaba \"holds the defence together,\" while Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in August likened Alaba's impact at centre back to the transformational qualities of Franz Beckenbauer. \"We haven't had a 'chief' in defence for some time now, one who really takes the reins in hand and sets the tone there and simply acts as the head of the defensive unit -- he did that,\" Rummenigge said.\n\nHigh point of 2020: There were numerous standout moments for Alaba, but the past 12 months will be remembered as the time Bayern Munich swept all before them, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nThe Real Madrid talisman continues to be a polarising figure, but love him or hate him, he is a truly remarkable player. His Real teammate Toni Kroos calls him the \"absolute captain\" and the \"best you can have.\" Despite his age, Ramos would still walk into most sides and will be a top free agent if he opts against extending his stay at Real Madrid after this season. In the meantime, he continues to set records, having passed the 100-goal mark for Los Blancos and also set a record with his 45th El Clasico appearance when Real Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in late October. Ramos is still indispensable for Spain at the international level, too, with Luis Enrique calling him a \"unique, different level\" defender, and he recently set a record there as well, with his 177th Spain cap against Germany, the most appearances at international level for anyone in the men's game in Europe.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Los Blancos supporters will remember his key penalties in Real's back-to-back 1-0 wins over Getafe and Athletic Bilbao in July, as they continued their charge to the 2019-20 La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Netherlands\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nIt's testament to Van Dijk that when he suffered his season-ending injury against Everton in October, the mood around Liverpool changed. Gigi Wijnaldum said that the squad had suffered \"sleepless nights,\" while Jurgen Klopp admits Van Dijk is irreplaceable. \"Every team in the world would miss Virgil van Dijk,\" Klopp said soon after his injury. \"He is the best in the world.\" Up to that injury, the Dutch international had missed just one Premier League game for Liverpool after signing from Southampton for \u00a375m in January 2018.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing every single minute (and scoring five goals) in Liverpool's 2019-20 Premier League-winning season, the club's first league title in 30 years. Need we say more?\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nLEFT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nTop left-backs are as comfortable locking down an opposing winger as they are turning into one when their teams are in possession. Some aren't even left-footed, using their positional awareness to drift infield and be another central defender or midfielder if needed.\n\nIn the modern era, no positions touch the ball more than full-back, making the best of them simply indispensable.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 7\n\nMendy established himself as Real Madrid's undisputed first-choice left-back this year after coach Zinedine Zidane requested his signing in the summer of 2019. In the biggest games, against Barcelona in La Liga or Manchester City in the Champions League, Mendy -- not Marcelo -- gets the nod. Mendy might lack his teammate's eye-catching skills, but he offers a defensive solidity that helped the team keep clean sheet after clean sheet post-lockdown. He's no slouch going forward, either.\n\nHigh point of 2020: His only goal for the club so far, a thunderous near-post finish against Granada as Real Madrid closed in on the La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nMarcelo's reputation and history -- and Real Madrid's title win -- see him make this list even though, by his own standards, he had a disappointing year. The 32-year-old started fewer than half of Real Madrid's games in 2019-20, and the defensive lapses that have made him an occasional liability during a hugely successful club career became increasingly common. Since Zinedine Zidane returned for his second spell in charge, in 2019, Madrid have lost nine league games, and Marcelo started all of them. No one doubts his talent and personality, though, and on his day, there are few footballers who are more fun to watch.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his fifth league title in 14 years as a Real Madrid player.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/England\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nChilwell was an important part of Leicester City's impressive 2019-20 campaign, and his August move to Chelsea -- after a drawn-out transfer saga that saw Leicester demand a world-record fee for a defender before accepting \"only\" \u00a350m -- cemented his status as one of English football's best young players. Wasting no time at Stamford Bridge, Chilwell provided a goal and assist on his Premier League debut. Coach Frank Lampard says he's \"fantastic,\" praising Chilwell's \"ability to be so high up the pitch when you want him.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: A glorious 90th-minute goal vs. Watford in Leicester's first game back in June, which was somewhat spoiled by Watford equalising three minutes later.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/France\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThis has been a year of rediscovery for the young Frenchman as he finally started to resemble the powerful, expansive full-back it was hoped he'd become when he graduated from the Atletico Madrid academy alongside his older brother, Lucas. Hernandez excelled on loan at Alaves in 2016-17, looked out of his depth at Real Madrid in 2017-18 and was decidedly average at Real Sociedad in 2018-19. At Milan, though, he's been a revelation. Hernandez scored six goals in Serie A last season, with Opta rating him as the best left-back in Italy.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A crisp, volleyed finish in a 3-2 win over Udinese in January.\n\nClub/country: Tottenham/Spain\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nArguably the best full-back in La Liga last season, Reguilon was a blur of constant movement on the left flank of Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla team as they cruised to a top-four league finish and won the Europa League. But, remarkably, Real Madrid chose to cash in, selling him to Tottenham off the back of that impressive loan. It's true that Real have a buyback clause, but why wait for a season or two? Reguilon is good enough to be starting for Real Madrid right now. In the meantime, he's become an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Spurs side, one that has a very real shot at winning the Premier League.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning the Europa League in his last game for Sevilla.\n\nClub/country: Borussia Dortmund/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGuerreiro doesn't attract the headlines of others on this list -- or of some high-profile teammates at Dortmund -- but he quietly had the best season of his career in 2019-20. Coach Lucien Favre's tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation helped enormously, enabling Guerreiro to operate in the wing-back role to which he is best suited while minimising the defects that hold him back as a pure full-back or winger. A well-rounded player, he contributed an impressive eight goals to Dortmund's second-placed Bundesliga finish. At 26, he's approaching his peak, and chose to sign a new deal in October 2019 despite reported interest from Barcelona and PSG.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring twice in Dortmund's 4-0 derby win over Schalke in May.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Brazil\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nTaking fourth place in our list for the fourth year in a row suggests Sandro is consistency personified. Into his sixth season at Juventus and soon to turn 30, he remains one of the most reliable performers in world football in his position. (Juventus were so excited about signing him in 2015 that they published a glowing story on the team website about his myriad qualities.) Sandro isn't quite as dangerous going forward as you might expect, though there aren't any real weaknesses to his game. Brazilian great Roberto Carlos said in 2015 that Sandro was his true \"successor,\" and few can argue with his assessment.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored Juventus' third goal in a 3-3 roller-coaster draw with Sassuolo, then cleared a potential winner off the line.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Spain\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nAlba is past his peak and looks to have been left behind by Spain at the international level, but he's still Barcelona's undisputed first-choice left-back. His link-ups with Lionel Messi -- once one of the most fruitful attacking partnerships in football -- remain dangerous, albeit less frequent. Alba has set up three goals this season under new coach Ronald Koeman. His defensive failings are well known, and unlikely to change at this stage. Barcelona have tried to prepare for life after Alba -- the Spain international will be 32 in March -- but Lucas Digne and Junior Firpo have already failed to supplant him at the Camp Nou.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Whatever it was, it wasn't Barca's 8-2 defeat to Bayern.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Canada\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nDavies' emergence as a world-class player has been thrilling to watch. Take his assist in Bayern's 8-2 Champions League demolition of Barcelona, when he evaded Lionel Messi, left Arturo Vidal on the floor and flummoxed Nelson Semedo before cutting the ball back for Joshua Kimmich to tap in. Was there a more memorable setup in 2020? \"I was almost ashamed of how happy I was after scoring, because it was 99% his goal,\" Kimmich said afterward, and it was hard to disagree.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That assist, obviously, though winning a domestic/European Treble with Bayern was also extremely special.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Scotland\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThis year's title win, ending Liverpool's 30-year wait, was the culmination of a remarkable journey for Robertson. In three years at Anfield, he's gone from Premier League prospect to, quite simply, the best left-back in the world. It almost seems wrong to call him \"left-back\" given how prolific he is in attack, racking up 23 assists in the past two Premier League seasons from a defensive position. In terms of creating chances, taking set pieces and working tirelessly off the ball, he is a cut above. He racked up his 100th Premier League appearance for the club, and the \u00a310m that Liverpool spent on Robertson in 2017 from Hull City increasingly looks like one of the best bits of transfer business ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool won the league.

There are many forms, too: the tough tackler, box-to-box machine and the nimble playmaker. It's about seeing the whole field -- and exploiting it.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Italy\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nIt has been a stop-start year for most players amid the coronavirus pandemic, but especially for Verratti. The French league decided to curtail the 2019-20 season in March, and when PSG eventually returned to competitive action in the French Cup final and Champions League in the summer, Verratti was injured. He reappeared as a substitute in the CL semifinal win over RB Leipzig before featuring for 25 minutes in the final against Bayern. However, while staying fit remains a problem, his absences from Thomas Tuchel's side serve only to highlight his importance. PSG are a different side with pass-master Verratti in their midfield, and he's also playing a big role in the rejuvenation of the Italian national team under Roberto Mancini.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Completing a domestic Treble with PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Croatia\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nModric might be in the twilight of his playing career, but he's still getting it done in one of the most demanding midfields and for one of the most demanding fan bases. The Croatian midfielder's ability on the ball and his vision of the game have always been his strong suit. It's how he casually guided Croatia to the World Cup final in 2018 and picked up the Ballon d'Or -- the first player not named Messi or Ronaldo to win it since 2007 -- in the same year. That's why Zinedine Zidane still trusts him to deliver at the highest level.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored his first-ever El Clasico goal last season as Real surged to the title at their rivals' expense.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Netherlands\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThe Dutch midfielder was the poster boy of European football when he joined Barca from Ajax for \u20ac70 million in 2019, but his first season in Spain showed him that not everything is always rosy in football. After excelling as the deepest midfielder at Ajax, he is playing a more attacking role under first Ernesto Valverde and later Quique Setien in Spain. Despite being moved around and having to adapt to a new country and a new language, De Jong showed glimpses of his talent, and there are signs of improvement in his second season at the club. Under his third coach at Camp Nou -- his compatriot Ronald Koeman -- he looks more comfortable in a \"double pivot\" (a pair of deep-lying midfielders who shield the defense and share creative responsibilities), and Barca hope he can rule their midfield for the next decade.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Has played every minute for Barcelona in La Liga this season.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nThe Brazilian won the Champions League in his first season with Liverpool and the Premier League title in his second. Not bad, right? He has excelled for Jurgen Klopp's side at the base of the midfield as an imposing figure who also offers a touch of class on the ball. He was incredible in the 3-1 win over Manchester City in November 2019, opening the scoring. His versatility is increasingly important, too. He played as a full-back earlier in his career at Real Madrid and AS Monaco, but is just as comfortable slotting into central defense for the Reds after a serious injury to Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played 28 games in Liverpool's first-ever Premier League title win.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere are more glamorous players at Liverpool, but England international Henderson took the plaudits for his side's Premier League triumph last season. For his performances on the pitch, his influence as the club's captain and his work with the #playerstogether initiative during the coronavirus lockdown, he's finally getting the respect his career has demanded. Henderson is not a highlight-reel player at the base of the Reds' midfield, but his hard work, unfussy style of play and passionate captaincy remain essential to the Reds' success. He's never been a player who captures the imagination at Liverpool -- or anywhere, for that matter -- but there's a reason his is the first name Jurgen Klopp puts on the team sheet.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A Premier League title, anyone?\n\nplay 1:00 Laurens: Mbappe will dominate for the next 10 years Julien Laurens believes Kylian Mbappe will be the next generational player once Messi and Ronaldo retire.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/France\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nEden Hazard once said that Kante is so good that he plays like two men in midfield, and who can argue? Understated and always willing to let more talented teammates get the glory, Kante is the perfect pivot for club and country. Though injuries and a positional change under then-Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri reduced his effectiveness, there are signs under Frank Lampard that he is refinding his best form. Back at the base of the midfield and with a stellar attack ahead of him, his relentless work in winning the ball back and distributing it could prove just as important as the goals and assists Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner contribute.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helped Chelsea to finish runner-up in the FA Cup despite missing much of the season through injury and concerns around COVID-19. Also passed 150 appearances for the club despite transfer interest from PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nTo classify Casemiro as a \"destroyer\" in midfield is to do the Brazil international a disservice. He offers much more to Madrid than just protection to the back four, and you could even argue he's become their most important player. When he doesn't play, Madrid struggle. He missed three league games last season, and Madrid won only one of them. Madrid conceded four at Valencia in November when he was absent with the coronavirus. He also has developed a knack for scoring important goals: twice in the 2-1 win against Sevilla last season, and the winner in the 1-0 victory at Espanyol as Madrid closed in on the league title. He was also on target against Borussia Monchengladbach in October as Zinedine Zidane's side came from behind to draw 2-2 in the Champions League. The other goal was scored by Karim Benzema, but guess who set it up? Casemiro.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games in the coronavirus-impacted La Liga season en route to the league title, his second since joining the club in 2013.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Germany\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nKroos is into his seventh season with Madrid and remains as important to Zinedine Zidane's side as ever. Take it from ZZ himself, who enjoys simply watching the German midfielder at practice. \"I love to watch Toni train,\" Zidane said. \"I love to be there for his training sessions. They're exceptional sessions. I'm not saying it for the sake of it. It's true. I've never seen him lose the ball. Well, maybe once. His game is always elegant and efficient. He never has a bad day.\" Even Pep Guardiola, who managed Kroos at Bayern Munich, raved about his former charge in a 2020 documentary: \"The players that shout the most are those that hide when things go badly. Toni is the opposite, he's the bravest of them all in the most difficult moments.\" Before last season, Kroos had won La Liga once, but his consistency in Madrid's 10-game winning run -- Casemiro said earlier this year that \"Real Madrid matches always go in Kroos' rhythm\" -- when football resumed in June helped Los Blancos end a three-year wait for the Spanish title.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games and adding several key assists on the way to Real's La Liga title, their first since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Spain\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThiago turned heads this summer when he signed for Liverpool, but it wasn't the transfer that shocked people; rather, it was the fact that other elite teams across Europe didn't put up a fight to sign him instead. Despite a string of challenging injuries throughout his career, Thiago has ability and creative skills that have never diminished. Even last season he missed the run-in in the Bundesliga, although before that he had been influential in Bayern's turnaround under Hansi Flick, and he returned in time for the Champions League knockout phase to exert his authority on the competition. At his best, he's a peerless deep-lying playmaker, perfect for unlocking packed defenses -- something Liverpool face often -- with a clever pass or swivel of the hips. He makes everything look so simple and was the best player on the pitch in the final in Lisbon -- completing 85 passes, more than any other player (Kimmich managed 78) -- as Bayern beat PSG to clinch the Treble.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Finishing his final season at Bayern in style, with a domestic/European Treble and, most notably, his first Champions League winners' medal since he got one with Barcelona in 2010-11.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 2 (right-back)\n\nKimmich is a coach's dream. Last season, he alternated effortlessly between the right-back and defensive midfield positions. He even filled in at centre-back occasionally, though coach Hansi Flick prefers him in midfield, especially since the sale of Thiago to Liverpool. For old time's sake, it was at right-back, with Benjamin Pavard returning from injury, where he took on the role of chief creator in Bayern's run to Champions League glory in the summer. He scored one and created four of his side's goals in the quarterfinal stage, including assisting the winner in the final for Kingsley Coman. Still just 25, he is Bayern's present and future.\n\nHigh point of 2020: He was instrumental in Bayern's first Champions League win since 2012-13, Jupp Heynckes' final season with the club.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nATTACKING MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe best attacking midfielders have a sense of mischief, capable of cracking a robust defensive set with improvisation or magic. Greats make the most of their free roles to entertain, create and convert.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Aston Villa/England\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nBig things have been expected from Grealish since he made his Premier League debut at 18 for Aston Villa in 2014. However, it's over only the past 12 months that he has really kicked on. He's a more mature, productive player on the pitch and, after helping Villa stay up on the final day of last season, he's started the new season in red-hot form for club and country. A midfielder who excels with the ball at his feet and who knows how to create space, it's not hard to understand why he's been linked to both Manchester United and Manchester City in 2020.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Grealish scored twice and set up three goals in Villa's extraordinary 7-2 win against Liverpool in October.\n\nClub/country: Lyon/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe Lyon side that reached the Champions League semifinal last season was brimming with talent, but the jewel in the Ligue 1 side's crown was undoubtedly Aouar. He tore apart Juventus and Manchester City in an advanced midfield role, setting up four of Lyon's five goals against the two European giants as they set up a final four meeting with eventual winners Bayern. A quick-footed creator with trickery in abundance, Aouar resisted a summer move to the Premier League, though it's just a matter of time until his skills enhance a bigger club and on a bigger stage.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Lyon to within 90 minutes of the Champions League final with a string of match-winning performances.\n\nClub/country: Man United/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nFew players divide opinion quite like Pogba. France teammate Antoine Griezmann told ESPN that Pogba is the \"most underrated player in the world,\" but not everyone would agree. He has arguably flattered to deceive since returning to Manchester United from Juventus for \u20ac100m in 2016 -- together, they've won just one League Cup and a Europa League in four seasons -- but the underlying feeling is that he is still one of the best box-to-box midfielders on his day. He is capable of the sublime, if he can stay fit. Last season was tainted by injuries -- he was restricted to 21 appearances, scoring just one goal -- but with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford and a settled XI under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the conditions are ripe for Pogba to show his best.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Setting up the crucial second goal after coming off the bench in a Champions League group stage win at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nSilva was not able to live up to his excellent 2018-19 campaign last season, but when on form, he remains one of Europe's most creative midfielders. Even so, he still managed to score six goals and record seven assists as Man City finished second in the Premier League in 2019-20. However, he didn't even make it off the bench as City were stunned by Lyon in the Champions League quarterfinal when the tournament resumed in August. His aim this season is to win his place back in the City XI by rediscovering the form that led coach Pep Guardiola to say: \"Right now, it's Bernardo and 10 more players.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notched a goal and an assist against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semifinals, putting City on course to win their only trophy of the 2019-20 season.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/Germany\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nChelsea have lacked a dominant playmaker from midfielder for years, but in signing Havertz, the No. 10 spot is secured for years to come. Havertz is mature beyond his years: as a 20-year-old last season, he steered Bayer Leverkusen to a fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga with 12 goals. He also scored in four out of five Europa League games as Leverkusen reached the final eight, where they lost to eventual runners-up Inter Milan. Many expect him to become one of the best players in the world, and he's already a regular under Frank Lampard at Chelsea, who was \"overwhelmed\" with his new signing's humility and quiet confidence upon arrival in England.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Leverkusen to the final eight of the Europa League was good, but a hat trick in a League Cup win over Barnsley was a nice moment early in his Chelsea career.\n\nplay 1:40 Klopp the FC 100's best boss after 'historic' season Gab Marcotti explains how Jurgen Klopp beat Hansi Flick to the FC 100 best manager award.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGoretzka's physical transformation since signing for Bayern from Schalke has mirrored the German club's rise back to the top of European football. The once-slender midfielder looks more like a bodybuilder than a soccer star these days, having put on a tremendous amount of muscle. The extra bulk has helped keep him healthy, and Bayern benefit from his resilience: He was integral in Bayern's dominant Treble-winning season, weighing in with eight goals and 11 assists. \"The day I was unveiled at Bayern, I said I'd like to assume a role of responsibility within the team,\" Goretzka said this summer, \"and I'm moving more in that direction now. Maybe also imposing myself a bit more as I've got physically stronger. And that's a development I'm pleased with.\" Aggressive without being reckless and assertive without racking up yellow and red cards, Goretzka is, as former RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick puts it, \"the best box-to-box player in the world.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played a big role in Bayern's Treble-winning season.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Argentina\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGomez is one of the great Atalanta success stories. Plucked from Metalist Kharkiv for just \u00a34m in 2014, he's now regarded as one of the world's best midfielders. He even got a recall to the Argentina national team at the age of 32, three years after he won his fourth cap. He is arguably the frontman for this band of unfashionable players who have turned into European powerhouses under Gian Piero Gasperini. His record of seven goals and 16 assists in the Italian top flight belies his true influence: He is the conduit for his team's attack (a team that scored the most goals in the Italian top flight last season) and his form saw him named Serie A midfielder of the year.\n\nAs Atalanta captain, Gomez also played an important role in helping heal Bergamo. Atalanta's Lombardy region was hit hard by COVID-19 back in March, recording over 16,000 deaths because of the pandemic. Atalanta became a symbol of hope for that part of Italy, and their charge to the Champions League quarterfinals was as much for the region as it was for the players. During lockdown, Gomez used his social media platform to share \"life hacks\" such as how to repurpose plastic bottles, or offering indoor workout plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Returning to the Argentina national team after years without a call-up.\n\nClub/country: Manchester United/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nFernandes has been so good since signing for Manchester United for an initial fee of \u20ac55 million that it seems as though he's been there for years. In 14 Premier League appearances last season, he scored eight goals and created seven more, confirming that he could do in England what he'd done in Portugal, where he hit 20 goals in the Primeira Liga in 2018-19. Fernandes has done more of the same at the start of this season, with goals and match-winning performances against Brighton and Everton. He's not even been at Old Trafford for a year, but he's already United's talisman.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was instrumental in Man United's return to the Champions League and third-place finish in 2019-20.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNot only has Muller been one of the best players in the world over the past year, with his own unique sense of humour, but he's also one of the most entertaining. Muller was so good in the early 2010s they named a position after him -- the \"Raumdeuter\" (\"interpreter of space\") -- but the past season has been a seesaw of emotions. He started the 2019-20 season exiled under previous Bayern boss Niko Kovac and was contemplating leaving, but when Hansi Flick took charge, he put Muller slap-bang in the middle of his attacking lineup and Muller delivered. He finished the most recent campaign with a record-breaking 21 assists in the Bundesliga and helped Bayern deliver a remarkable Treble -- aided by his two goals in their 8-2 dismantling of Barcelona. His form has led to widespread calls for Joachim Low to bring him back in from the cold for Germany, but Low is still trying his best to ignore them.\n\nMuller has also provided us with a huge amount of enjoyment off the pitch. His social media account is wonderfully personable, and his impression of the Road Runner in describing Alphonso Davies' pace was brilliant. And he has now offered a second word into the football lexicon, with \"Lewan-goal-ski\" now alongside his very own position, even though he's not sure whether the definition fits his style. \"I'm always on the prowl. But I'm also more than just a 'Raumdeuter.' My skills on the ball are also very good. But of course, my great strength is making runs with the right timing.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing an instrumental role in Bayern's three-trophy season.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nManchester City missed out on the title to Liverpool last season by an 18-point margin, but De Bruyne's work did not go unnoticed. In 35 Premier League appearances, he set up 20 goals for his teammates, matching the record for assists in a single season held by Arsenal great Thierry Henry. He also scored 13 goals for Pep Guardiola's side as they ended the season in second place. De Bruyne won't want to come second again, meaning his motor and creativity will be pivotal to City wrestling the title back from Merseyside.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Matching the Premier League's single-season assist record.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nWING\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nWingers still have a role to play in the modern era. Their pace and persistence on the flanks give their teams another angle of attack; their ability to cut infield and shoot adds a dimension too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nVinicius still feels more like a bundle of raw attributes -- pace, trickery -- than a fully formed player. He frustrates as often as he thrills, a view shared by his own Real Madrid teammates at times, as evidenced by Karim Benzema blasting Vinicius to another player while the Brazilian watched back in October. But when Real Madrid need a goal or a different dimension in attack, they turn to Vinicius. Half the time, even he doesn't look as if he knows what's going to happen next, but maybe that's the point. In a modern game that is so often defined by rigid tactical discipline, his unpredictability can be priceless.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the opening goal against Barcelona in El Clasico in March, a match that saw the title race start to tip in Real Madrid's favour.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nHazard called 2019-20 \"the worst season of my career\" and it's hard to argue. He was out of shape on his arrival at Real Madrid, and an ankle fracture in November followed by another in February meant Hazard was essentially an irrelevance in their title win. At least the campaign's delayed conclusion allowed him to recover in time to make some unremarkable late appearances. Serious questions have been asked about the wisdom of Madrid investing so much -- reportedly up to \u20ac160m -- in Hazard in 2019, especially when he would have been available for free a year later. No one doubts his world-class talent, though, and we might still see a player who was once the Premier League's best repeat that form in a Real Madrid shirt.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A stunning long-range goal against Huesca in October 2020 suggested that better things could be just around the corner.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Argentina\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nSevilla transfer guru Monchi rarely gets a deal wrong, but the bargain \u20ac15m signing of Ocampos from Marseille must rank among his best acquisitions ever. At that point, the Argentinian looked like a solid professional, albeit performing below the potential he'd shown as a youngster at River Plate, with underwhelming spells in Ligue 1 and Serie A. At Sevilla, he has developed into the best winger, and one of the most effective players in any position, in La Liga. His boundless reserves of energy are a perfect fit for Julen Lopetegui's exhausting, all-action brand of football. One game summed up his season: Not only did Ocampos score in Sevilla's 1-0 win over Eibar in July but he also went in goal when keeper Tomas Vaclik got injured, even making a crucial save in the ninth minute of added time.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's tempting to say the Europa League win, but let's face it: the brilliant madness of stand-in keeper Ocampos saving from actual Eibar keeper Dmitrovic (yes, really) in the 99th minute is hard to beat.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere was a cruel poetry to the manner of Paris Saint-Germain's 2020 Champions League final defeat. Having spent over a billion euros to get within touching distance of the trophy they crave above all others, they were denied by a headed goal from Coman -- one of their own, discarded youth products. Coman joined PSG at the age of 10 and became their youngest-ever debutant at 16 before deciding to continue his career elsewhere. Still improving and into his sixth season at Bayern, he has an experience beyond his years and a trophy cabinet to match.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner in a Champions League final against his former club.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/United States\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPulisic's first season in England might have ended on a sour note, with him looking distraught as he limped off with a hamstring injury in Chelsea's FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal, but that shouldn't obscure what had come before it. Pulisic did enough that day at Wembley -- and in the 2019-20 season as a whole -- to suggest that all the hype around the U.S. star is absolutely justified. Nine Premier League goals from 25 appearances was an impressive return for a wide player, and more than twice as many as he ever scored in a season at Borussia Dortmund, which suggests he's progressing nicely under coach Frank Lampard despite those injury problems.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That fifth-minute FA Cup final goal.",

He broke the record of 7:23.81 set by Ethiopia's Lamecha Girma two years ago.\n\nFisher, the bronze medalist in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the Paris Olympics, needed a strong kick just to hold on for the win. Close behind him was Cole Hocker, who finished in 7:23.14 and also would have broken the world indoor mark. Hocker is the reigning Olympic 1,500-meter champion.\n\nSoon after, it was Nuguse's turn to chase history. He finished the Wanamaker Mile in a world-record time of 3:46.63. It eclipsed the time of 3:47.01 that Ethiopia's Yomif Kejelcha turned in nearly six years ago.\n\nLike Fisher, Nuguse, 25, needed an all-out burst toward the end. Hobbs Kessler was on his heels and finished in 3:46.90, which also would've broken the mark that Kejelcha held.\n\nBoth world records are subject to ratification.\n\nIn men's 60-meter race, Americans Marcellus Moore, Trayvon Bromell and Pjai Austin went 1-2-3.

The move gives NBC Sports, the Olympic rights holder that operates Peacock, a foothold in track and field after not renewing its deal to stream track's Diamond League meets after last year.\n\nThe CW's highest-profile sports deal, with LIV Golf, ended after two seasons of paltry ratings. The start-up golf series recently signed a deal with Fox Sports that goes into effect this year.\n\nThe CW also carries Atlantic Coast Conference football and basketball games, Pac-12 football and NASCAR's Xfinity Series.\n\nJohnson's mission is to keep track in front of fans for more than just the Olympic year and to set up more showdowns between the sport's top athletes.\n\nOther events this year are scheduled for Miami, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. The events will place runners in groups -- sprints, hurdles, middle distance, etc., -- and they will race twice over a weekend, with their placement in the races, not their times, determining the champions in each group.",

Officers had told Kerley to go around the area, but Kerley began to argue with them, which led to a shoving match with police.\n\nFour officers tried to take Kerley into custody while he moved to evade arrest, officials said. After being stunned with the Taser, Kerley was taken to a local hospital and then to the Miami-Dade County jail.\n\nKerley was charged with battery, resisting an officer and disorderly conduct.\n\nHe appeared at a bond hearing Friday at which defense attorney Yale Sanford was critical of the police officers at the scene.\n\n\"This seems like a total misunderstanding,\" Sanford said, according to WPLG TV, the ABC affiliate in Miami. \"Mr. Kerley is a record-breaking athlete. He has served in the Olympics for the United States track and field [team]. He is a model citizen in our community.

Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nUK Sport, the government body in charge of allocating spending to British sporting bodies, has said that UK Athletics will have its funding decreased as it re-allocates money to other sports.\n\nThe body will grant a record \u00a3330 million to Team GB for the LA 2028 Olympics and Paralympics -- the most ever for a four-year cycle -- but sees UK Athletics face an 8% decrease in its funding from \u00a322.2m to \u00a320.5m.\n\nCanoeing also saw a slight decrease, while rowing was granted the biggest increase, seeing it's funding grow from \u00a322.7m to \u00a324.9m.\n\n\"Following the spectacular performances of Team GB and ParalympicsGB in Paris this summer, it's so important for us to be able to keep the momentum going as we head into the LA cycle,\" Dr Kate Baker, director of performance at UK Sport said. \"This is our greatest investment to date, with more sports set to embark on an Olympic and Paralympic campaign with us than ever before.\"\n\nTeam GB won 10 medals in track and field during Paris 2024, including a gold for Keely Hodgkinson in the women's 800-metres. The body also said it will support four new sports: flag football, lacrosse, para climbing and squash, as well as baseball/softball, which had some funding during the previous cycle.\n\n\"With every Games cycle comes new sports and athletes with new stories to tell and inspiration to share,\" Baker added. \"With our investment supporting more breadth than ever before, as well as the entertainment, drama and spectacle we'll no doubt experience from a Games taking place in LA, I can't wait to see what our athletes can achieve in four years' time.\"",
