                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story contains profane and hateful language.\n\nAuthorities in at least three states have arrested individuals allegedly impersonating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at a time when real ICE agents have ramped up immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration, adding to existing fears of law enforcement among migrant communities.\n\nIn South Carolina, Sean-Michael Johnson, 33, was charged with kidnapping and impersonating a police officer after allegedly detaining a group of Latino men along a Charleston County road. Johnson is accused of \u201cwillfully and unlawfully presenting himself as an ICE Agent and detaining a vehicle of individuals from moving,\u201d according to court records.\n\nThe incident, which was recorded by one of the victims, took place on Sullivan\u2019s Island near Charleston on January 29.\n\n\u201cYou all got caught!\u201d Johnson is heard saying on the video. \u201cWhere are you from, Mexico? You from Mexico? You\u2019re going back to Mexico!\u201d\n\nIn the video, Johnson is seen taking the driver\u2019s keys, mocking the driver\u2019s accent, while jiggling the car keys in his face. At one point he is seen trying to take the driver\u2019s phone.\n\nThe driver calls a friend and, speaking Spanish, says, \u201cI don\u2019t know man, he\u2019s saying immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow don\u2019t be speaking that pig-Latin in my f**king country!\u201d Johnson says, knocking the phone out of his hand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s a racist, man,\u201d one of the passengers in the vehicle, another victim, can be heard saying in Spanish.\n\nMan poses as fake immigration officer 01:37 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson was charged with three counts of kidnapping and one count each of impersonating a law enforcement officer, petty larceny, assault and battery, according to jail records.\n\nCNN has been unable to locate an attorney for Johnson. In court Saturday, the public defender said Johnson was extremely sorry for his actions.\n\nJohnson bonded out of jail over the weekend, and in a court appearance Saturday his family pleaded with the judge, saying that their son has mental health issues and \u201chas tried to get help\u201d in the past, \u201cbut he needs to continue with that therapy,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WCIV.\n\nCNN has reached out to ICE for comment.\n\n\u2018Vulnerable in this moment\u2019\n\nThe founder and president of the Charleston Hispanic Association told CNN that harassment of his constituents based on their ethnicity is commonplace.\n\n\u201cWe hear of Hispanics being targeted quite a bit. It\u2019s an everyday thing,\u201d Enrique Grace told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is an isolated case, it was just caught on video. It\u2019s pretty sad to see that.\u201d\n\nThe ICE impersonation cases come as President Donald Trump has quickly mobilized wide swaths of the federal government to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants in the United States, part of a broader strategy to amass a large enforcement machine.\n\nThe administration has sent troops to the US-Mexico border, utilized military aircraft to repatriate recent border crossers, and deployed people from multiple federal agencies, including those under the Justice Department, to augment immigration enforcement operations.\n\n\u201cImmigrants are a target for scams anyway, and I think that this just kind of amplifies this, this situation where people who are particularly vulnerable are in this moment where they are kind of looking for ICE agents everywhere,\u201d Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marin Baena told CNN.\n\nThe grassroots organization based out of North Carolina focuses on supporting Latino communities through civic engagement and social justice.\n\nSiembra NC is actively combating ICE impersonation and reducing community fear by creating and distributing multimedia educational resources, including graphics and videos, and hosting statewide \u201cknow your rights\u201d presentations that teach Latino residents how to distinguish between legitimate federal law enforcement officers and potential impersonators.\n\nCollege student accused of impersonation\n\nIn another impersonation case, in Philadelphia, police charged a Temple University student in connection with the alleged impersonation of ICE officers on campus. The incident, which occurred Saturday night, involved three individuals, two wearing shirts with \u201cPolice\u201d and \u201cICE\u201d in white lettering, attempting to enter a residence hall on campus, Temple University said in a statement.\n\nAfter being denied entrance to the residence hall, they were later found disrupting a local business, the university said.\n\nPhiladelphia police arrested 22-year-old Aidan Steigelmann, charging him with impersonating a public servant, with the university saying that he\u2019s been placed on \u201cinterim suspension.\u201d Two other suspects involved in the incident fled the scene in a light-colored SUV, according to the Philadelphia Police Department.\n\nCNN has reached out to Steigelmann\u2019s attorney for comment.\n\nTemple\u2019s statement followed an announcement earlier in the week reacting to Trump\u2019s executive orders, including the plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty of the present moment has also led to an increase in rumors, which can quickly be amplified through social media,\u201d Temple University President John Fry said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cPlease know that neither Temple\u2019s Department of Public Safety nor the Philadelphia Police Department have any reports of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents being on campus.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in Raleigh, North Carolina, Carl Thomas Bennett was arrested for allegedly impersonating an ICE officer and sexual assaulting a woman at a Motel 6 threatening to deport her if she didn\u2019t comply, according to CNN affiliate WRAL.\n\nPolice reports indicated that Bennett, 37, \u201cthreatened to deport the victim if she did not have sex with him,\u201d and \u201cdisplayed a business card with a badge on it,\u201d according to WRAL.\n\nBennett was denied bond and appointed a public defender, court records show, CNN affiliate WBTV reported.\n\nCNN has reached out to Raleigh Police Department for comment.\n\nThe incidents show the importance of \u201csafe space\u201d policies, according to Maribel Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera, director of policy and government affairs, border and immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for immigrant communities to feel safe, to be able to approach law enforcement and report anything that\u2019s happening and when people do not feel safe, not only does it make people who are immigrants less safe, but it makes all of us less safe,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera said.\n\nIn her view, Trump administration immigration policies are designed to instill fear, which she says endangers public safety for entire communities.\n\n\u201cThe point of their policies is to create fear, to create panic, to create chaos. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera told CNN. \u201cThe point is a cruelty and that is what\u2019s being exploited here.\u201d\n\nUnder the Trump administration, federal immigration authorities are now permitted to arrest people and carry out enforcement actions in and near places such as churches and schools, marking a departure from long-standing policy to avoid so-called sensitive areas. Hernandez said the shift in policy not only threatens public safety but discourages people who need help from law enforcement or health care providers to seek it out.\n\nAfter watching the video Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera said it also showed the effect that White House policies are having across the country \u2013 not just for migrant communities but also everyone else.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is we have leadership at the top that dehumanizes people who are immigrants and now this is the outcome of that dehumanizing,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera said. \u201cYou end up having a violation of people\u2019s rights, people see and hear this and they feel emboldened to go against immigrants.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Devon Sayers, Shawn Nottingham, Nayeli Jaramillo-Plata, and Lex Harvey contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA Philadelphia father is calling his son a \u201csuperhero\u201d for shielding his younger sister when a medevac jet crashed in a Philadelphia neighborhood, showering flames and debris on homes and the vehicle in which the family was riding. The boy suffered a serious head wound and is recovering.\n\nAndre Howard Jr. picked up his three children from school last Friday and took them to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for an evening snack. The weekly family ritual was upended when the plane crashed nearby, killing all six on board, including a mother and daughter returning to Mexico from medical treatment. A person on the ground was killed and more than two dozen others were injured.\n\n\u201cA really loud boom, and we saw a fireball that covered the whole entire sky,\u201d Howard told CNN on Monday.\n\nHoward said he put his truck in reverse to avoid the debris and could see cars engulfed in flames, a man on fire and people flying through the air.\n\nAmid the chaos and panic, Howard said he heard his 10-year-old son Andre III tell his 4-year-old sister, Ayura, to get down, then dove on top of her to shield the girl from the flying debris.\n\nAndre Howard III was protecting his sister, Ayura. Courtesy Andre Howard\n\nWhen he checked the back seat, Howard said, he saw his daughter and another son, 7, were OK, but Andre had a piece of metal lodged in the right side of his head.\n\n\u201cI see my unconscious son with a piece of metal in his head. I got out of the truck and put a sock on his head, and as I moved him, the metal piece fell, and he was gushing out blood,\u201d Howard told CNN while fighting back tears.\n\nA man came over and gave him his shirt to help stanch bleeding, Howard said. A woman looked after the other children while Howard tended to Andre.\n\nHoward said the medical team at the hospital explained there was a possibility Andre would never be able to walk again, and his vision could be impaired. \u201cThey gave us the roundup of everything that could happen,\u201d Howard said.\n\nFollowing surgery and a CAT scan, Andre III was transferred to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia in stable condition. Since then, he\u2019s been making progress. He\u2019s expected to walk and his vision is fine, his father said.\n\nHoward said that when Andre awoke the first thing he did was ask about Ayura. \u201cDid I save her from the crash?\u201d the boy asked.\n\n\u201cAndre is my superhero,\u201d Howard said. \u201cAs a dad, I\u2019ve always instilled in them [his two sons] to protect your sister when daddy is not around. And I\u2019m grateful to have a son like Andre.\u201d\n\nTwo dozen were injured on the ground, and at least one died\n\nAll six people aboard the twin-engine medevac were killed when it crashed, along with one person in a car on the ground. At least 24 people on the ground were injured, and four remain hospitalized, Mayor Cherelle Parker said Monday.\n\nLocal and state officials continued to caution they are not ready to say the death toll will remain at seven.\n\nWhile highlighting the cooperative efforts among government agencies, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro noted Monday there are people \u201cright now who are going through DNA,\u201d in addition to others who have been combing the scene for more evidence.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has finished their on-site investigation, and crews will work through the night to clean up the areas impacted by the crash, Philadelphia Managing Director Adam K. Thiel said during an update Tuesday.\n\nOfficials have emphasized for days if there are people local residents fear are missing and may have been in the area, they should get in touch with police as soon as possible.\n\nSix who died on plane included a child\n\nThe six onboard were Mexican nationals, including a child who had been treated for an illness at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia and her mother, officials said. They were returning home to Mexico after the girl\u2019s treatment, with the flight\u2019s final destination set for Tijuana.\n\nLizeth Murillo Osuna (right) and Valentina Guzm\u00e1n Murillo, the mother and child who died in the Philadelphia plane crash. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe mayor of Ensenada, in the Mexican state of Baja California, identified Lizeth Murillo Osuna and her daughter, Valentina Guzm\u00e1n Murillo, as two of the victims.\n\n\u201cMy sincere condolences and wishes of a prompt resignation to their families and loved ones,\u201d Mayor Claudia Agat\u00f3n Mu\u00f1iz said. She didn\u2019t provide the ages of those killed.\n\nHours before the crash, staff at the hospital held a sendoff gathering for the pediatric patient\u2019s flight home.\n\nCaregivers, staff and patients joined together to \u201cwish her well on her journey and to punctuate her time at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia as meaningful and impactful,\u201d chief marketing and communications officer Mel Bower told CNN.\n\nThe young girl formed close bonds with other patients, and all the staff that knew her, Bower said. \u201cShe will be remembered for her sweet spirit, and we will take that spirit with us as we go forward.\u201d\n\nValentina was receiving treatment for a spinal condition, said Susan Marie Fasino, the founder of the organization His Wings Ranch, which was helping the family access treatment.\n\nThe young girl was receiving care for a pressure sore related to her spina bifida condition, Fasino said, adding that she had faced numerous health challenges and was very frail.\n\nFasino remembered Osuna as \u201cthe most adoring, attentive mother a child could ever have.\u201d She emphasized how the mom \u201cliterally never left her side.\u201d\n\nShe described their deaths as an an \u201cextremely painful and devastating time for all of us.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the victims when contacted by CNN.\n\nCaptain Alan Montoya Perales, 46, left, and Co-pilot Josue de Jesus Juarez, 43. Jet Rescue Air Ambulance\n\nThe four crew members killed in the crash were identified by the flight operator on Sunday.\n\nThe aircraft had been piloted by Capt. Alan Montoya Perales, 46, and co-pilot Josue de Jesus Juarez, 43, a spokesperson for Jet Rescue Air Ambulance told CNN.\n\nThey were accompanied by Dr. Raul Meza Arredondo and paramedic Rodrigo Lopez Padilla, both 41, the spokesperson said.\n\nDr. Raul Meza Arredondo, 41 Jet Rescue Air Ambulance\n\nParamedic Rodrigo Lopez Padilla, 41 Jet Rescue Air Ambulance\n\nInvestigators looking for answers\n\nThe Learjet 55 had just taken off and was in flight for less than a minute when it crashed into a residential neighborhood, authorities said, engulfing five homes and multiple vehicles in flames and covering the area with debris.\n\nPhotos and videos from the crash show houses with burning roofs and smoke billowing out. Some businesses were also damaged. The next day, the area was cordoned off, with blackened cars left on the road.\n\nThe flight crew was extremely experienced and the aircraft was well-maintained, Shai Gold, a spokesperson for the flight operator Jet Rescue Air Ambulance told CNN on Saturday, adding the company was cooperating with authorities.\n\nNTSB investigators have recovered the aircraft\u2019s cockpit voice recorder (CVR) \u2013 also referred to as a \u2018black box\u2019 the agency said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe CVR was located at the site of initial impact, at a depth of 8 feet. NTSB investigators also recovered the airplane\u2019s enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS), which could also contain flight data,\u201d it said.\n\nThe systems will now be evaluated, the NTSB said. Investigators have also recovered both engines, spoken to witnesses and obtained surveillance videos, it said.\n\nInvestigators have been collecting debris from the crash site, which spans four to six blocks, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a data recorder on this aircraft, but there is an enhanced ground proximity warning system. Information can come off that device, whether it\u2019s the speed or location of the aircraft, we will be able to get some data, hopefully off that device,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a news conference with local officials Monday.\n\nDuffy took a moment to praise local leaders for their response thus far, specifically the mayor and Shapiro. \u201cI saw what she was doing through this crisis, and the kind of leadership that she has offered in Philadelphia has been remarkable,\u201d Duffy said.\n\nShapiro praised the unified response of local, state and federal officials over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe saw neighbor helping neighbor,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWe know that there will be loss in this region and we want to offer our thoughts and our serious prayers for those who are grieving.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

Now, their attention turns to clearing the remaining wreckage.\n\nThe Bombardier CRJ700 jet operating as American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission ran into each other over the river nearly a week ago in an accident that remains unexplained.\n\nMore parts of the plane \u2013 which will also form pieces of the puzzle investigators are trying to solve \u2013 were pulled from the river Tuesday morning. One section of the plane\u2019s fuselage lay sideways on a barge, a row of cabin windows clearly visible. By afternoon, the plane\u2019s tail \u2013 with its distinctive red, white and blue livery \u2013 was removed from the murky water.\n\nOfficials have said they would likely recover the American Airlines cockpit later Tuesday, wind gusts and tidal levels permitting. As of Tuesday, 66 of the 67 victims recovered have been identified.\n\nFor the second day in a row Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board \u2013 which has been reviewing data from the Black Hawk\u2019s flight data recorder that was recovered over the weekend \u2013 backed away from announced plans for a public briefing on its investigation.\n\n\u201cNTSB needs additional information to verify data points from the Black Hawk,\u201d the agency said in a post on X, adding that a written update would be released later in the day.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke to American Airlines CEO Robert Isom by phone Monday, a source familiar with the call told CNN. The White House did not comment Tuesday on what was discussed.\n\nCNN obtained a memo from Isom to employees confirming the call with Trump. In it, Isom says the president called to \u201cshare his condolences for our crew members, passengers and their loved ones.\u201d The note also says he asked Isom to relay his \u201cpersonal appreciation\u201d for the work of airline employees supporting the families.\n\nThe airline will observe a moment of silence Wednesday to mark one week since the fatal collision, according to the note from Isom.\n\nAs a salvage team continues to work in cold winter conditions to lift debris from the frigid water, key questions about the cause of the fatal collision remain \u2013\u2013 though answers may not be immediately clear for weeks.\n\nThe former director of the FAA\u2019s Office of Accident Investigation, Steven Wallace, said he\u2019s confident the cause of the disaster will eventually be unambiguous.\n\n\u201cWe have radar data, we have eyewitnesses, and we have all the wreckage,\u201d Wallace told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing missing.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday, inclement weather will bear down on Washington, with snow, sleet and freezing rain expected to worsen already tough conditions for recovery personnel.\n\nA crane retrieves the tail of the American Airlines jet from the Potomac River on Tuesday. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nAn arduous and slow recovery mission\n\nThe mangled wreckage in the Potomac has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane\u2019s fuselage.\n\nDivers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal, but heavier salvage equipment is required to get jet parts out of the way and out of the water.\n\nThe recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including those from the US Coast Guard, the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.\n\nA new phase of recovery began Monday after divers spent the weekend getting a view of the underwater debris to map out a plan to recover the jet wreckage.\n\nThe NTSB on Monday said the agency is working to get the airplane out first, before the helicopter, a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, which will take four days longer.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s work was painstaking and slow.\n\nA jet engine was the first to be lifted from the frigid water, slowly raised by a crane. Video taken from shore showed salvage workers guiding it gently to the deck of a barge. From a distance, most of the engine\u2019s cowling and exhaust nozzle appeared intact.\n\nTwo hours later, a second piece of the plane was pulled out \u2013\u2013 a jagged portion of the fuselage not immediately identifiable.\n\nDean Naujoks, the Potomac Riverkeeper for the past 10 years, was granted access to the site of the crash to help investigators search for debris, according to CNN affiliate WRAL.\n\nNaujoks recovered a window panel, a seat, insulation, an airplane manual and a bag of sugar packets. Everything was covered in jet fuel, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was just the saddest day I\u2019ve ever been on the river,\u201d Naujoks told WRAL. \u201cMy heart goes out to all the families of the victims.\u201d\n\nCrews pull up a part of the plane from the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Monday in Arlington, Virginia. Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nAirplane flight data recorder and helicopter black box reveal new clues\n\nThe American Airlines flight data recorder shows the plane\u2019s nose came up just before the fatal collision, an analysis by the NTSB found.\n\n\u201cAt one point very close to the impact, there was a slight change in pitch, an increase in pitch,\u201d NTSB member Todd Inman said at a Saturday evening news conference.\n\nThe airplane\u2019s flight data recorder gives an altitude reading of about 325 feet at the time of impact, Inman said, but air traffic controllers never had an indication the helicopter went above 200 feet.\n\nA key question in the investigation has been focused on whether the Black Hawk helicopter was higher than the 200-foot altitude limit it was supposed to observe as it flew a designed route along the eastern bank of the Potomac.\n\nThe NTSB released early findings from the probe Tuesday that say radar displays in the airport\u2019s control tower showed the helicopter at 300 feet before the collision. The radar altitude data is rounded to the nearest hundred feet, the NTSB said in a written investigative update.\n\nThe helicopter corridor in use at the time carried an altitude restriction of 200 feet, the NTSB said. The update is more in line with data from one of the airline\u2019s so-called black boxes.\n\nThe NTSB said it pulled the Potomac TRACON \u2013 or terminal radar approach control \u2013 data to help resolve a discrepancy in the initial readings from the radar data gathered for the investigation.\n\nThat discrepancy, according to Jennifer Homendy, chair of the NTSB, could be because the radar at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is updated every five seconds, allowing for significant movements within that frame.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that occurs in five seconds, especially when a helicopter is moving at a pretty good clip,\u201d she said Monday after they recovered the helicopter\u2019s black box.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking that data and making sure that it\u2019s accurate, that the time stamps are right to try to marry it up with the (black box) data from the plane in order to provide that information publicly,\u201d she said.\n\nLater Monday, the NTSB said the flight data recorder for the Black Hawk did not have timestamps and investigators would have to manually create them. A preliminary report from the NTSB will likely be published in a month.",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nThe founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group was convicted Monday of conspiring with his former girlfriend to plan an attack on Maryland\u2019s power grid in furtherance of their shared racist beliefs.\n\nBrandon Russell, 29, encouraged Sarah Beth Clendaniel to carry out a series of \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore that could have caused significant damage to the regional power grid, according to federal prosecutors. Their goal was to create chaos in the majority-Black city, prosecutors say.\n\nThe two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before the plans were executed.\n\nThe 12-person jury deliberated for less than an hour after hearing about four days of testimony in federal court in Baltimore. They found Russell guilty of one count of conspiracy to damage an energy facility, the only charge he faced.\n\nRussell will be sentenced at a later date. He appeared in court wearing a light blue jacket and glasses. He conferred regularly with his attorney throughout the trial, looking cheerful and engaged.\n\nSeveral years ago, Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t his first run-in with law enforcement. Russell previously pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials after investigators searched his home and found a stash of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books and flags.\n\nDuring closing arguments Monday afternoon, prosecutor Joseph Baldwin recounted trial testimony, including from a confidential informant who got connected with Russell through the social media app Telegram. Russell introduced Clendaniel and the informant, hoping the person could help her obtain a firearm to use in the attack, according to prosecutors.\n\n\u201cHe was the team leader taking care of his warrior,\u201d Baldwin told the jury.\n\nSarah Beth Clendaniel, Brandon Russell's former girlfriend, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison. Amy Davis/The Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nProsecutors played a clip from a recorded phone call in which Russell used a racist expletive and requested secrecy from the informant, telling him: \u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t talk about this to anyone.\u201d\n\nWhile prosecutors claimed Russell hoped to incite a race war, his defense attorney downplayed his involvement in the plot, calling the case \u201ca setup from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nRussell was in Florida the entire time with no plans to travel to Maryland and actively assist in carrying out the attack, attorney Ian Goldstein said. Russell may have supported efforts to disrupt modern society and restore White supremacy, but he wasn\u2019t a co-conspirator in this case, Goldstein said during his closing argument.\n\n\u201cHe was a cheerleader \u2014 as terrible as that sounds,\u201d Goldstein said, acknowledging his client\u2019s \u201crepulsive\u201d ideology. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was, and that\u2019s not illegal.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough to convince the jury. Before jurors began deliberating Monday evening, US District Judge James Bredar told them a guilty verdict would require a finding that Russell had \u201cengaged, advised or assisted\u201d in the conspiracy with knowledge of its objectives.\n\nRussell apparently wasn\u2019t on law enforcement\u2019s radar until police responded to a 2017 double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found him outside crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the other two, officials said.\n\nPolice concluded Russell had nothing to do with the deadly shootings. But while detectives investigated, they discovered the explosive materials and neo-Nazi paraphernalia in Russell\u2019s possession, including flyers that said, \u201cDon\u2019t prepare for exams, prepare for a race war\u201d and a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.\n\nRussell was in the Florida National Guard at the time and had attended the University of South Florida.\n\nDevon Arthurs, who later pleaded guilty to killing his roommates, told detectives he shot them for teasing him about his recent conversion to Islam. He also said it was to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen and claimed Russell had materials in the house \u201cto kill civilians and target locations like power lines, nuclear reactors, and synagogues,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nGoldstein also represented Russell in that case, when the attorney argued that possessing explosives didn\u2019t mean Russell intended to use them to cause harm. Goldstein said his client was traumatized by the deaths of his roommates and already suffered from mental health issues. Family members said Russell was just a follower looking for community and trying to please his friends.\n\nRussell ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials. He was sentenced in 2018 to serve five years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, a federal judge in Tampa expressed explicit concern that Russell could fall in with the wrong crowd behind bars.\n\nSeveral years later, federal investigators discovered his relationship with Clendaniel, who similarly had a long history of White supremacist beliefs.\n\nShe and Russell began exchanging letters around 2018 while they were incarcerated in different facilities. They developed a romantic relationship that continued after they were released from prison, court records show.\n\nClendaniel, 36, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison.",

Trade war\n\nChina slapped retaliatory tariffs on some American imports today, not long after President Donald Trump\u2019s 10% tariffs on Chinese goods took effect. China has also levied a 10% tariff affecting US crude oil, agricultural machinery, and certain cars and pickup trucks. Some types of American coal and natural gas will face a 15% tax. The measures will roll out on February 10. This comes after Trump said on Monday he agreed to \u201cimmediately pause\u201d tariffs on Mexico and Canada after speaking with those countries\u2019 leaders. He had previously warned that 25% tariffs on goods made in the two countries would come into force today at midnight.\n\n2. Deportation deal\n\nEl Salvador has offered to house violent US criminals and deportees of any nationality in an unprecedented deal. The controversial agreement was unveiled Monday by Secretary of State Marco Rubio after meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. \u201c[Bukele] has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those of US citizenship and legal residents,\u201d Rubio said, alarming critics and rights groups. Any effort by the Trump administration to deport incarcerated US nationals to another country would likely face significant legal pushback.\n\n3. US-Israel relations\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting Washington today, where he will become the first foreign leader to have a formal meeting with President Trump at the White House. US and Israeli officials say the two will hold a joint news conference after their talks. The meeting will take place against the backdrop of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement \u2014 and as uncertainties remain about the technical details of the second phase of the deal. The ceasefire, in place for about two weeks, is set to expire on March 1.\n\n4. Wasted water\n\nAbout 2.2 billion gallons of water flowed out of reservoirs in Central California on Friday after President Donald Trump ordered the release with the misguided intent to send water to fire-ravaged Southern California. Trump celebrated the move in posts to Truth Social, declaring, \u201cthe water is flowing in California,\u201d and adding the water was \u201cheading to farmers throughout the State, and to Los Angeles.\u201d However, Los Angeles\u2019 water sources are completely separated from the reservoirs that were tapped. This means that instead of saving the water for the upcoming dry summer months, experts say it was wasted by being released during the wet winter season.\n\n5. TikTok ban\n\nTikTok is under pressure to find a new owner by April after President Trump signed a 75-day extension to the law that requires the app to be sold off from its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned in the US. Trump said Monday that TikTok could be acquired by a newly proposed US sovereign wealth fund to ensure the app remains accessible to its 170 million American users. But standing up a sovereign wealth fund and then using that fund to acquire the platform is unlikely to happen anytime soon, analysts say. It\u2019s also not clear who would run the fund or whether it could gather the tens of billions of dollars estimated to be needed to buy the platform.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nPhoto gallery: Kumbh Mela, the world\u2019s largest religious festival\n\nThe world\u2019s largest religious festival is in full swing, with millions of Hindu devotees making the pilgrimage to a holy city in northern India to bathe in its sacred waters.

A police report states that the parent told officers that a woman showed up to a Midwest City home on Jan. 30 saying she worked for DHS and presented an emergency custody form to take custody of her daughter. The woman told the parent that she would call police to take the child away if she did not hand over her daughter, according to the police report. The parent reluctantly gave the suspect the child \"based off believing the documents were official and under the guise she was immediately taking her to her cousin in Shawnee who is a foster approved DHS parent.\" The police report states that the document the suspect provided had stamps from the Oklahoma County Clerk with a judge's signature.

(KABC) -- For families impacted by wildfires, the idea of rebuilding their home can be daunting. Not only is there confusion about how to start, but there's the natural fear that another fire could burn down their home again.\n\nRyan and Ann Palos know what it's like to recover from a wildfire.\n\nTheir home in Santa Clarita was destroyed by the Tick Fire in 2019, and the recent firestorm across Southern California brought back horrible memories.\n\nRyan said he still remembers his daughters' voices telling him to leave their home when the fire broke out, but he wanted to make sure his neighbors made it out safely.\n\n\"You just remember the moments before you leave and the moments when you realize you don't have anything left,\" Ann said.\n\nWe met the Palos family in 2021 as they began to rebuild using what's called ICF, or Insulating Concrete Forms - a home designed and permitted as non-combustible and built using only foam, concrete and rebar.\n\nThey hope their home can serve as a model to the thousands of people about to undertake a similar journey.\n\n\"You have to build smarter nowadays. We're in an area where every other week there's a fire...and there are certain times a year in Santa Clarita where we have fires... Everybody just knows, we have fires. You have to build smarter. We have to push for people to build smarter,\" Ann added.\n\nICF builds are common, but the Palos family used PHNX Development and their unique longspan system to eliminate the need for any wood in the structure.\n\n\"With us, it takes one day to frame a roof and one day to roof it. And our roof has no penetrations, we have no roof vents, so the only penetrations we're going to have are plumbing vents, and we keep those to a minimum,\" said Laurie Fisher, the company's founder.\n\nAs people plan to rebuild after the destructive Los Angeles wildfires, we've received a lot of questions about how to find the right contractor.\n\nRyan said their home now has so much flexibility.\n\n\"Since there's no load-bearing walls here in the house, we can reconfigure the rooms in the future, whichever way we want to,\" he added.\n\nTheir home is not made with any wood. Even the roof is non-combustible material.\n\n\"It's so hard to get wood out of residential construction and it's mainly the roof sheathing - the plywood sheathing in the roof. That's the toughest part and that's what our patent-pending longspan system does, is it eliminates the need for sheathing,\" Fisher said.\n\nIn spite of the reduced fire risk to the home, it was still a challenge to get fire insurance.\n\nThe family was rejected by several companies, but eventually, executives from Mercury Insurance visited the home and not only offered coverage, but at a lower rate than prior to the fire.\n\n\"When they toured it, they kind of had a surprised look... 'Oh, it's like a traditional house',\" said Ryan. \"You wouldn't know this type of construction was possible but when they saw it, it opened their eyes.\"\n\nMercury now has an alliance with PHNX Development to make homes in high fire-risk areas insurable, and said in a statement:\n\n\"We want to continue to grow our homeowners book in California, but we also want to help the industry rethink the way we approach catastrophe-prone areas so we can all insure more homes,\" said President and Chief Operating Officer Victor Joseph.\n\n\"I think, for me, it's just peace of mind. Wanting to make sure that our family is in a safer position should something come back next time,\" Ann said.\n\nIf ICF is of interest to you, remember to use someone familiar with the type of construction and tour previous builds they've had.\n\nAnd as with the thousands of new homes coming over the next decade, do your homework when hiring someone to rebuild.",

                "text": "In a circle of chairs filled with young people, many who have had contact with the justice system, two men whose lives were intertwined at the worst moment sit and tell their story. Jason Kasperek is a crime victim but says transparency of his own past led him to forgiveness of the two men sent to prison for 98 years each for a violent 1998 armed robbery at the Blockbuster store where Kasperek was a young manager.\n\nJason Kasperek and Michael Clifton speak to a group as part of their restorative justice journey. CBS\n\nMichael Clifton spent 24-and-a-half years in prison, but now released with the support of Kasperek, joined him Monday evening to talk to a room full of young people who've had contact with the juvenile justice system, family, friends, and other restorative justice advocates.\n\n\"I didn't fully understand or grasp not just the victim of the crime on Jason. But to his family, to my family, and to the community,\" Michael Clifton told the gathering.\n\nClifton now works with a nonprofit called Remerg, helping ex-convicts return to society without recidivism.\n\n\"He's my brother from another mother and you know he calls my mom. He reaches out to her all the time. We try to get together at least once a month,\" explained Clifton later.\n\n\"That's why me and Michael do this now,\" said Jason Kasperek. \"Let people see the forgiveness. The youth doesn't understand it anymore. They see it as a weakness\u2026 As far as forgiveness, it has pretty much become extinct inside of the United States.\"\n\nKasperek found out the other man convicted in the crime, Rene Lima-Marin was released 90 years early on his 98-year sentence years after the release. There had been a paperwork error, the state said. Lima-Marin had gotten out and led a law-abiding life with a new wife when the mistake was discovered and he was taken back into custody six years later.\n\nRene Lima-Marin and Jason Kasperek in 2018 CBS\n\nLima-Marin wanted to apologize to Kasperek in person. Kasperek was still suffering nightmares, but in 2018, he agreed to the meeting, an idea generated by CBS Colorado reporter Rick Sallinger. After an emotional session, he accepted the apology and turned to the process of restorative justice and forgiveness.\n\n\"The one person that helped me see that, that brought me into this was Rick Sallinger,\" he said about Sallinger's facilitating of the meeting and helping him with the realization.\n\nClifton however, remained in prison and began to seek clemency. Kasperek met with him and separately, his family, telling them he would do what he could to support it. The governor's office contacted Kasperek before releasing him in 2023 after 24-plus years.\n\nA thankful and tearful Clifton said he would live a changed life. By all indications, that is what he has done.\n\n\"I'm learning. It's a completely new world, but I'm definitely excited for my life and where I'm at right now. And the things that I'm doing,\" he said Monday. He learned during the time he spent in prison, of the hurt Jason Kasperek still suffered during court hearings about Lima-Marin.\n\n\"That pain was still there. That was so hard for me I was sitting in a cell watching it and I broke down.\"\n\nNow they impart their stories together, as close friends.\n\n\"It is about us doing something together. Because there's meaning to our story. There's purpose in my life in what I do now, but there's purpose in us sharing our story together. Definitely, we want to have an impact on the youth.\"\n\nJason Kasperek and Michael Clifton. CBS\n\nKasperek talks of his own realizations over the stiff penalties Clifton and Lima-Marin were given, which he initially backed.\n\n\"You have to be transparent with yourself about who you are, and what has happened, he said, explaining that he'd been forgiven through the years by family and friends for transgressions that were certainly far less severe than armed robbery, but still part of his life. \"Forgiveness then turns into hope for the both of you,\" he explained, \"Because forgiveness sets you free, just as much as it does the other person.\"\n\nAnd the recurring nightmares- are gone.\n\n\"After I met with Rene and after I met with Michael, it just kind of all washed away. And it freed me from my life term. After I helped them free Michael from his life sentence.\"",

The area has been designated as a temporary processing site for toxic household waste such as paint, propane tanks and lithium-ion batteries from Altadena.\n\n\"You're moving this toxic waste across cities and you're putting it in an area really close to a water source,\" Azusa resident Erik Armstrong said.\n\nContractors for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) remove household hazardous waste as they search through homes damaged and destroyed by the Eaton Fire in the Altadena neighborhood of Los Angeles county, California, on January 30, 2025. Fires erupted almost simultaneously in two separate neighborhoods of Los Angeles during a furious windstorm on January 7. Whole streets were engulfed as hurricane-force gusts flung fireballs from house to house. PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHowever, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson Harry Allen tried to soothe the community's fears by explaining the installed protective measures.\n\n\"At the floor, there's a thick plastic liner, and over the top of that, we have mats covering the whole area,\" he said. \"The stuff we bring in is in a double-lined plastic bag. We put it down on a covered table and sort it into lined boxes so the material never touches the ground.\"\n\nAllen added that this is the fastest his agency has been asked to clear debris from a wildfire. They had little time to secure a large enough available site.\n\n\"The pressures to repopulate the burned areas were very great from all levels of the federal government,\" he said.\n\nThe same conversation regarding the hazardous materials from the Palisades Fire happened during a city meeting in Malibu.\n\n\"The way that you figure out there's a health risk is when people start getting sick,\" one resident said during the meeting. \"Because there are so few of us here, we don't matter at all.\"\n\nWhile the EPA is set to use state land on Topanga Canyon Boulevard, they believe there is not enough room for the sheer amount of fire debris.\n\n\"We need over 20 acres of staging areas,\" FEMA Regional Director Michael Montgomery said. \"We need significantly more staging areas.\"\n\nThe EPA said most of the debris will be taken out of state for processing. However, other nearby locations will be evaluated as potential sites.",

Around 5:15 a.m., their car hit the median near New Plymouth (between Nampa and the Idaho-Oregon border) and rebounded back into traffic, according to an Idaho State Police news release.\n\nAs the girls were removing their seatbelts from the initial incident, Idaho State Police Trooper Jace Shirrmacher tells EastIdahoNews.com they were hit from behind by a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee.\n\nTabitha was ejected from the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI flew out the window and ended up breaking my neck in two places, (as well as) my collarbone, my chest plate and my ankle,\u201d Tabitha said.\n\nRELATED | Local woman among 3 hospitalized in 2-vehicle rollover crash\n\nThe spunky teenager spent her 19th birthday in Saint Alphonsus Hospital on Wednesday, where she has undergone four surgeries in the past week and is in constant pain.\n\nSurgeons have operated twice on her neck, as well as on her ankle and collarbone.\n\nCurrently, she can\u2019t even grasp a cup and will have to undergo intense physical therapy, occupational therapy and rehabilitation in the coming weeks and months to regain her mobility.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t move my arms above my shoulder height,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m non-weight bearing for the next six weeks on my entire right side.\u201d\n\nThe passenger was released last week from the hospital and is recovering.\n\nAdditionally, the driver of the Jeep left the hospital the day of the accident and is doing well, according to Shirrmacher.\n\nThe incident remains under investigation by Idaho State Police.\n\nTabitha works as a medical technician at a rehabilitation care center in Idaho Falls. Being a recipient of medical care has completely changed her perspective.\n\n\u201cI have a lot more sympathy for my patients now,\u201d Tabitha said. \u201cI already had sympathy for them. Now that I\u2019m on the receiving end of this, I feel bad. \u2026I\u2019m so independent, and I\u2019m so used to (caring) for other people.\u201d\n\nReturning to work is one of her top priorities, but she isn\u2019t sure if her body will be the same.\n\n\u201cMy hands are not going to go back to where they need to be. I need to be able to lift,\u201d Tabitha said.\n\nShe\u2019s grateful for the family who has visited her in the hospital. To others who are in pain or going through life-altering situations and difficulties, Tabitha offers some advice.\n\n\u201cTry and find (your) happy spot,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that reading has been a big escape for me in the hospital. It\u2019s hard, and it hurts, but you\u2019ll get through it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to assist Tabitha and provide hope during her long road to recovery, you can donate to a GoFundMe set up by her family.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRafael Fantauzzi has worked in diversity, equity and inclusion roles in the retail, home health and pharmaceutical industries for the last eight years.\n\nThe Philadelphia-area resident takes pride in helping improve the workplace culture and experience for women, people with disabilities, veterans and Black and brown people, he said.\n\nBut as Fantauzzi \u2014 who left his DEI chief job at a pharmaceutical company last month due to restructuring \u2014 searches for a new role in the field, those opportunities may be shrinking as President Donald Trump and his conservative allies wage war on DEI.\n\nAfter taking office last week, Trump ordered all federal DEI workers to be placed on paid leave and signed an executive order targeting private companies with DEI programs.\n\nThe directives came as several major corporations rolled back their DEI initiatives in response to conservative backlash and lawsuits from right-wing groups. On Friday, Target became the latest big company to reverse its DEI programs.\n\nThe shift in the industry, DEI consultants and analysts say, has left many professionals concerned about their job stability and the future of their careers in the field.\n\n\u201cThere is fear and the fear is real,\u201d Fantauzzi said. \u201cI think some of the fear is a lack of understanding. What are the repercussions?\u201d\n\nStill, Fantauzzi said he remains optimistic that when the dust settles, companies will reinvent DEI in a way that makes sense from a legal and financial standpoint.\n\nSeveral major companies contacted by CNN did not respond to requests for information about the status of their DEI programs. Other companies and DEI executives declined to comment.\n\nShaun Harper, founder of the Race & Equity Center at the University of Southern California, said he\u2019s spoken with DEI professionals who are anxious about the state of the industry and how the changes could impact their teams and the work they value.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid of losing their jobs, of losing their livelihoods, of not being able to get another job,\u201d Harper said. \u201cRight now the jobs that those folks have been doing for years are not en vogue.\u201d\n\nThere is also a sense of anger in the industry because DEI work is largely misunderstood by critics, Harper said.\n\nExperts say DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings.\n\n\u201cThey (DEI professionals) are so incredibly frustrated that they are being lied on and misrepresented as too woke, divisive people who hate America,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not who those folks are.\u201d\n\nHow reversing DEI hurts the workplace\n\nThe reversal of DEI programs could undo the progress made over the past decade to make workplaces more inclusive and supportive of employees from underserved groups, some experts say.\n\nNaomi Wheeless, chief customer officer at Nextech and an advocate for diversity, said DEI initiatives have helped elevate women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people to leadership roles at companies.\n\nNow, Wheeless worries some companies may be reluctant to hire too many non-White people because of how it might be perceived.\n\n\u201cSubconsciously, hiring decisions could start to sway, promotional decisions could start to sway in such a way that it becomes harder for these groups to get ahead,\u201d Wheeless said.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered in silence for so long, then we worked very hard to try to level the playing field,\u201d she added. \u201cWe begin to see the fruits of that labor and now the rug is being snatched from under our feet.\u201d\n\nFantauzzi said he expects some people from underrepresented communities to leave the federal government or corporations that drop DEI because they don\u2019t feel valued.\n\nThe result is a loss of talent that, in some cases, might be hard to replace, he said.\n\nHarper said the dismantling of DEI offices may lead to more harassment and discrimination lawsuits against companies because the policies and people that hold employees accountable won\u2019t be there. In many cases, DEI offices are charged with training workers on preventing unconscious bias, discrimination, inequities and sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cExisting inequities are going to widen, they are going to worsen as a result of this,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWomen are going to be disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nSome companies remain committed\n\nBut despite concern among DEI professionals, some remain optimistic there is still a future for DEI.\n\nCompanies such as Costco, Apple, E.l.f. Beauty and JPMorgan have publicly reaffirmed their commitments to DEI in recent weeks.\n\nA spokesperson for Mercedes-Benz USA said in an email to CNN the company remains \u201ccommitted to fostering an inclusive and equitable environment.\u201d\n\nThe NFL is also still committed to DEI, Commissioner Roger Goodell said during a news conference last month.\n\nGoodell said the league\u2019s rules and policies are \u201cdesigned around how do we increase the number of people that have an opportunity to have a career in the NFL, including people of color and women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get into this because it was a trend and we\u2019re not getting out of it because it\u2019s a trend,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe\u2019re in it because it makes the NFL better.\u201d\n\nDavid Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at New York University School of Law, said he believes there will continue to be a mixture of companies withdrawing from DEI and those continuing their programs.\n\nGlasgow said he encourages professionals to stay committed to the cause because DEI itself is not going away.\n\n\u201cNo matter what happens to the field of DEI as it is presently constituted and branded, the underlying work will endure,\u201d Glasgow said. \u201cWhat we are all trying to work on together is how do we live together in a multiracial democracy and create institutions of opportunity and fairness where people show up to work each day and feel that they have a fair shot at being hired or promoted. There are too many people in this country that care about these issues for that project to go away.\u201d",

                "text": "Columbus, Ohio AP \u2014\n\nA former deep-sea treasure hunter who has served nearly a decade in jail for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of missing gold coins has had that term ended by a federal judge in Ohio, but he will remain behind bars for now.\n\nU.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley agreed Friday to end Tommy Thompson\u2019s sentence on the civil contempt charge, saying he \u201cno longer is convinced that further incarceration is likely to coerce compliance.\u201d However, he also ordered that the research scientist immediately start serving a two-year sentence he received for a related criminal contempt charge, a term that was delayed when the civil contempt term was imposed.\n\nThompson has been held in contempt of court since December 15, 2015, and also incurred a daily fine of $1,000. In his ruling, Marbley assessed Thompson\u2019s total civil contempt fine at $3,335,000.\n\nThompson\u2019s case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic.\n\nDespite an investor lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson still won\u2019t cooperate with authorities trying to find 500 coins minted from some of the gold, according to court records. He has previously said, without providing details, that the coins \u2014 valued at about $2.5 million \u2014 were turned over to a trust in Belize.\n\nAfter Thompson failed to appear for a 2012 Ohio hearing to discuss the coins, U.S. marshals eventually tracked him to Florida in 2015 and arrested him. He pleaded guilty in April 2015 to skipping that hearing and was given the two-year prison sentence.\n\nFederal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson\u2019s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violated conditions of a plea agreement.",

Here are some of the victims of the tragedy identified so far.\n\nA Virginia family of four\n\nDonna Livingston took photos of her family aboard the plane before taking off from Wichita. CNN has blurred the passengers pictured in the background to protect their identities. courtesy Jin Ah Longerbeam\n\nIt was rare to walk into the Ashburn Ice House, in Northern Virginia, and not see a member of the Livingston family.\n\nEverly Livingston, 14, and her sister Alydia, 11, were promising young figure skaters, dad Peter Livingston played hockey and Donna was very active in the girls\u2019 lives, family friend Kim Urban told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper.\n\nThe family died in Wednesday night\u2019s crash on their way home from Wichita, Kansas, where they participated in events surrounding the US Figure Skating Championships.\n\n\u201cThe Livingstons were just \u2013 they were just a big personality family. They were loving, they were thoughtful. Donna and Peter were extraordinarily supportive parents. They were loving parents. They were doing anything for their children,\u201d Urban said. \u201cAlydia and Everly were, like, bright children, very talented skaters and super bubbly.\u201d\n\nAfter the family boarded the flight, Donna took photos of her smiling family and sent them to Jin Ah Longerbeam, a close family friend whose children practiced skating with the Livingstons.\n\nEvery time the Longerbeams visited the Livingstons, Jin Ah said it was a \u201cjoyous\u201d time and there was always a point for everyone to sit down and eat dinner together. \u201cOriginally it was just skating, because we\u2019d see each other at the rink and then it just turned into sharing our lives together,\u201d Longerbeam said.\n\nEverly and Alydia were both very artistic and talented, young skaters who were passionate about skating. \u201cThese were the kids that would\u2019ve represented the USA,\u201d Longerbeam said.\n\nFemale Black Hawk pilot \u2018excelled in everything\u2019\n\nRebecca Lobach UNC Army ROTC\n\nThe female Black Hawk pilot who was co-piloting the aircraft when it collided with the passenger plane last week was a \u201cdriven and hardworking\u201d officer who \u201cwas made for\u201d Army aviation, those who knew her recalled to CNN on Saturday.\n\nThe Army officially identified the pilot as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, one of the three-person crew inside the UH-60 Black Hawk. While the Army released the names of the other two soldiers on board the Black Hawk on Friday, Lobach\u2019s name had been withheld at her family\u2019s request.\n\nCNN previously reported Lobach was co-piloting the Black Hawk at the time of the collision on Wednesday evening.\n\nA statement released Saturday by the Lobach family called her a \u201cbright star\u201d who was \u201ckind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious and strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebecca was a warrior and would not hesitate to defend her country in battle. But she was as graceful as she was fierce: in addition to her duties as an Army aviator, Rebecca was honored to serve as a White House Military Social Aide, volunteering to support the President and First Lady in hosting countless White House events, including ceremonies awarding the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said.\n\nCapt.

Tom Brenner/Getty Images/File\n\nCapt. Bilal Kordab, an Army officer who recruited Lobach into the North Carolina National Guard while she was a student at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, told CNN Lobach was \u201ca driven and hardworking individual that absolutely worked her tail off\u201d to accomplish what she did.\n\n\u201cShe was not handed anything. She was more than qualified for anything that she was able to accomplish,\u201d Kordab said. \u201cShe excelled in everything,\u201d including flight school. Lobach commissioned into the Army as an active-duty aviation officer from the ROTC program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2019.\n\nChief Warrant Officer 2 Sabrina Bell, who now serves in Alaska but who previously served with Lobach in the same company at the 12th Aviation Battalion, told CNN that Lobach was \u201chead-over-heels motivated\u201d from the moment she arrived at the unit.\n\nAs an officer, Lobach had a unique ability to connect with not only her soldiers but the leaders above her, Bell said. \u201cI can easily say she is one of the best leaders that I have ever had,\u201d Bell said.\n\nTwo more soldiers aboard the Black Hawk\n\nAir collision victim Ryan O'Hara is pictured.

Ryan leaves behind a wife and 1-year-old son,\u201d the school\u2019s Junior Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps wrote in a statement obtained by WSB.\n\nO\u2019Hara was a crew chief by trade, Muehlendorf told CNN, explaining his \u201cmilitary occupational specialty was a 15T and he was originally trained to be a maintainer of Black Hawk helicopters.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hara\u2019s responsibilities expanded and he began teaching other crew chiefs how to properly execute crew duties in the back of a Black Hawk, Muehlendorf said.\n\nMuehlendorf recalled O\u2019Hara as a man with a deep love for his family.\n\n\u201cI remember being longwinded in a debrief and he had to tell me that he had a date night planned. The debrief promptly ended,\u201d Muehlendorf said.\n\n\u201cA huge loss to Army Aviation and the world around him.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFourteen years ago, on a snowy evening in Philadelphia, Ellen Greenberg was found dead on the kitchen floor of her apartment. She had 20 knife wounds and numerous bruises. Authorities ruled her death a suicide.\n\nGreenberg was a 27-year-old schoolteacher. Her parents insisted she\u2019d been murdered. They fought to have the ruling amended. Now, after years of investigation, multiple lawsuits, and an online petition that has drawn more than 166,000 signatures, the pathologist who performed her autopsy says he has changed his mind.\n\nDr. Marlon Osbourne signed a document Friday saying that after considering new information in the case he no longer believes that Greenberg killed herself. Greenberg\u2019s parents resolved their claims against Osbourne over the weekend, one of their attorneys said.\n\nAnd on Monday, just before a jury could be impaneled in a separate suit by the Greenbergs against various city officials, the remaining parties reached a settlement in both lawsuits. The Greenbergs were seeking damages for what they called a \u201cconspiracy to cover-up Ellen\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia city spokesperson Ava Schwemler said that while city officials did not admit liability, the Greenbergs will receive a monetary payment \u2014 the amount of which will be disclosed at a later date \u2014 and the city\u2019s Medical Examiner\u2019s Office will re-examine the Greenberg case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d Greenberg\u2019s mother, Sandee, told CNN by phone after she heard the news of Dr. Osbourne\u2019s reversal. \u201cI mean, never in my wildest dreams did I think anything like this was gonna happen.\u201d\n\nAll these developments could clear the way for what Greenberg\u2019s parents have wanted all along: a criminal investigation into their daughter\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThis is what they\u2019ve been fighting for,\u201d said Will Trask, one of their attorneys.\n\nOsbourne\u2019s attorney, Marc Bailkin, declined to comment when reached by phone.\n\nWhen a CNN reporter asked if the statement attributed to Osbourne was authentic, he said, \u201cIt is. It speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nThe pathologist initially ruled Greenberg\u2019s death a homicide\n\nIt all began on January 26, 2011. At 6:30 p.m, Greenberg\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Sam Goldberg, called 911 and said, \u201cI just walked into my apartment; my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s on the floor with blood everywhere.\u201d\n\nMore than two minutes passed before Goldberg first mentioned a shocking detail: A knife was sticking out of Ellen\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cShe stabbed herself!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d the 911 operator said.\n\n\u201cShe fell on a knife,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nThe next day, Dr. Osbourne conducted an autopsy. He noted the many stab wounds, as well as bruises in various stages of healing. Writing that she was \u201cstabbed by another person,\u201d he ruled the case a homicide.\n\nEllen Greenberg and her fianc\u00e9, Sam Goldberg, in an undated photo. Courtesy Greenberg Family\n\nBut the Philadelphia police treated the death as a suicide from the beginning. Investigators were so convinced Ellen had killed herself that they released the scene without calling in the Crime Scene Unit.\n\nBy the time investigators returned, the apartment had been professionally cleaned. Potential evidence had been washed away.\n\nThe police held fast to their determination of suicide \u2014 partly because it appeared that Ellen had been alone when she died. Investigators thought the door was fastened from the inside by a swing bar latch, and initial reports indicated that Goldberg had been accompanied by a security guard while forcing open the door.\n\nOsbourne later said in a deposition, \u201cshe\u2019s the only one found in the apartment, with nothing disturbed, nothing out of place, no other way of getting in there, it doesn\u2019t lend to the fact that someone else was there to do it. So that was discounted.\u201d\n\nAfter conferring with law-enforcement officials, Osbourne amended the death certificate to \u201csuicide.\u201d Officially, Ellen Greenberg had killed herself.\n\nBut her parents did not accept that conclusion. As they later said, they wanted to exonerate their daughter. And one by one, they found experts who agreed.\n\nThe noted pathologist Cyril Wecht said the case was \u201cstrongly suspicious of homicide.\u201d A crime-scene reconstructionist said it appeared Greenberg\u2019s body had been moved. And another outside pathologist, Wayne Ross, pointed out a hemorrhage in her neck muscles that he thought was indicative of strangulation. He wrote that the various bruises on her body \u201cwere consistent with a repeated beating.\u201d\n\nAs for the claims about the apartment door, those were less certain than they first appeared.\n\nMelissa Ware, who managed Greenberg\u2019s apartment building, told CNN that the latched door didn\u2019t prove Greenberg had locked herself in. It was possible, she said, that the latch swung by itself in response to a closing door. It had happened to her, she said.\n\nA person bikes by Apex Manayunk, the apartment building where Ellen Greenberg died, in Philadelphia on November 20, 2024. Hannah Beier for CNN\n\nA security guard said he had not been there when the fianc\u00e9 forced open the door. And despite two relatives\u2019 claims that they\u2019d been on the phone with Goldberg when he forced open the door, a CNN analysis of phone records and other evidence seemed to contradict that claim.\n\nLast November, Goldberg gave a statement to CNN lamenting what he called \u201cthe pathetic and despicable attempts to desecrate my reputation and her privacy by creating a narrative that embraces lies, distortions and falsehoods in order to avoid the truth. Mental illness is very real and has many victims.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, a judge issued a ruling that would have allowed the Greenbergs\u2019 second lawsuit to go to a jury trial. A series of legal maneuvers followed. And Dr. Osbourne \u2014 now a pathologist in Pompano Beach, Florida \u2014 signed a document that amended his long-held position on Greenberg\u2019s death.\n\nOsbourne now says new information has led him to doubt his earlier ruling\n\nOsbourne wrote, \u201cit is my professional opinion Ellen\u2019s manner of death should be designated as something other than suicide.\u201d\n\nTrask, one of the Greenbergs\u2019 attorneys, said Osbourne produced the statement as a way of resolving the lawsuit with the Greenbergs. He said the Greenbergs agreed Monday to release Osbourne from the suit.\n\nOsbourne\u2019s statement cited \u201cadditional information\u201d he\u2019d gotten since he issued the amended death certificate:\n\n\u201cI am now aware that information exists which draws into question, for example, whether Ellen\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was witnessed entering the apartment before placing the 9-1-1 call on January 26, 2011; whether the door was forced open as reported; whether Ellen\u2019s body was moved by someone else inside the apartment with her at or near the time of her death; and the findings of Lindsey Emery, M.D. from her neuropathological evaluation of Ellen\u2019s cervical segment sample.\u201d\n\nDr. Marlon Osbourne, the former Philadelphia pathologist, later moved to Florida. As an assistant medical examiner for Palm Beach County, he's seen here testifying during the penalty phase of Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz's 2022 trial in Fort Lauderdale. Mike Stocker/Pool/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nEmery, a neuropathologist for the Philadelphia Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, said in a 2021 deposition that it appeared Greenberg had been stabbed in the back of her neck after she was dead. She later filed a declaration walking back that conclusion and saying there could have been other explanations for the lack of vital response in one of her wounds.\n\nWith Osbourne\u2019s departure, that left two defendants as jury selection began Monday morning: Sam Gulino, the city\u2019s former chief medical examiner; and police Det. John McNamee. Both have denied wrongdoing in the case.\n\nJust before 11:30 a.m., one of Greenberg\u2019s relatives at the courthouse reported that the jurors had been dismissed. Minutes later, Greenberg attorney Joe Podraza gave a statement to reporters.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved the matter,\u201d he said, adding that the Greenbergs\u2019 second lawsuit, demanding the medical examiner\u2019s office change its ruling on Ellen\u2019s cause of death, had also been settled. That suit was pending before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to the city\u2019s police department, medical examiner\u2019s office, and mayor\u2019s office, as well as two attorneys representing Gulino and McNamee. None had responded by the time of this article\u2019s publication.\n\nDr. Osbourne\u2019s new conclusion is not binding on the city. He acknowledged in his statement that \u201cI am no longer empowered to amend Ellen\u2019s death certificate myself because I no longer maintain a Pennsylvania medical license and am no longer employed by the Philadelphia Medical Examiner\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nJosh and Sandee Greenberg pose for a portrait with a picture of their daughter Ellen in November 2021. Dan Gleiter/PennLive\n\n\u201cLook, the Greenbergs have been fighting this for 14 years,\u201d said Trask, one of their attorneys. \u201cThey\u2019re exhausted. They spent their retirement on this case. They\u2019re ready for closure.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201call they wanted was for Dr. Osbourne to admit that he was wrong, and that their daughter didn\u2019t kill herself. And that\u2019s what they got. And the rest of it was icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nReached by phone on Monday afternoon, Greenberg\u2019s father, Josh, said it felt as if he\u2019d just taken and passed a very difficult test.\n\n\u201cWe fought very long to get this,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get justice for our daughter. And we did.\u201d",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nJust offshore from the towering national monuments of Washington, a tall crane now hovers over the Potomac River. It casts a large shadow over the ongoing effort to understand what caused the collision of a passenger jet and a military helicopter last Wednesday, as a new phase of the recovery started Monday.\n\nCrews have begun removing large parts of the wreckage of American Airlines Flight 5342, the regional jet whose fuselage came to rest upside-down in three pieces after running directly into an Army Black Hawk helicopter, taking the lives of everyone aboard both aircraft. It\u2019s the deadliest US aviation disaster in more than 20 years.\n\nMonday\u2019s work was painstaking and slow. A jet engine was the first piece of debris to emerge from the frigid water, slowly raised by the crane. Video taken from shore showed salvage workers guiding it gently to the deck of a barge. From a distance, most of the engine\u2019s cowling and exhaust nozzle appeared intact.\n\nIt took another two hours before a second piece of the plane was pulled out \u2013 a jagged portion of the fuselage that was not immediately identifiable.\n\nA crane retrieves a jet engine from the wreckage of Flight 5342 after recovery operations began in the Potomac River on Monday. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nHere\u2019s the latest on the recovery operations and the investigation into the cause:\n\nRemoving wreckage to take over a week\n\nThe salvage work began after divers spent the weekend getting a view of what people on the surface cannot see \u2013 the full extent of the underwater debris field \u2013 developing a plan to recover the jet wreckage they believe will take the rest of the week. Pulling out the wreck of the helicopter is scheduled to take another four days.\n\nBut the US Army Corps of Engineers \u2013 which is managing the recovery operation \u2013 says the exact timeline cannot be certain because not all victims have been identified. If more human remains are found during the wreckage removal, they will pause.\n\n\u201cThe dignified recovery of missing flight passengers and personnel takes precedence,\u201d Col. Francis Pera, commander of the Corps\u2019 Baltimore District, said Sunday.\n\nThe remains of 55 of the 67 victims have been identified, according to a news briefing Monday. Those victims included 28 athletes, coaches and family members associated with US Figure Skating. Many of them were participants in the national championships in Wichita and a development camp which followed, the organization said.\n\nThe NTSB said Monday the agency is working to get the airplane \u2013 a Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet - out first, before the helicopter, a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk.\n\nThe bodies of the victims yet to be recovered are believed to be within the wreckage of the two aircraft, according to Gary Steen, DC Fire and EMS assistant fire chief.\n\nSteen said the divers working through the recovery process are dealing with \u201ceverything imaginable that you can think of \u2026 day in and day out.\u201d\n\nRecovery crews began their work under clear skies but have been working in water hovering around just 36 degrees. By Wednesday, inclement weather is forecast to return to Washington, with a possibility of rain and sleet.\n\nPera said Monday\u2019s recovery efforts were successful.\n\n\u201cThroughout the day we\u2019ve had some success. The first of the two engines was removed at about 10 o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d Pera said, adding the fuselage was pulled about two hours later and a wing at about 2:30 p.m.\n\nOfficials said they are on pace to recover jet\u2019s cockpit Tuesday, wind gusts and tidal levels permitting.\n\nNew black box data to be released\n\nThe first sign the pilot of one of the aircraft may have seen the other before the collision came to light over the weekend: The National Transportation Safety Board says the jet\u2019s flight data recorder has an indication the plane\u2019s nose came up just before the disaster.\n\n\u201cAt one point very close to the impact, there was a slight change in pitch, an increase in pitch,\u201d NTSB member Todd Inman said at a Saturday evening news conference.\n\nA key question in the investigation is whether the Black Hawk helicopter was higher than the 200-foot altitude limit it was supposed to observe as it flew a designed route along the eastern bank of the Potomac.\n\nInman said the Bombardier jet\u2019s flight data recorder gives an altitude reading of about 325 feet at the time of impact, but air traffic controllers never had an indication the helicopter went above 200 feet.\n\nThe NTSB recovered the so-called black box of the Black Hawk helicopter, the agency said Sunday. Board chairperson Jennifer Homendy told CNN on Monday information was recovered from the flight data recorder.\n\n\u201cThey have gotten information, downloads from that (black box),\u201d said Homendy, \u201cand now they\u2019re taking that data and making sure that it\u2019s accurate, that the time stamps are right to try to marry it up with the (black box) data from the plane in order to provide that information publicly.\u201d\n\nThe black box is critical, Homendy said, because the DC tower radar does not provide a constant readout of aircraft altitude, updating only every five seconds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that occurs in five seconds, especially when a helicopter is moving at a pretty good clip,\u201d she said.\n\nLater Monday, the NTSB said the flight data recorder for the Black Hawk did not have timestamps.\n\n\u201cInvestigators will have to manually create timestamps, which requires additional time to validate,\u201d the release said.\n\nNTSB releases photos from the Jan. 29 Bombardier CRJ700 and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk mid-air collision on the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport: https://t.co/YAj2MO2tXA pic.twitter.com/BLVf0N7ASE \u2014 NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) February 2, 2025\n\n\u201cThe issue is going to become did the readout come from the helicopter? Was it tower equipment that misinterpreted?\u201d said CNN transportation analyst Mary Schiavo, former inspector general at the Department of Transportation.\n\nIf the radar gave air traffic controllers bad readings, Schiavo said, investigators will want to look at maintenance records.\n\n\u201cThe air traffic controllers don\u2019t repair that tower equipment,\u201d Schiavo told CNN\u2019s John Berman. \u201cThat is handled by contractors, and so now we\u2019re looking at another group of people. Who was repairing that tower equipment?\u201d\n\nA preliminary report from the NTSB is likely to still be a month away. Homendy says her entire agency was given an exemption to the Trump administration\u2019s blanket offer to most federal employees of what it described as a \u201cbuyout.\u201d She told CNN keeping their staffing level is critical to producing a timely report.\n\n\u201cWe have expert investigators,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people realize that we only have 436 employees for all modes of transportation, and so we are very small, and we do run lean, for example, our structural engineers. We only have two structural engineers in the entire agency for aviation, and there\u2019s not a lot of backup.\u201d\n\nBlack Hawk and tower actions under review\n\nThe altitude of the helicopter is still a key question to be answered, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, but there are others, as well.\n\n\u201cWere the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles? Did it affect their peripheral vision or perception?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat was happening inside the (air traffic control) tower?\u201d Duffy added. \u201cWere they understaffed?\u201d\n\nOn the night of the crash, a single controller was handling approach traffic for both planes and helicopters, an air traffic control source told CNN.\n\nNormally those jobs are performed by two people, although the source and the air traffic controllers\u2019 union said it was not uncommon for those duties to be combined.\n\nEven as evidence continues to be collected from tapes and pulled from the water, the former director of the FAA\u2019s Office of Accident Investigation says he\u2019s confident the cause of the disaster will be unambiguous.\n\n\u201cWe have radar data, we have eyewitnesses and we have all the wreckage,\u201d Steven Wallace told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing missing.\u201d\n\nAndy Rose wrote this story from Atlanta, with reporting from Pete Muntean in Washington, DC.

But Jeff Levy sees a chance to find their treasured keepsakes during their greatest time of need.\n\nArmed with metal detectors, a shovel, sifting screens and a 60-pound magnet, Levy has helped recover belongings for wildfire victims for more than 30 years \u2013 bringing tears of joy and shrieks of elation to despondent victims who have lost most everything else.\n\n\u201cI want to do this just to help,\u201d Levy said, taking a break from his search through \u201cmuddy ash\u201d in the Pacific Palisades. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to take any money.\u201d\n\nAn antique toy dealer by trade, Levy has put his affinity for metal detecting to good use.\n\nSince the recent Southern California wildfires ravaged Los Angeles-area communities, Levy has saved an elderly man\u2019s retirement stash; retrieved a couple\u2019s diamond engagement ring; and salvaged a symbolic gold heirloom just in time for the Lunar New Year.\n\n\u2018Not all heroes wear capes\u2019\n\nHours after the deadly Eaton Fire broke out, Mark Pastor\u2019s cat woke him up at 2:30 a.m. He looked out the window to see a \u201cfirestorm\u201d racing toward his house.\n\nPastor and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa De Lange, grabbed their pets and sprinted out the door \u2013 leaving behind her diamond engagement ring.\n\nThe flames engulfed their Altadena house. Days later, the newly homeless couple was staying in a motel when a mutual friend connected them with Levy.\n\n\u201cThe big thing that we wanted more than anything was to find her ring,\u201d Pastor said.\n\nWhen Levy and Pastor trekked back to Altadena, \u201cit was like a bomb was dropped on the neighborhood,\u201d Pastor said.\n\n\u201cSeeing the house, it was just devastating.

Courtesy Jeff Levy\n\nWhen Pastor returned the fire-warped ring to De Lange, \u201cit was better than when he gave it to me the first time,\u201d she said.\n\nLevy didn\u2019t just find the couple\u2019s buried treasure \u2013 he also gave them renewed hope for the future.\n\n\u201cSince then, it helped me kind of get my feet back on the ground,\u201d De Lange said.\n\n\u201cNot all heroes wear capes.\u201d\n\nA lifetime of savings spared\n\nThe \u201cmost interesting and probably the most valuable\u201d find came when Levy helped a man recover his retirement fund \u2013 which had been stashed in a closet.\n\nThe retired teacher \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable with the economy during the beginning of Covid and converted all of his retirement into gold bars and literally put them in the closet, in a shoebox,\u201d Levy said.\n\nBut this hunt for buried gold was treacherous.\n\nAfter a perilous search on a hillside, Jeff Levy finds a retired teacher's retirement fund, which had been converted to gold bars. Courtesy Jeff Levy\n\n\u201cThey lived in a two-story apartment on a hillside on Sunset in the Palisades. \u2026 It was a little scary because it was on a hillside. There was a lot of falling debris and a lot of walls that looked like they could cave in,\u201d Levy said.\n\n\u201cSo as safely as I could, I cleared a lot of that debris. I cut through the chicken wire that was inside the drywall on the walls,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI started shoveling into a two-part sifting screen, and in a very short time \u2013 I think about an hour \u2013 all of a sudden, I saw the rectangular shapes and the glitter of gold under the ash,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo his whole retirement is back to him, in his possession now.\u201d\n\n\u2018A very good sign for better things to come\u2019\n\nWhile Levy was helping another family in the Palisades, he noticed Ken Lin struggling for hours to find heirlooms in the torched remains of his childhood home \u2013 small Chinese gold ingots.\n\n\u201cMy parents aren\u2019t really into material possessions,\u201d Lin said. \u201cBut they did want to go back to look for this gold in particular.\u201d\n\nEngraved ingots made of real or imitation gold are staples in many Chinese homes for Lunar New Year \u2013 which was only days away. The keepsakes symbolize prosperity \u2013 something that seemed implausible for the family that lost everything.\n\nSo Levy grabbed a shovel and helped dig through the Lins\u2019 rubble with them.\n\nThis gold ingot has \"double happiness\" written in Chinese. Courtesy Jeff Levy\n\n\u201cI set up a (sifting) screen, and right away I found\u201d a gold ingot, Levy said. The family \u201cwas shocked that I found it so quickly because they were digging for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe small, golden nugget had a message engraved in Chinese: \u201cDouble happiness.\u201d\n\nLin was stunned by Levy\u2019s benevolence and skill. \u201cHe had the strategy and the tools,\u201d Lin said. \u201cHe\u2019s like the angel of debris.\u201d\n\nKen Lin spent hours sifting through the wreckage of his childhood home before a stranger, Jeff Levy, came and found a cherished gold ingot for the family. Courtesy Jeff Levy\n\nLevy said he\u2019s grateful he recovered the symbolic treasure for the family before Lunar New Year \u2013 a time for purging bad luck and celebrating hope for a prosperous year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a coincidence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it was a very good sign for better things to come after the tragedy.\u201d",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nAs New Orleans church leaders braced for the fallout from publishing a list of predatory Catholic priests, they turned to an unlikely ally: the front office of the city\u2019s NFL franchise.\n\nWhat followed was a months-long, crisis-communications blitz orchestrated by the New Orleans Saints\u2019 president and other top team officials, according to hundreds of internal emails obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe records, which the Saints and church had long sought to keep out of public view, reveal team executives played a more extensive role than previously known in a public relations campaign to mitigate fallout from the clergy sexual abuse crisis. The emails shed new light on the Saints\u2019 foray into a fraught topic far from the gridiron, a behind-the-scenes effort driven by the team\u2019s devoutly Catholic owner who has long enjoyed a close relationship with the city\u2019s embattled archbishop.\n\nThey also showed how various New Orleans institutions \u2014 from a sitting federal judge to the local media \u2014 rallied around church leaders at a critical moment.\n\nAmong the key moments, as revealed in the Saints\u2019 own emails:\n\n\u2014 Saints executives were so involved in the church\u2019s damage control that a team spokesman briefed his boss on a 2018 call with the city\u2019s top prosecutor hours before the church released a list of clergymen accused of abuse. The call, the spokesman said, \u201callowed us to take certain people off\u201d the list.\n\n\u2014 Team officials were among the first people outside the church to view that list, a carefully curated, yet undercounted roster of suspected pedophiles. The disclosure of those names invited civil claims against the church and drew attention from federal and state law enforcement.\n\n\u2014 The team\u2019s president, Dennis Lauscha, drafted more than a dozen questions that Archbishop Gregory Aymond should be prepared to answer as he faced reporters.\n\nNew Orleans Saints president Dennis Lauscha is seen before an NFL preseason football game against the Los Angeles Chargers in August 2022. Tyler Kaufman/AP\n\n\u2014 The Saints\u2019 senior vice president of communications, Greg Bensel, provided fly-on-the-wall updates to Lauscha about local media interviews, suggesting church and team leaders were all on the same team. \u201cHe is doing well,\u201d Bensel wrote as the archbishop told reporters the church was committed to addressing the crisis. \u201cThat is our message,\u201d Bensel added, \u201cthat we will not stop here today.\u201d\n\nThe emails obtained by AP sharply undercut assurances the Saints gave fans about the public relations guidance five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the church. The team went to court to keep its internal emails secret.\n\n\u201cThis is disgusting,\u201d said state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans. \u201cAs a New Orleans resident, taxpayer and Catholic, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me why the Saints would go to these lengths to protect grown men who raped children. All of them should have been just as horrified at the allegations.\u201d\n\nThe Saints told AP last week that the partnership is a thing of the past. The emails cover a yearlong period ending in July 2019, when they were subpoenaed by attorneys for victims of a priest later charged with raping an 8-year-old boy.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, the team criticized the media for using \u201cleaked emails for the purpose of misconstruing a well-intended effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\u201d the team said. \u201cThat abuse occurred is a terrible fact.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s response did little to quell the anger of survivors of clergy sexual abuse. \u201cWe felt betrayed by the organization,\u201d said Kevin Bourgeois, a former Saints season ticket holder who was abused by a priest in the 1980s. \u201cIt forces me to question what other secrets are being withheld. I\u2019m angry, hurt and re-traumatized again.\u201d\n\nEmails reveal extent of help\n\nAfter the AP first reported on the alliance in early 2020, Saints owner Gayle Benson denied that anyone \u201cassociated with our organizations made recommendations or had input\u201d on the list of pedophile priests.\n\nThe Saints reiterated that denial in its statement Saturday, saying no Saints employees \u201chad any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list.\u201d The team said that no employees offered \u201cany input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from\u201d the list.\n\nLeon Cannizzaro, the district attorney at the time, last week denied any role in shaping the credibly accused clergy list, echoing statements he made in 2020. He told AP he \u201cabsolutely had no involvement in removing any names from any list.\u201d Cannizzaro said he did not know why the Saints\u2019 spokesman would have reported he had been on a call related to the list.\n\nThe emails, sent from Saints accounts, don\u2019t specify which clergymen were removed from the list or why. They raise fresh questions, however, about the Saints\u2019 role in a scandal that has taken on much larger legal and financial stakes since the team waded into it, potentially in violation of the NFL\u2019s policy against conduct \u201cdetrimental to the league.\u201d\n\nA coalescing of New Orleans institutions\n\nThe outsized role of Saints executives could draw new attention from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is scheduled to address reporters Monday as New Orleans prepares to host its 11th Super Bowl. Messages requesting comment were sent to the NFL.\n\nTaken together, the emails portray a coalescing of several New Orleans institutions. U.S. District Court Judge Jay Zainey, who was copied by the Saints on the public relations efforts, cheered Bensel on from his personal email account, thanking the team\u2019s spokesman \u201cfor the wonderful advice.\u201d A newspaper editor similarly thanked Bensel for getting involved.\n\n\u201cYou have hit all the points,\u201d Zainey, a fellow Catholic, wrote in another email to Bensel, praising a lengthy note the Saints spokesman sent to local newspaper editors. \u201cBy his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our Church in the right direction \u2014 helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.\u201d\n\nZainey later struck down a Louisiana law, vigorously opposed by the church, that would have allowed victims to bring civil claims irrespective of how long ago the alleged sex abuse took place. He declined to comment.\n\nA watershed moment for the Catholic Church\n\nThe list marked a watershed in heavily Catholic New Orleans \u2014 a long-awaited mea culpa to parishioners intended to usher in healing and local accountability. It came at a time when church leaders were seeking to retain public trust \u2014 and financial support \u2014 as they reckoned with generations of abuse and mounting litigation that eventually drove the Archdiocese of New Orleans into bankruptcy.\n\nThat litigation, filed in 2020, involves more than 600 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case has produced a trove of still-secret church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of church leaders transferring clergy without reporting their crimes to law enforcement.\n\nWhile it has since expanded, the list of accused priests was missing a number of clergy when it was originally released, an earlier AP investigation found.\n\nThe AP identified 20 clergymen who had been accused in lawsuits or charged by law enforcement with child sexual abuse who were inexplicably omitted from the New Orleans list \u2014 including two who were charged and convicted of crimes.\n\nStill, the list has served as a roadmap for both the FBI and Louisiana State Police, which launched sweeping investigations into New Orleans church leaders\u2019 shielding of predatory priests.\n\nLast spring, state police carried out a wide-ranging search warrant at the Archdiocese of New Orleans, seizing records that include communications with the Vatican.\n\nSince the Saints began assisting the archdiocese, at least seven current and former members of the local clergy have been charged with crimes ranging from rape to possession of child pornography.\n\nPublic relations campaign\n\nThe extent of the abuse remained largely unknown in 2018, a year the Saints won nine consecutive games on the way to an NFC Championship appearance. As the church prepped for a media onslaught, Bensel carried out an aggressive public relations campaign in which he called in favors, prepared talking points and leaned on long-time media contacts to support the church through a \u201csoon-to-be-messy\u201d time.\n\nFar from freelancing, Bensel had the Saints\u2019 backing and blessing through what he called a \u201cGalileo moment,\u201d suggesting Aymond would be a trailblazer in releasing a credibly accused clergy list at a critical time for the church. In emails to editorial boards, he warned against \u201ccasting a critical eye\u201d on the archbishop \u201cis neither beneficial nor right.\u201d\n\nHe urged the city\u2019s newspapers to \u201cwork with\u201d the church, reminding them the Saints and New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 the city\u2019s NBA team, also owned by Benson \u2014 had been successful thanks, in part, to their support.\n\n\u201cWe did this because we had buy-in from YOU,\u201d Bensel wrote to the editors of The Times-Picayune and New Orleans Advocate, \u201csupporting our mission to be the best, to make New Orleans and everything within her bounds the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are sitting on that opportunity now with the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess.\u201d\n\nClose relationship between Saints and the Catholic Church\n\nBenson and Aymond, the archbishop, have been confidants for years. It was the archbishop who introduced Benson to her late husband, Tom Benson, who died in 2018, leaving his widow in control of New Orleans\u2019 NFL and NBA franchises.\n\nThe Bensons\u2019 foundation has given tens of millions of dollars to the archdiocese and other Catholic causes. Along the way, Aymond has flown on the owner\u2019s private jet and become almost a part of the team, frequently celebrating pregame Masses.\n\nWhen the clergy abuse allegations came to a head, Bensel, the Saints\u2019 spokesman, worked his contacts in the local media to help shape the story. He had friendly email exchanges with a Times-Picayune columnist who praised the archbishop for releasing the clergy list. He also asked the newspaper\u2019s leadership to keep their communications \u201cconfidential, not for publication nor to share with others.\u201d\n\nHis emails revealed that The Advocate \u2013 after Aymond privately complained to the publisher \u2014 removed a notice from one online article that had called for clergy abuse victims to reach out.\n\nKevin Hall, president and publisher of Georges Media, which owns the newspaper, said the publication welcomes engagement from community leaders but that outreach \u201cdoes not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOver the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL-TV and by The Associated Press.\u201d\n\nIt was The Advocate\u2019s reporting that prompted Bensel to help the church, the emails show. He first offered to \u201cchat crisis communications\u201d with church leaders after the newspaper exposed a scandal involving a disgraced deacon, George Brignac, who remained a lay minister even after the archdiocese settled claims he raped an 8-year-old altar boy.\n\n\u201cWe have been through enough at Saints to be a help or sounding board,\u201d Bensel wrote, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to overstep!\u201d",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nA lawsuit alleging for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment has been filed ahead of Monday\u2019s second anniversary of the toxic crash near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border amid a flurry of new litigation.\n\nOn Monday, Vice President JD Vance is also expected to visit the small community near the crash site that he used to represent as a senator, along with President Donald Trump\u2019s newly confirmed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin.\n\nThe new lawsuit that will be made public later on Monday contains the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad \u2014 including the death of a 1-week-old baby. It also alleges the railroad, and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to warn residents about the health risks. Many of the other parties in the lawsuit cite lingering, unexplained health problems along with concerns something more serious could develop.\n\n\u201cOur clients want truth. They want transparency,\u201d attorney Kristina Baehr said about the roughly 750 people she represents. \u201cThey want to know what they were exposed to, which has been hidden from them. They want to know what happened and why it happened. And they want accountability.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit provides some examples of the lingering effects on families, but it doesn\u2019t include details about the deaths.\n\nAt least nine other lawsuits were filed over the past week by individuals and businesses that argue the railroad\u2019s greed is to blame for the derailment and the $600 million class-action settlement doesn\u2019t offer nearly enough compensation nor sanction the railroad enough to spur them to prevent future derailments. The dollar amount represents only a small fraction of the $12.1 billion in revenue the railroad generated in each of the past two years.\n\nDozens of rail cars careened off the tracks on Feb. 3, 2023, after an overheating bearing failed. Several of the cars carrying hazardous materials ruptured and spilled their cargo that caught fire. But the disaster was made worse three days later when officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride and burned that toxic plastic ingredient because they feared it would explode.\n\nInvestigators from the National Transportation Safety Board determined the controversial vent and burn operation never needed to be done because there was evidence the railroad ignored that the tank cars were actually starting to cool off and wouldn\u2019t explode. The state and local officials who ultimately made the decision to release and burn the vinyl chloride \u2014 generating a towering plume of thick, black smoke that spread over the town and region \u2014 have said they never heard anything suggesting the tank cars wouldn\u2019t explode.\n\nA black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled burn of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains Monday, Feb. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Gene J. Puskar/AP\n\n\u201cThe EPA had rules to follow and chose not to follow their own rules. The EPA was too busy trying to get the train back on track to protect the people,\u201d Baehr said.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions about the new lawsuit and separate federal claims that were filed against the EPA and CDC. But in the past the EPA has defended the agency\u2019s role in the vent and burn operation by saying they were only there to advise on the potential consequences and measure the resulting contamination.\n\nBaehr said the EPA and CDC\u2019s approach to the derailment followed a similar pattern she\u2019s seen in other environmental disasters she\u2019s been involved with like the Navy\u2019s toxic spill of jet fuel that contaminated water in Hawaii. She said the agencies tend to downplay the health risks people face. Residents have expressed frustration with the data the EPA discloses and the refusal of the class-action attorneys to reveal what their own testing expert found.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency workers work in Leslie Run in East Palestine, Ohio on Wednesday, June 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Gene J. Puskar/AP\n\nA spokesperson for Norfolk Southern railroad said she couldn\u2019t comment on the pending litigation. The railroad has agreed to the $600 million class-action settlement with residents who lived or worked within 20 miles of the derailment and a separate settlement with the federal government where Norfolk Southern pledged to pay for the entire cleanup and set up funds to pay for medical exams and drinking water monitoring. But the railroad did not admit any wrongdoing in either settlement.\n\nSome people who lived near the derailment have started to receive payments for personal injuries as part of the class-action settlement, but nearly half of the settlement remains on hold as some residents appeal for higher compensation and more information about the contamination.\n\nSo the main payments of up to $70,000 per household won\u2019t go out until the appeal is settled.\n\nThe nine other new lawsuits included claims by a pipe manufacturer, dog kennels and a winery that the derailment harmed their businesses in various ways, from staffing shortages to having to shut down or move because of customers\u2019 concerns.\n\nOne business about a quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometers) from the derailment alleged cleanup work created \u201csmoke, debris and odors\u201d that reached their property and led to routine flooding. The dog breeder who owned a business in neighboring Pennsylvania blamed the toxic chemicals for causing the deaths of at least 116 puppies and three adult dogs.",

(KION-TV) - In March 2023, the Pajaro levee was breached during winter storms, causing devastation to the surrounding communities.\n\nWhile those communities continue to recover, those affected counties are still feeling the financial impact.\n\n\u201cThat has created a huge budget problem and cash flow issue for our county,\u201d County Administrative Officer for Santa Cruz County Carlos Palacios said.\n\nSanta Cruz County said, they\u2019re still waiting on over $100 million in unpaid federal disaster reimbursement.\n\nAccording to Palacios, since 2017 Santa Cruz County has seen eight federally declared disasters.\n\nHowever, he said they\u2019ve only been able to recoup just over half of what they\u2019ve spent from state and federal partners, including FEMA.\n\n\u201cIt's created a lot of uncertainty in our budget process, because we just don't know if we're going to get reimbursed for some of these claims that we've submitted,\" Palacios said.\n\nOver in the County of Monterey, some disaster expenses from 2017 weren\u2019t reimbursed until just last year. On Oct. 15, the county moved forward with a hiring freeze, they said due in part to the financial impact from unpaid disaster expenses.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to get that FEMA money for five or six years, and it just hits it up at a bad time. Here, we've had quite a few disasters here in the last few years, from fires to floods,\" County of Monterey District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church said.\n\nSupervisor church adds, they\u2019re waiting on at least $70 million from FEMA. The lengthy reimbursement process is now contributing to financial worries for both counties.\n\nKION News asked FEMA is there are any ways to potentially streamline the process in order to get assistance out faster.\n\n\u201cA lot of our policy is based on the statutes that we're guided by, obviously and subject to, obviously, someone else's decision if they want to change law to assist us,\" FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer Andrew Grant said.\n\nSanta Cruz County Supervisor Zach Friend is one of the people advocating for reform in Washington D.C. with the reimbursement process.\n\n\"Their processes take too long, and they also are too bureaucratic. The good examples are their sister, their sister agency, the federal highways administration, which has a very streamlined and efficient process for funding us on road disaster,\" Palacios said.\n\n\u201cI've spoken to both counties and a lot of other applicants about the situation, and it's tough, because we have to go through this process. Nothing is eligible until it's eligible. And so I just try to caution them to not make any assumptions about what might be or what might not be,\" FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer Andrew Grant said.\n\nBoth Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties warn of future budget uncertainty as they wait for those funds. Some county officials KION spoke with are also calling on congress to take action to increase FEMA's operating budget.",

Young said he sought \u201cfirm commitments\u201d from Gabbard that will \u201cadvance our national security.\u201d He also had \u201cextensive conversations\u201d with Vice President JD Vance, who worked with Gabbard to give the Indiana Republican assurances to win over his critical vote for her nomination, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nYoung, who sits on Senate Intelligence and opposes any pardon for Edward Snowden, asked for assurances in writing, including disavowing her past statements saying she would protect any leaker of classified intelligence. She later sent him a letter detailing her views on whistleblowers, which satisfied Young.\n\nThe Indiana Republican Also reached out to President Donald Trump. Young has not always seen eye to eye with Trump and said in the spring of 2024 he wouldn\u2019t endorse Trump in his reelection. But, Young told CNN that the two men had a good and productive conversation over the weekend about Gabbard\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cI called him up. He called me back over the weekend and he called me back within the hour. It was a great conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr. advanced from the Senate Finance Committee earlier today. President Donald Trump said Monday that he has been involved in making calls to senators who have concerns about Gabbard and Kennedy.\n\nMore context: People close to Trump and those helping to confirm his nominees had been most concerned about Gabbard\u2019s confirmation chances, specifically after the former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii refused to say whether she believed the actions of Edward Snowden were traitorous to the US.\n\nGabbard has also drawn scrutiny from Senate Intelligence Committee lawmakers over her views on surveillance and a series of controversial meetings she held in Lebanon and Syria in 2017, including with then-President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Alayna Treene and Kit Maher contributed reporting.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional reporting on Young\u2019s decision to support Gabbard.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post misspelled Todd Young\u2019s first name.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers opened two dams on Friday in Central California and let roughly 2.2 billion gallons of water flow out of reservoirs, after President Donald Trump ordered the release with the misguided intent to send water to fire-ravaged Southern California.\n\nTrump celebrated the move in posts to Truth Social post on Friday and Sunday, declaring, \u201cthe water is flowing in California,\u201d and adding the water was \u201cheading to farmers throughout the State, and to Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nThere are two major problems, water experts said: The newly released water will not flow to Los Angeles, and it is being wasted by being released during the wet winter season.\n\n\u201cThey were holding extra water in those reservoirs because of the risk that it would be a dry summer,\u201d said Heather Cooley, director of research for California water policy organization the Pacific Institute. \u201cThis puts agriculture at risk of insufficient water during the summer months.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted that 1.6 billion gallons was being released adding that \u201cin 3 days, it will be 5.2 billion gallons.\u201d\n\nAbout 2.2 billion gallons were released from Friday to Sunday, local water districts said in a statement released Monday. That water was discharged into the dry lakebed of Tulare Lake, according to a letter from Sen. Alex Padilla to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.\n\n\u201cDownstream entities used these releases for limited irrigation demand and groundwater recharge,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThis release is extremely concerning,\u201d Cooley said. \u201cIt\u2019s providing zero benefit and putting California farmers at risk of water supply constraints in the coming months.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources director Karla Nemeth told reporters that there was little coordination between federal officials and the state and local water managers for the Army Corps releases at the Terminus Dam at Lake Kaweah and Schafer Dam at Lake Success.\n\n\u201cThese reservoirs were federal reservoirs, and the state of California was not part of the decision making in this instance,\u201d Nemeth said. \u201cWe traditionally have a high degree of coordination at the operational level, which really wasn\u2019t a part of this decision.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s State Water project supplies water from Northern California to Southern California, including to Los Angeles. Los Angeles\u2019 water supply comes partly from state reservoirs and partly from the Colorado River.\n\nBut Los Angeles\u2019 water sources are completely separated from the water system that Lake Kaweah and Lake Success supply. That water system flows into the agriculture-heavy Central Valley \u2014 where large farms grow nuts, citrus and grasses for animal feed, among other crops. The water-stressed region is heavily reliant on groundwater and winter precipitation stored in state reservoirs to irrigate crops.\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers and the White House did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.",

The suspected perpetrator also died.\n\nA large number of people were injured after a gunman opened fire at a campus in the city of \u00d6rebro in central Sweden, according to Roberto Eid Forest, the head of the city\u2019s police district.\n\nPolice said that the perpetrator was not known to them before the shooting and that he was not connected to any gangs. They also said there is currently no information indicating that the shooter acted based on ideological motives. Police did not say what type of weapon was used by the gunman.\n\n\u201cWe think he is a lone perpetrator,\u201d Forest said. He added that the shooting was \u201cextremely tragic, with many involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible event, it\u2019s exceptional \u2013 a nightmare,\u201d Forest added.\n\nSweden\u2019s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson offered his condolences to the victims and their families and thanked the police during a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve today seen brutal, deadly violence against completely innocent people \u2013 this is the worst mass shooting in Swedish history,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister, the country\u2019s Justice Minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer called it an \u201cunspeakably sad tragedy.\u201d\n\nThe shooting occurred inside Campus Risbergska \u2013 a school for adult education \u2013 which is located on a campus where other schools, including those for children, are based.\n\nOfficers were first called at around 12:30 p.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET), Forest said.\n\nSix people had been taken to the local university hospital, including five with gunshot wounds, according to Jonas Claesson, the regional health care director. Four had undergone surgery, including two who are now in a stable condition, he said.\n\nPolice at the scene of an incident at Campus Risbergska school. Kicki Nilsson/\ufeffTT News Agency/AP\n\nCNN affiliate Expressen reported earlier that there was an exchange of gunfire between the police and the perpetrator, quoting police spokesperson Lars Hedlin. It is unclear how many people were injured in total, but police said no officers were shot.\n\nThe public were urged to avoid the area and stay indoors.\n\nAuthorities cordon off the site of the shooting at school. Swedish police warned \"the danger is not over.\" Kicki Nilsson/TT News Agency/AP\n\nStudents are being transferred from schools next to the site of the shooting in \u00d6rebro, which lies 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of the Swedish capital, Stockholm.\n\nThe police said in a later update they were investigating various addresses in \u00d6rebro and that work at the crime scene continued. \u201cAt the moment, the police believe that the perpetrator was acting alone, but we cannot rule out more perpetrators connected to the incident,\u201d it said.\n\nSweden\u2019s King Carl XVI Gustaf said his family received the news of the shooting \u201cwith sadness and dismay\u201d in a written statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTonight we send our condolences to the families and friends of the deceased. Our thoughts at this moment also go to the injured and their relatives as well as others affected,\u201d the king said, adding his \u201cappreciation\u201d to the emergency services \u201cwho worked intensively to save and secure human lives on this dark day.\u201d\n\n\u2018We heard three bangs\u2019\n\nOne eyewitness recalled sounds of terror filling the corridors of the school, the Associated Press reported, citing Sweden\u2019s Expressen newspaper.\n\n\u201cWe heard three bangs and loud screams,\u201d Andreas Sundling, 28, said while sheltering in a classroom. \u201cNow we\u2019re sitting here waiting to be evacuated from the school. The information we have received is that we should sit and wait.\u201d\n\nThe Risbergska school offers courses at elementary school and high school level for students ages 20 and over \u2013 including classes for immigrants, as well as vocational training.\n\nThere were an unusually low number of students on campus at the time of the attack, according to a teacher at the school. Many students had left campus after taking a national exam Tuesday, Lena Warenmark told state broadcaster SVT News, according to the Associated Press.\n\nScandinavian authorities have worked to crack down on gun violence over recent years, following an uptick in deadly gang-related shootings.\n\nIn 2024, at least 40 people were shot dead there, according to Reuters. That year, police said they prevented more than 100 serious crimes. In 2023, Sweden tallied the highest rate of gun violence per capita.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Kristersson had called for an investigation into \u201chow these horrific crimes could have occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is with sadness that I have received information about the terrible act of violence in \u00d6rebro. My thoughts are with those who have been affected and their relatives. It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,\u201d Kristersson posted on X.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with terror. Being confined to a classroom with fear for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience,\u201d he added.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration has begun drafting an executive order that would kick off the process of eliminating the Department of Education, the latest move by President Donald Trump to swiftly carry out his campaign promises, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.\n\nThe move would come in two parts, the sources said. The order would direct the secretary of Education to create a plan to diminish the department through executive action.\n\nTrump would also push for Congress to pass legislation to end the department, as those working on the order acknowledge that shuttering the department would require Congress\u2019 involvement.\n\nThe president said Tuesday he wants his secretary of Education pick, Linda McMahon, to \u201cput herself out of a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Linda, \u2018Linda, I hope you do a great job in putting yourself out of a job.\u2019 I want her to put herself out of a job \u2013 Education Department,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMcMahon, who served as the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term, has yet to have a confirmation hearing for the top education post.\n\nWhile calls to abolish the Education Department or merge it with another federal agency are not new, the move has historically failed to get support from Congress.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term as president, his administration proposed merging the Education and Labor Departments into one federal agency. Even though Republicans controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives at the time, the proposal did not go anywhere.\n\nThis year, the Education Department is simultaneously being targeted by the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, as CNN previously reported.\n\nDozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave Friday as part of the Trump administration\u2019s larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly pointed to the department as a sign of federal overreach and tied it to culture war issues. \u201cWe will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America\u2019s youth with all sorts of things that you don\u2019t want to have our youth hearing,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump, an advocate for policies that make it easier for families to spend taxpayer funds on private education, lamented US educational performance and cost.\n\n\u201cWe spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, and we\u2019re ranked at the bottom of the list,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wants to \u201clet the states run schools.\u201d\n\nBut even if he succeeded in ending the department, it\u2019s possible that some programs and funding could be retained and shifted to other agencies, \ufeffwhich is where they were housed before the department was created in 1979.\n\nFederal funding programs for K-12 schools that help support the education of students from low-income families and children with disabilities, for example, predated the creation of the Department of Education.\n\nWhen presidents have proposed cuts to the department\u2019s budget in the past, Congress has resisted and appropriated more funding than what the president asked for about 71% of the time, according to an analysis from the Brookings Institution. Even when the first Trump administration proposed cutting the department\u2019s budget, the Republican-controlled Congress ultimately increased funding.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS Agency for International Development staff around the world will be placed on administrative leave Friday and ordered to return to the US, according to a directive issued Tuesday night.\n\nAs of 11:59 p.m. ET Friday, \u201call USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs,\u201d said a statement posted on the USAID website, which is back online after going dark last week.\n\nThe statement said it is preparing a plan for personnel posted outside the United States \u201cunder which the Agency would arrange and pay for return travel to the United States within 30 days\u201d and terminate \u201ccontracts that are not determined to be essential.\u201d\n\nAs the name implies, a direct hire is a government official directly employed by the US government, as opposed to contractors, who make up a large part of the USAID workforce. Many of those contractors have already been furloughed or laid off. Essential personnel expected to continue working will be informed by Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe statement on the website ends with: \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d\n\nThe directive comes as the Trump administration has begun dismantling the agency and frozen almost all foreign aid. A day earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would be acting administrator of USAID, confirming the de-facto takeover of the humanitarian agency by the State Department.\n\nIn recent days, dozens of senior USAID officials have been placed on leave, thousands of contractors have been laid off, and employees were told this week not to report to the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters.\n\nCNN reported earlier that staffers were receiving individual emails Tuesday informing them that they were being put on leave. Multiple officials shared with CNN the notice from the acting deputy administrator, Peter Marocco.\n\n\u201cYou will remain on administrative leave with pay until otherwise notified,\u201d the notice states.\n\n\u201cDuring the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter USAID premises, access USAID systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with USAID in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,\u201d Marocco says in the letter.\n\nWhen a reporter told President Donald Trump on Tuesday that it sounded like he was going to \u201cwind down\u201d the agency, he laughed and said, \u201cSounds like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at all the fraud that he\u2019s found in this USAID,\u201d the president said of Elon Musk, the tech billionaire leading the Department of Governmental Efficiency. \u201cIt has to be corrupt,\u201d Trump added without evidence.\n\nMarocco\u2019s Tuesday letter instructed employees to email a USAID official with their \u201cpersonal contact information, including your phone number, email and mailing address,\u201d so they can remain available during regular business hours. A USAID employee told CNN they emailed and got a bounceback, saying that person is also on leave.\n\n\u201cPeople are hysterical. My friends are crying. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said one USAID official put on leave. They noted that officials posted abroad may have children in school or spouses with jobs, and now that is \u201call uprooted.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo access to any government system; can\u2019t see emails. It\u2019s like we\u2019re criminals,\u201d the official said.\n\nOn Monday, thousands of personal services contractors and civil servants lost access to email and USAID systems overnight. The sudden chaos has left employees struggling to get any answers, officials said.\n\nAdditionally, USAID headquarters and annex offices in the Washington, DC, area will remain closed the remainder of the week, according to an email sent to staff Tuesday and obtained by CNN. The offices closed include the headquarters in Washington; a second DC annex location; an office in Leesburg, Virginia; and one in Springfield, Virginia.\n\n\u201cAgency personnel normally assigned to work at these USAID properties should telework this week,\u201d the email said.\n\nThere are some exceptions for personnel with essential on-site and building maintenance functions, the email said. The email noted employees are still \u201cexpected to remain available during regular business hours and operations.\u201d\n\nShortly after being sworn in last month, Trump issued a sweeping executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, leading to widespread confusion, layoffs and program shutdowns.\n\nUSAID was established in 1961 under President John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration and is the US government\u2019s humanitarian arm. It dispenses billions of dollars annually across the world in an effort to alleviate poverty, treat diseases, and respond to famines and natural disasters.\n\nMusk has led the Trump administration\u2019s effort to weaken USAID, falsely calling it a \u201cviper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America\u201d and branding it a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that should \u201cdie.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s actions have raised questions from Democrats over the legality of any wind-down of the agency that will likely have a dramatic consequence for global life-saving aid from the United States.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report.",

It was a trip that Dale had done before when his kids were little, and everyone was looking forward to reliving fond family memories.\n\nThey\u2019ve now scrapped all those travel plans.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected president, the group of 11 decided to take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. But the US president\u2019s threat to impose punishing tariffs and to annex Canada, along with his trolling of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who Trump called \u201cGovernor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada,\u201d were the last straw.\n\n\u201cThe rhetoric about tariffs, the mockery of our prime minister and the musing about us becoming the 51st state, that did it for all of us,\u201d Dale told CNN Travel. \u201cEveryone was in agreement that we\u2019re not going. We\u2019re going to keep our money in our own country.\u201d\n\nDale is part of a growing chorus of angry Canadians who have become vocal about boycotting travel to the US over the next four years. People on both sides of the border are already reporting travel-related fallout, with anxiety running both ways.\n\nOn social media, the discourse among many Canadians is a mix of worry, fear, outrage and disappointment. While some vow not to step foot in the US while Trump is in office, others say they are torn, as they have upcoming family or professional commitments.\n\nPosts on social media suggest some Canadian snowbirds who usually escape Canadian winters in states like Florida or Arizona now say they are choosing to winter at home or are making a permanent move back north.\n\nSome pledge to only visit Democrat-leaning states like California and New York. Others say they will continue to visit but spend at Black, Latino, POC and LGBTQ+-owned businesses and support marginalized groups perceived to have a target on their back under the Trump administration.\n\n\u2018Choose Canada\u2019\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called on his country's citizens to avoid purchasing some American products. Justin Tang/The Canadian Press/AP\n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced significant new tariffs on Canada that were due to go into effect on February 4 but were paused for one month after last-minute talks between the US president and Trudeau. Mexico and China were also targeted with new tariffs.\n\nIn a solemn 13-minute speech Saturday, Trudeau appealed to Canadians to do their part and to \u201cchoose Canada.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many ways for you to do your part,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might mean checking the labels at the supermarket and picking Canadian-made products. It might mean opting for Canadian rye over Kentucky bourbon or forgoing Florida orange juice altogether. It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada and explore the many national and provincial parks, historical sites and tourist destinations our great country has to offer.\u201d\n\nDale, a 52-year-old high school teacher, had budgeted spending around $5,000 CAD (about $3,430 USD) on his family\u2019s Tennessee vacation. The other two families included a family of four and a single mother and her child.\n\nCanada is the largest source of international visitors to the US. According to the US Travel Association, 20.4 million Canadians visited the country last year, generating $20.5 billion USD in spending. Just a 10% reduction in Canadian travel would result in $2.1 billion USD in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, the group warned in a press release.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from Statistics Canada, Canadians also pumped $6.5 billion CAD (about $4.5 billion USD) into the US economy in the second quarter of 2024 alone, spending an average of $1,001 CAD per trip (about $685 USD), with the bulk of their spending going towards accommodations, restaurants and bars. They stayed for an average of four nights.\n\nThe top most visited states among Canadian visitors are Florida, California, Nevada, New York and Texas.\n\nKristine Geary, founder of the motor coach tour company Maple Leaf Tours in Kingston, Ontario, said her business has already taken a 30% hit in cancellations for her US packages this year, which include destinations like Nashville, Washington and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The morning Geary spoke to CNN, a couple had canceled their booking for Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cMany of our clients are reluctantly canceling their tours to the US with disappointment because they\u2019re putting their long-anticipated plans on hold,\u201d Geary said. \u201cThe hesitation and unpredictability surrounding what\u2019s happening and travel to the US have created challenges, and it\u2019s difficult for me to maintain stability and growth.\u201d\n\nAcross the border, New Jersey resident Monica Church is also starting to feel the effects of the trade war. Soon after Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs, Church received a contrite message from a Canadian couple who canceled their month-long stay at her vacation rental in North Myrtle Beach over the weekend. In their message, they cited the trade war as the reason for their cancellation.\n\nFar from being upset at the $2,000 USD loss, Church said she understood and was impressed by the couple\u2019s commitment to cancel their holiday in the name of Canadian solidarity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little jealous of that feeling, where you feel for your country so much that you band together,\u201d Church told CNN Travel. \u201cKind of like how everyone felt after 9/11, you felt proud to be American. I haven\u2019t felt proud to be an American lately.\u201d\n\n\u2018Am I now a walking target?\u2019\n\nJason Dale and his family, seen here during a 2022 Disney World visit, had been planning to visit Tennessee this year. Jason Dale\n\nWhile gun violence has always been a concern for Canadian travelers, Trump\u2019s crackdown on the trans and immigrant communities has also raised more alarm bells around safety for some would-be visitors. When his middle son expressed anxiety about traveling to the US with his two gay dads, Dale said he knew they couldn\u2019t go through with the trip.\n\n\u201cThat just did it for me,\u201d he said.\n\nColleen Whale, 41, from Barrie, Ontario, also mused aloud that in a climate of political upheaval, nothing is certain.\n\n\u201cI have a rainbow on my fanny pack, so am I now a walking target? I\u2019m not part of the LGBTQ+ community but I\u2019m an ally.\u201d\n\nAfter retaliatory tariffs from Canada, it could be gloves off for some Americans, she added.\n\n\u201cIf I show my Canadianism just by the way I speak, is that going to put a target on my back?\u201d\n\nBut the fear and anxiety run both ways. Church, who had been discussing a road trip to Montreal and Quebec with her husband this year, also wonders if their American license plate could make them targets in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of nervous if Canadians are going to be upset with Americans.\u201d\n\nWhale had not entertained these questions when she traveled to Nashville in 2023 with her mom for CMA Fest, a country music festival. They had enjoyed themselves so much that she promised to take her mother again in 2026 to celebrate her 75th birthday.\n\nBut the more she watched the news, Whale said she realized she couldn\u2019t go through with it.\n\nWith a heavy heart, she went to her mother\u2019s house to announce her decision, breaking down in tears. Her mother, too, broke down, agreeing it was for the best.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to disappoint her,\u201d Whale said. \u201cAnd all of the feelings of the heaviness of the world, it just got to me. It got to both of us.\u201d\n\nWedding photographer Tamara Boden, 41, pointed out that while it\u2019s \u201cnot Trump\u2019s first rodeo,\u201d his second presidency is markedly different for Canadians.\n\n\u201cFor me, as a Canadian, these threatening talks of making Canada the 51st state are alarming and enraging,\u201d Boden said from her home in Trail, British Columbia. \u201cThat\u2019s different this time around. There\u2019s very real talk about a war on women and a war on minorities. It feels scary as someone with a uterus to go into the States.\u201d\n\nBoden lives 10 miles from the US border. Like many of her neighbors, a typical weekend might involve piling the kids in the car, driving across the border to grab lunch at a good Mexican restaurant, and shopping at stores like Trader Joe\u2019s and Target that aren\u2019t available in Canada.\n\nThat won\u2019t be happening again soon, she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be how I spend my Saturday for sure. Not for the next four years at least.\u201d\n\nMoral imperative\n\nPeople wait in an airport at a departure lounge. simonkr/E+/Getty Images\n\nIn a recent survey published by travel management company Corporate Traveller Canada, 85% of the 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprises polled said they anticipate reducing their cross-border travel if tariffs are imposed.\n\nChris Lynes, managing director for Flight Centre Travel Group Canada, which includes Corporate Traveller, said though the company hadn\u2019t seen mass cancellations for travel to the US so far, the new tariffs and the plummeting value of the Canadian dollar are expected to have significant repercussions for travel across the border.\n\n\u201cIf we are hit with broad tariffs, we will see quite the slowdown in travel, especially to the US,\u201d Lynes said, adding that affordability is the main driver of travel behavior.\n\nThe Canadian dollar tumbled to a 22-year-low amid tariff uncertainty but rebounded Monday amid speculation about the reprieve.\n\nBut Canadians like Boden say the decision to boycott travel to the US is driven first by a moral imperative, and less a financial one.\n\nFor their upcoming family trip to Mexico, Boden said they will forgo their usual strategy of crossing the border and flying out of a US airport, which is much cheaper, and pony up the extra $200 CAD to fly out of Vancouver. Because money talks, she said, and the turn of events in the US made her realize she\u2019d rather support the local Canadian economy over the US.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of sticking it to the Americans, because I do believe that the average American is good-hearted. But unfortunately, the person running their country is unhinged at the moment.\u201d",

The station said it provides education to Afghan girls and support to Afghan women, without being \u201cinvolved in any political activity whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIts sister channels also offer lessons online filmed in studios thousands of miles away in Paris. The televised classes cover a wider array of subjects, providing education in a country where girls are banned from school after sixth grade.\n\nTightening the grip\n\nThe Taliban, a radical Islamist group not recognized by most countries around the world, has been tightening its grip on the media landscape since its takeover more than three years ago.\n\nInitially presenting itself as more moderate than during its previous rule of Afghanistan in the 1990s, it even promised that women would be allowed to continue their education up to university.\n\nBut it has since cracked down instead, closing secondary schools for girls; banning women from attending university, working in most sectors and at NGOs, including the United Nations; restricting their travel without a male chaperone; and banning them from public spaces such as parks and gyms.\n\nLast year, the Taliban closed at least 12 media outlets, both public and private, according to RSF, which ranked Afghanistan 178 out of 180 countries in its latest press freedom index.\n\nThe Islamist regime also banned the sound of women\u2019s voices in public \u2013 including singing, reciting, or reading aloud \u2013 under a strict set of \u201cvice and virtue\u201d laws that made it even harder for Radio Begum to reach its female audience.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIn the days following the collision of a military helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington, DC, and the crash of a medevac jet in Philadelphia, federal investigators quickly expressed condolences to the families of the victims and partnered with non-profit groups to provide information and support.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\nAs aviation authorities and transportation safety teams focused on recovering the wreckage and piecing together what might have caused the accidents, the families of the victims were often left frustrated by a lack of information and the slow pace of the investigations, which can often take a year.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, an airliner exploded shortly after departing New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, leaving authorities with a difficult and complex investigation and families demanding answers.\n\nFrom the tragedy and the tireless efforts of advocates, an act of Congress mandated the government to offer support to families following airline disasters.\n\nTWA Flight 800\n\nTWA Flight 800 \u2014 A section of the wing of TWA Flight 800, seen here a couple of days after the crash, floats in the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island, New York.

Sylwia Kapuscinski/Getty Images/FILE Photos: TWA Flight 800 Prev Next\n\nIn 1996, Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 was carrying 230 people when it exploded minutes after taking off, killing everyone on board. The plane\u2019s wreckage fell into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island. With help from the US Navy, the US Coast Guard and contracted fishing trawlers scouring the ocean floor, investigators were able to recover more than 95% of the aircraft, and, after almost a year, the remains of all who died were also recovered.\n\nThe tragedy prompted one of the largest and most expensive aviation investigations in history and set off a flurry of conspiracy theories, though the NTSB eventually deemed it an accident and found no evidence of foul play.\n\nFollowing the 1996 TWA Flight 800 explosion and an exhaustive four-year investigation, Frank Hilldrup, an NTSB official who was on the original team of Flight 800 investigators, and his team determined the probable cause of the explosion was an electrical short, which detonated vapors in the center wing fuel tank, though they never definitively determined where the initial spark came from.\n\nThe family members of the Flight 800 tragedy reportedly struggled to get information from officials, while others seemingly understood the intricacy of the crash.\n\n\u201cWe saw an enormous, tremendous amount of destruction,\u201d Jose Cremades, a family member of one of the victims, said in 1997 while viewing the reconstructed wreckage from the airliner. \u201cThe plane is really in small pieces, and we have understood today the complexity and the enormity of the task that both the FBI and the NTSB are facing. And I think they\u2019re doing a wonderful job.\u201d\n\nSupport for families\n\nThe explosion led to legislation, the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act, which would forever change the way plane accident victims\u2019 families and loved ones are treated.\n\n\u201cThe Act requires air carriers to develop and maintain plans that address the needs of families of passengers involved in aircraft accidents,\u201d according to a document from the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThe law also requires that at a minimum the air carrier\u2019s plan should include the eighteen assurances outlined in the legislation.\u201d\n\nUnder the act, the NTSB \u201cis responsible for coordinating federal government resources to support local, state, and tribal governments, disaster relief organizations, and the air carrier to meet the needs of families.\u201d\n\nPeter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told CNN in 2000 the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act was created when it \u201cbecame clear to the NTSB and to the Congress and to others that families deserved more information and more targeted care after these kinds of disasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when a disaster happens, family members get information from the government first, before the media. They are briefed on a regular basis. And what we\u2019re trying to do is not compound the tragedy,\u201d Goelz said.\n\nFollowing the collision in Washington, DC, the law was put into action by the NTSB.\n\nTodd Inman with the agency on Friday said, \u201cWe did family briefings last night and today, there are over 100 family members that are now in the area receiving briefings. And it\u2019s part of the legislative requirement receiving Family Assistance.\u201d\n\nInman said the families have been briefed by the medical examiner, fire chief, NTSB chairman and family assistant unit from the airline.\n\nAmerican Airlines said its CARE Team arrived at the scene before sunrise Thursday. According to the company, the CARE team is a specially trained group that compassionately supports family members of the passengers and crew members in the aftermath of the accident.\n\n\u201cAmerican has so far deployed 175 CARE Team members to Washington, D.C. and Wichita, Kansas. All CARE Team members have been assigned to the families,\u201d Andrea Koos, with American Airlines, said.\n\nThe CARE team, who are available 24/7 for families, also coordinates travel arrangements for family members and helps with accommodations for child care, elder care and pet care, the company said Saturday.\n\nThe legislation also tasks the NTSB with designating an \u201can independent nonprofit organization,\u201d such as the American Red Cross, to coordinate \u201cthe emotional care, psychological care, and family support services\u201d of those hurt in an accident or the family members of those hurt in an accident.\n\nSearching for answers\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who\u2019s been a vocal critic of congestion at Reagan National Airport, warning it was only a matter of time before there was a deadly collision, said he believes the NTSB will determine what led to Wednesday\u2019s incident.\n\n\u201cI do believe the NTSB will get to the bottom of it. I have a feeling I know some of the things they will find. I\u2019m confident that they\u2019ll give us answers, and then that Congress and the administration together have to provide solutions following their recommendations,\u201d Kaine told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as the NTSB works to issue a preliminary report on the cause of the collision within 30 days, family members are dealing with their loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so in shock right now,\u201d Andy Beyer, whose daughter and wife were among the victims, told CNN. \u201cAnd there\u2019s like a place in my mind that I can\u2019t get near with all of the pain and grief. It\u2019s like the door in my house to my daughter\u2019s room. I just can\u2019t go anywhere near it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Pete Muntean, Chris Boyette, Jessica Coacci, Taylor Galgano and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu couldn\u2019t keep the smirk off his face.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nNetanyahu looked on in the White House on Tuesday as President Donald Trump delivered the most stunning US intervention in the long history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe president repeatedly doubled down on his suggestion that nearly 2 million Palestinians should be relocated from battle-leveled Gaza to new homes elsewhere so that the US could send troops to the Strip, take ownership and build the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou build really good quality housing, like a beautiful town, like some place where they can live and not die, because Gaza is a guarantee that they\u2019re going to end up dying,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nIn a few words, Trump conjured up a mind-boggling geopolitical transformation of the Middle East and a political lifeline for Netanyahu \u2013 showing why the prime minister, despite their past tensions, was rooting for his host\u2019s return to power in the 2024 election.\n\nNetanyahu can now bill himself to right-wing factions in his coalition, which incessantly threaten his grip on power, as the unique and vital conduit to Trump. The American president\u2019s views now parallel Israeli hardliners\u2019 desire to see Palestinians ousted from part of what they view as the sacred land of Israel.\n\nIsrael\u2019s far-right former national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who quit Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet earlier this year to protest the Gaza ceasefire deal, confirmed the synergy between Trump\u2019s thinking and extreme conservatives in Israel.\n\n\u201cDonald, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\n\nA stunning moment\n\nTrump\u2019s comments \u2013 delivered throughout the day, first at an executive action signing ceremony, and later alongside Netanyahu in the Oval Office and at a joint news conference \u2013 were a landmark moment in the history of US peacemaking in the Middle East.\n\nTo see an American president endorse what would be the forcible expulsion of Palestinians from their home, in an exodus that would subvert decades of US policy, international law and basic humanity, was breathtaking.\n\nTrump followed up with the most imperialist reflex yet of a second term in which he\u2019s already threatened to annex the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada. He envisaged a real estate deal whereby he\u2019d assume responsibility for Gaza and mastermind a job-creating urban regeneration project. He called it an American \u201cownership position.\u201d A better phrase would be colonialism for the 21st century.\n\n\u201cThe US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site. Level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area, do a real job, do something different.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hold a joint press conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington, DC, February 4, 2025. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nThe idea resembles a scheme proposed by Trump\u2019s investor son-in-law Jared Kushner last year to move the Palestinians out of Gaza and to \u201cclean it up\u201d to develop the territory\u2019s \u201cvery valuable\u201d Mediterranean waterfront.\n\nBut it appears absurd for multiple reasons.\n\nIf the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy led such a forced relocation, he\u2019d mirror crimes of past tyrants and create an excuse for every autocrat to launch mass ethnic cleansing programs against vulnerable minorities.\n\nHis brainwave, however, is on brand for a second Trump term that has seen the president utterly unconstrained by the law, the Constitution or anyone around him stopping him from doing exactly as he wants.\n\nAnd in all of Trump\u2019s recent public pronouncements on Gaza, there\u2019s an important missing element \u2014 any sense that the Palestinian people would have a choice in their own destiny. Their connection with the desecrated enclave was recently underscored by the return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Northern Gaza. Many made makeshift shelters in the ruins of their homes destroyed in Israeli\u2019s onslaught against Hamas after the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel.\n\nThe president\u2019s obliviousness to the aspirations of Palestinians and his assumption that they\u2019d prefer a modern housing development elsewhere showed a stunning naivety about the causes of the conflict. But it was reflected in an interaction in the Oval Office when he asked, \u201cWhy would they want to return? The place has been hell.\u201d A reporter replied: \u201cBut it\u2019s their home, sir. Why would they leave?\u201d\n\nAn Arab official told CNN\u2019s Alex Marquardt that Trump\u2019s remarks could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. \u201cIt is essential to recognize the profound implications such proposals have on the lives and dignity of the Palestinian people, as well as the broader Middle East,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nA regional no-go\n\nThere are also practical reasons why this idea is a fantasy. It is vehemently opposed by the Arab states whose money and land would be needed to make it work. Jordan, which is already home to large numbers of Palestinian refugees, fears the Hashemite Kingdom would be fatally destabilized by a new influx. Egypt\u2019s military fears a massive influx of Palestinians that could include Hamas sympathizers of the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nSpeaking of the two Israeli neighbors, Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator, said on CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s not a real estate deal for them, it\u2019s not even a humanitarian issue for them. It\u2019s an existential issue.\u201d\n\nThe idea of forcibly relocating the Palestinians would also be politically impossible for Saudi Arabia, the key piece in Trump\u2019s plan to create an anti-Iran crescent capped by a diplomatic normalization with Israel. The kingdom has made an independent Palestinian state a condition of such a deal.\n\nThe total evacuation of Gaza would deal a serious blow to statehood dreams and create a precedent that could also raise doubt about the Palestinian presence in the West Bank \u2013 which is considered by the United Nations, like Gaza, as Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nThe idea of large numbers of Palestinians agreeing to quit Gaza for a suburban idyll elsewhere also relies on a superficial understanding of a conflict that left them dispossessed. Ever since the founding of Israel in 1948, the hopes of a return for thousands of Palestinians living in poverty in refugee camps, in places like Beirut and Jordan, have proven futile. Thus, Gazans would never leave based on promises that one day they might get back.\n\nThe idea that Trump would even broach such a scheme is an indication of how the post-October 7 era has shaken up the strategic picture in the Middle East. But it also displays remarkable hubris since recent attempts by the United States to reshape the geopolitics of the Middle East \u2014 from Iraq to Libya \u2014 ended disastrously. And across a wider historic span, efforts by European colonial powers like Britain and France to draw borders and impose grand schemes on the Middle East bequeathed generations of bitter conflicts that still rage.\n\nIs Trump for real?\n\nTrump\u2019s comments will unleash yet another round of speculation about whether he\u2019s serious about an outlandish plan, or whether he\u2019s using it to distract from some other even more nefarious scheme \u2014 perhaps the broadening effort by his friend Elon Musk to destroy the US government from inside.\n\nBut it\u2019s also characteristic of an outsider president who lives to shake things up and who is beloved by his voters for rejecting the orthodoxy of elites and the conventional approaches that have failed.\n\nEstablishment and media critics often bristle at his out-of-the-box ideas because they don\u2019t fit their frame of reference. And if only Gaza could somehow be lifted clear of the generations of bloody history, symbolism, loss and wars that have raged over the enclave.\n\nThat, of course, is impossible.\n\nSo is Trump for real \u2014 or is this just another pipe dream of a president who often seems divorced from reality?\n\nTrump\u2019s plan was greeted with huge skepticism by Republican senators. And Democratic Sen. Chris Coons put his face in his hand and rubbed his temples. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. That\u2019s insane,\u201d the man from Delaware said.\n\nIn his own way, Trump does seem sincere about improving the lives of Gazans, even if his preferred remedy insults their identity. He said: \u201cThe people that have been absolutely destroyed that live there now can live in peace, in a much better situation, because they\u2019re living in hell, and those people will now be able to live in peace. We\u2019ll make sure that it\u2019s done world class.\u201d\n\nHe told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins at the news conference that Palestinians had tried to live in Gaza \u201cfor decades and decades and decades. It\u2019s not going to work. It didn\u2019t work. It will never work. And you have to learn from history.\u201d (Most of those decades were spent either under Israeli occupation or blockade, most recently with Gaza run by Hamas, a terror group that disputes Israel\u2019s right to exist).\n\nTrump\u2019s words often need several pinches of salt.\n\nLike a former New York real estate shark, he adopts an outlandish initial position to put interlocutors off balance or as an opening bid that raises the value of a compromise position. He\u2019s always in search of a deal \u2014 and sees conflicts like the ones in the Middle East and Ukraine through a developer\u2019s lens.\n\nBeth Sanner, a former senior intelligence official who conducted Trump\u2019s daily intelligence briefing during his first term, said Tuesday\u2019s staggering developments were a reminder that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t think like a typical foreign policy establishment person.\u201d\n\nThat may not be all bad, given the questionable outcomes of US foreign policy in recent times. But Trump is also courting risk. His comments on Tuesday will cause shockwaves throughout the Middle East and make it much harder for Arab governments to work with him to expand the Abraham Accords of his first term.\n\n\u201cIt runs counter to the Muslim Street in the region,\u201d Sanner said. \u201cThat\u2019s sometimes different to what leaders think. But the leaders in the region are afraid of the Muslim Street.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that Trump would send troops to the region also conflicts with the political DNA of a president who partly owes his rise to a political base wearied by sending its sons and daughters to war in the post-9/11 era.\n\nBut while his proposal, which would perhaps be the world\u2019s largest ever real estate development deal, is unlikely to ever happen, it\u2019s quintessential Trump.\n\n\u201cYou say things others refuse to say,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cAnd after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, \u2018You know, he\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first sentence is undoubtably true. The second one, not so much.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency on Tuesday became the first major national security agency to offer so-called buyouts to its entire workforce, a CIA spokesperson and two other sources familiar with the offer said, part of President Donald Trump\u2019s broad effort to shrink the federal government and shape it to his agenda.\n\nThe offer \u2014 which tells federal employees that they can quit their jobs and receive roughly eight months of pay and benefits \u2014 had up until Tuesday not been made available to most national security roles in an apparent cognizance of their critical function to the security of the nation.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe personally decided he also wanted the CIA to be involved, one of the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the move is part of Ratcliffe\u2019s efforts to \u201censure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration\u2019s national security priorities,\u201d adding that is \u201cpart of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy.\u201d\n\nStill, even as the offer was sent to the entire workforce at the agency, it was not immediately clear whether all would be allowed to take it. Some specific occupations and areas of expertise appear likely to be restricted, one of the sources familiar with the offer said, suggesting that the effort is far less sweeping than in civil service agencies that are not considered to be doing national security work. There\u2019s also a caveat for Ratcliffe to retain flexibility to work through the timing of officer departures in critical areas, according to another source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management had issued internal guidance last week that some officers at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence may be able to participate in the program but that not all positions at the ODNI will necessarily be eligible, according to two other sources familiar with the communications.\n\nThe decision to include the CIA in the program appears to be a recent one: As of last week, the CIA workforce was still being advised that officials were trying to determine whether they would be eligible for the program, one of those sources said.\n\nThe broad CIA offer was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed at different points that intelligence officers at the CIA have been part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d determined to undermine him, and some critics have described the deferred resignation program as a purge \u2013 something Trump officials have denied.\n\nSome national security officials in Trump\u2019s orbit believe that the CIA in recent years has become too heavily weighted towards analysis at the expense of clandestinely collecting intelligence and carrying out covert operations \u2013 functions of the agency\u2019s much smaller Directorate of Operations.\n\nRatcliffe during his confirmation hearing vowed to reinvest in both.\n\n\u201cTo the brave CIA officers listening all around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s time to find a new line of work.\u201d\n\nThe deferred resignation program has caused an uproar across government. The controversial offer, which unions have urged members not to accept, was unveiled in a mass email from the OPM to federal employees on January 28.\n\nThe Trump administration is now planning widespread layoffs among the federal workforce soon, leaving employees across the government who don\u2019t accept the deferred resignation offer at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nThe layoffs, which are being referred to internally as sweeping \u201cReductions in Force,\u201d are expected to begin soon after the Thursday deadline that the Office of Personnel Management set for workers to accept the resignation package, officials said.\n\nThe package allows them to leave voluntarily and be paid through September 30 but not have to continue working. It was not clear whether those same terms applied to the offer sent to the CIA workforce.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States \u201cwill take over\u201d the Gaza Strip \u2014 possibly with the help of American troops \u2014 while the Palestinians who live there should leave, a stunning proposal that would dramatically reorient the Middle East and subject a population of more than a million to further displacement.\n\n\u201cThe US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,\u201d Trump said during a joint press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, later describing his vision for the area as a new \u201cRiviera.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether he was willing to send US troops to fill a security vacuum in Gaza, Trump did not rule it out.\n\n\u201cAs far as Gaza is concerned, we\u2019ll do what is necessary. If it\u2019s necessary, we\u2019ll do that. We\u2019re going to take over that piece that we\u2019re going to develop it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments are a remarkable assertion from a sitting American president, particularly one who rose to political power in the United States through his criticism of America\u2019s longest wars in the Middle East and pledges to return US investments back to its citizens. They open a host of questions about how Trump\u2019s land-grab would proceed, what its legal authorities would be and who would pay for the effort.\n\n\u201cI do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\u201d Trump told reporters in the East Room of the White House. He said later: \u201cThis was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I\u2019ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.\u201d\n\nThere will be many in the region who oppose Trump\u2019s plan, despite his claim that all of his interlocutors love it. Already, Egypt and Jordan have rejected the notion of accepting additional Palestinian refugees, wary of destabilization and fearful they will never be allowed back home.\n\nTrump suggested that was exactly what he envisioned: a future in Gaza that largely does not involve Palestinians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people should be going back to Gaza,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office earlier in the day. \u201cI heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They live like hell. They live like they\u2019re living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative.\u201d\n\nLater, he added that Palestinians could be among those who return to Gaza, but he was clear he did not envision the strip as a permanent home for them.\n\n\u201cPalestinians also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, a former real estate developer, said during his press conference that he had studied the matter \u201cclosely, over a lot of months.\u201d\n\nThose comments followed his suggestion earlier in the day that Gazans move to a new location provided by one or more nations in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cI mean they\u2019re there because they have no alternative. What do they have? It is a big pile of rubble right now,\u201d Trump said moments before hosting Netanyahu for Oval Office talks.\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion that Gazans leave the strip permanently amounts to a provocative stance that will endear him to Israel\u2019s most conservative politicians but is generally a non-starter for Israel\u2019s neighbors, who have said they are unwilling to accept new Palestinian refugees from the enclave.\n\nAt first on Tuesday, Trump framed the matter as a humanitarian one, saying it was impossible to believe anyone would want to remain in the war-torn territory.\n\n\u201cWhy would they want to return? The place has been hell,\u201d Trump said, ignoring a reporter who cried out: \u201cBecause it\u2019s their home.\u201d\n\nInstead of Gaza, he suggested the Palestinians be provided a \u201cgood, fresh, beautiful piece of land\u201d to live.\n\nNetanyahu, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, smiled as Trump was speaking. The Israeli leader, under conflicting pressures domestically, was in Washington to ascertain exactly where Trump stands on the next phase of a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s dim views of Gaza as a permanent home for Palestinians was certain to provide grist for far-right allies of the Israeli leader, who have called on Netanyahu to abandon the temporary truce that was struck last month.\n\nA family rides in a horse-drawn cart past a destroyed mosque in Beit Lahia, Gaza, on January 29. Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n\n\u2018Hard to grasp and digest\u2019\n\nTwo Arab officials expressed puzzlement, concern and pessimism in the immediate wake of Trump\u2019s unexpected remarks.\n\nIt was \u201crough, raw, hard to grasp and digest,\u201d one official said, adding that they \u201cneed clarity and further development to become understood.\u201d\n\nA second official said the comments could jeopardize the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza, stressing the \u201cprofound implications such proposals have on the lives and dignity of the Palestinian people, as well as the broader Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality remains that 1.8 million people in Gaza would resist such an initiative and refuse to leave,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cSaudi Arabia is unlikely to pursue peace under these circumstances, and other nations may reconsider their commitments to the Abraham Accords.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments, meanwhile, drew skepticism from congressional lawmakers, including from some within his own party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what our Arab friends say about that. I think most South Carolinians would probably not be excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza,\u201d said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. \u201cI think that might be problematic. But I\u2019ll keep an open mind.\u201d\n\nThe American president\u2019s proclamation laying claim to Gaza as US territory did not appear likely to convince Hamas to return immediately to the negotiating table.\n\nTrump said he was still determined to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get all of the hostages, and if we don\u2019t, it will just make us somewhat more violent,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has claimed credit for the hostages-for-ceasefire agreement struck in the days before he entered office \u2013 and even officials in the outgoing Biden administration acknowledged Trump\u2019s imminent arrival helped apply pressure on Israel and Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu, perhaps seeking to ingratiate himself with his host, praised Trump\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cI think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\u201d Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nBut for all of his prodding to get the deal inked, Trump will still need to oversee the remaining two phases of the three-phase plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019re dealing with very complicated people, but a deal can absolutely get done,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was plenty for Trump and Netanyahu to discuss beyond the immediate matter of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nThere is the prospect of a broader normalization of relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, that former President Joe Biden had been pursuing before the October 7, 2023, attacks. Trump, who openly pines for a Nobel Peace Prize, may see his opportunity in such a pursuit, which could transform the entire Middle East and create a new bulwark against Iran, a common foe to Jerusalem and Riyadh.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear his comments Tuesday will be helpful. In a statement on X following Trump\u2019s remarks, the Saudi Foreign Ministry restated its long-held position that it will not commit to normalization of relations with Israel without guarantees of a Palestinian state.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPeople wave Israeli national flags as a military helicopter transporting four newly-released Israeli hostages lands at the Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva, Israel, on January 25. Yossi Zamir/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA complicated relationship\n\nWhether Netanyahu is interested in diplomacy \u2013 or whether he instead sees Trump\u2019s arrival in Washington as a moment to take decisive action against Iran, potentially even taking out its nuclear program \u2013 remains to be seen.\n\nAhead off his arrival, there was speculation Netanyahu could use the talks to take Trump\u2019s temperature on a direct strike, seizing a moment when Iranian proxies have been decimated, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions appear to be accelerating and while he has friendlier ties to Washington.\n\nBefore Netanyahu arrived, Trump signed a directive authorizing a tough approach to Iran meant to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon while warning of \u201cobliteration\u201d should he be assassinated by Tehran\u2019s operatives.\n\nTrump said he\u2019d left directions for his team on how to respond should he fall prey to an Iranian assassination plot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve left instructions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they do it, they\u2019ll be obliterated.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s visit lasted several hours and included the joint press conference, all meant to demonstrate Trump\u2019s solidarity with Israel.\n\nBut the comity between the men belied a relationship that\u2019s more complicated than it sometimes appears \u2013 with nothing less than the future of the Middle East potentially riding on Trump\u2019s words.\n\nIn the lead-up to last November\u2019s election, there was little question among Biden\u2019s team that Netanyahu favored a Trump victory, believing he would enjoy a far wider remit from the American government to prosecute his war aims with Trump in office instead of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThose predictions have not been wrong.\n\nAlready, Trump has lifted a hold on heavy bomb deliveries to Israel, rolling back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel amid its war in Gaza.\n\nBut while Trump is popular in Israel, and Netanyahu enthusiastically welcomed his return to the White House, things haven\u2019t always been so cheerful.\n\nWhen Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his election victory in 2020, Trump was enraged at what he saw as betrayal. In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to the esteemed Israeli reporter Barak Ravid, now a CNN analyst: \u201cF**k him.\u201d\n\nEven three years later, after Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack in Israel\u2019s history, it was clear Trump\u2019s sore feelings hadn\u2019t entirely faded.\n\n\u201c(Netanyahu) was not prepared. He was not prepared, and Israel was not prepared,\u201d Trump said in an interview shortly after the attacks, comments that drew condemnation even from Republicans.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks Tuesday, delivered next to Netanyahu, suggest the animosity has been forgotten.\n\nThe prime minister is planning to remain in Washington well beyond his Tuesday talks with Trump. He arrived to Blair House, the presidential guest residence, late Sunday and is expected to stay until the end of the week, including for meetings on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alex Marquardt, Kaitlan Collins, Zeena Saifi, Lucas Lilieholm and Irene Nasser contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Trump administration is planning widespread layoffs among the federal workforce soon, leaving employees who don\u2019t accept its deferred resignation offer at risk of losing their jobs, two Trump administration officials told CNN.\n\nThe layoffs, which are being referred to internally as sweeping \u201cReductions in Force,\u201d are expected to begin soon after the Thursday deadline that the Office of Personnel Management set for workers to accept the resignation package, the officials said.\n\nThe package allows them to leave voluntarily and be paid through September 30 but not have to continue working.\n\nFederal workers unions, however, have strongly opposed the controversial offer, which was unveiled in a mass email from the OPM to federal employees on January 28.\n\nOn Tuesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and several other unions filed a lawsuit in US District Court in Massachusetts seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the February 6 deadline. The unions also want to \u201crequire the government to articulate a policy that is lawful, rather than an arbitrary, unlawful, short-fused ultimatum which workers may not be able to enforce.\u201d\n\nMore than 20,000 staffers have agreed to the deferred resignation offer, one of the administration officials said.\n\nThat number is \u201crapidly growing,\u201d according to the official, who noted that the 20,000 figure isn\u2019t current.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting the largest spike to come 24-48 hours before the deadline,\u201d the official told CNN.\n\nThe 20,000 figure represents about 1% of the roughly 2 million federal employees who received the offer. The White House has said its target is for between 5% and 10% of employees to resign.\n\nHowever, OPM is continuing to warn employees that those who do not opt in to the program could lose their jobs and, at the very least, will be required to return full time to the office. One of the Trump administration officials described the deferred resignation program as a \u201cgenerous, voluntary option\u201d for workers who could ultimately be laid off in the coming weeks as part of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s plans to massively scale back the size of federal government.\n\n\u201cThe reality is clear: A large-scale reduction, in response to the President\u2019s workforce executive orders, is already happening. The government is restructuring, and unfortunately, many employees will later realize they missed a valuable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\u201d the official said.\n\nOPM is also sweetening the pot for older federal workers. It is now offering an early retirement incentive \u2013 known as Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, or VERA \u2013 to those who meet the eligibility criteria and who opt in to the deferred resignation program, a source familiar with the offer told CNN on Tuesday. Employees must be at least 50 years old with at least 20 years of service or be any age with at least 25 years of service.\n\nSome 2.4 million people work for the federal government, not including postal workers, who are not eligible for the deferred retirement package. Also excluded are military personnel and those in positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, among others.\n\nLast week, after the fatal collision between a regional passenger jet and a military helicopter, the National Transportation Safety Board informed employees they were not eligible for the program as the agency scrambles to keep investigators from leaving, despite initially receiving the offer.\n\nOn the flip side, the Central Intelligence Agency on Tuesday became the first major national security agency to offer the deferred resignation program to its entire workforce, a CIA spokesperson and two other sources familiar with the offer said.\n\nUnions oppose the offer\n\nFederal workers unions quickly lashed out at the deferred resignation offer, questioning its legality and stressing that the administration might not be able to follow through on it.\n\nAFGE, the largest federal workforce union, urged members on Monday not to be \u201ctricked into resigning,\u201d warning that they may not get paid.\n\nThe multiple communications from the Office of Personnel Management are \u201criddled with inconsistencies and uncertainties,\u201d AFGE told members about the offer in an FAQ last week. \u201cIt is also unclear whether OPM has the legal authority to support the Program or its alleged benefits, and the eligibility criteria are vague.\u201d\n\nThe union warned the offer contains no guarantees that employees whose resignations are accepted \u201cwill receive the benefits that the Program purports to offer.\u201d And it noted the federal government is only funded through mid-March, so the Trump administration cannot make payment promises beyond then until Congress passes a spending bill.\n\nIn its lawsuit, AFGE and the other unions, who collectively represent more than 800,000 federal civil servants, argue that the offer is contrary to law and OPM offers no statutory basis for it. The complaint also contends that the information that OPM has provided workers is misleading \u2013 including the agency\u2019s assertion that workers could take other jobs after resigning, although federal ethics rules restrict what outside employment current federal workers can accept.\n\nThe initial OPM email was written in a manner designed to coerce federal employees to resign, Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CNN in an interview last week. The union sent an urgent notice to its members \u201cstrongly\u201d urging them not to resign.\n\nOPM spokesperson McLaurine Pinover pushed back on the unions\u2019 characterization of the offer and claimed union leaders are misguiding federal workers.\n\n\u201cUnion leaders and politicians telling federal workers to reject this offer are doing them a serious disservice. This is a rare, generous opportunity\u2014one that was thoroughly vetted and intentionally designed to support employees through restructuring,\u201d Pinover said in a statement.\n\nThe initial OPM email, which bore the subject line \u201cFork in the Road,\u201d had many similarities to an email that X, then called Twitter, sent to its employees days after Musk took over the company. Musk now leads Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which has been tasked with shrinking the federal workforce as one of its mandates.\n\nThe offer came as Trump seeks to reshape the federal workforce \u2013 including reducing its size, replacing career workers with political appointees, wiping away some civil service protections, ending diversity efforts and more.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Katie Bo Lillis and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

                "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nAmericans love Shein, Temu and AliExpress for two reasons: cheap prices and fast shipping.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs could change that.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff orders reversed a long-standing shipping loophole: the de minimis exemption. The rule allowed international exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 inspection- and duty-free into the United States.\n\nChinese e-commerce sites have built their gargantuan business models around this exemption. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products has allowed more than a billion packages to pour in at a low-cost price for consumers looking for a deal on clothing to household goods.\n\nBut the Trump administration is getting rid of the provision that made these goods so cheap and easy to access.\n\n\u201cIf you inspect every package, it\u2019s going to raise costs dramatically for consumers,\u201d Clark Packard, a research fellow at Cato Trade, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to slow down the reception of goods that were bought.\u201d\n\nCurrently, US Customs and Border Protection has the authority to open and inspect all international packages, though in practice it doesn\u2019t open every single item.\n\nTrump enacted 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Tuesday, adding to a wide array of tariffs that were placed on goods from the country during his first term. (The administration delayed a 25% tariff order on Canada and Mexico until March 1.) Beijing hit back with a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks.\n\nThe ramifications of a looming US-China trade war on Shein and Temu consumers have begun to trickle in. On Tuesday, the United States Postal Service temporarily suspended the acceptance of international parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice. It did not provide a reason for the change, but said in a statement the flow of letters would not be affected.\n\nWhat is the de minimis provision?\n\nThe de minimis provision has been around since the 1930s, but the threshold has increased over the years. It\u2019s meant to ease trade and help out consumers, Packard told CNN.\n\nThe exemption means buyers don\u2019t have to fill out tiresome customs paperwork or pay tariffs on small packages.\n\nIn September 2024, the Biden administration announced it was cracking down on what it called abuse of the de minimis exemption, saying that over the past decade shipments increased from about 140 million a year to over a billion.\n\nWorkers make garments at a textile factory that supplies clothes to Shein in Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province, on June 11, 2024. Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe exponential increase made it more challenging to enforce trade laws and also posed challenges for American workers and businesses, upholding US consumer protections laws and combatting the fentanyl trade.\n\nThe Trump administration said the suspension will stop shipments of fentanyl from Mexico and Canada in small packages.\n\nPolicymakers already want to appear tough on China, said Rob Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University. The US also has concerns over fast fashion labor practices in China, though the administration has not specified why China is targeted.\n\nHow would customers be affected?\n\nThe de minimis exemption is why these Chinese goods are so cheap for US customers, said Christopher Tang, a professor of global supply chain management at the University of California, Los Angeles. More than 80% of total US e-commerce shipments in 2022 were de minimis imports, according to a congressional research report.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, \u201cconsumers bore basically 90 to 100% of the cost of a tariff,\u201d Packard said. \u201cSo, if that similar dynamic exists, consumers could expect a 10% increase if it\u2019s coming from China.\u201d\n\nCustoms is not equipped to handle this level of change, and it could cause other delays, Handfield said.\n\n\u201cThe operations would be horrendous in terms of implementation,\u201d Tang said.\n\nReshaping the business model\n\nIn 2024, Temu ran an ad during the Super Bowl (at a range of $6.5 million to $7 million for a 30-second spot) with $14 million in coupons and giveaways. The Boston-based firm \u2014 owned by PDD (PDD), the group behind Chinese online shopping giant Pinduoduo \u2014 paid for three ads during the game and two after the game.\n\nWhether that will happen at this year\u2019s Super Bowl in February is now in question.\n\nCutting the exemption could significantly taper the growth of Chinese e-commerce companies, according to a Bank of America research note. Those cuts could hit the marketing budget.\n\nAmericans are used to seeing Temu and Shein everywhere. Revenue from China-based advertisers grew from 6% of Meta\u2019s family of apps revenue to 11% in 2024, according to the company\u2019s financial reports. Bank of America estimated Temu and Shein exposure could be 2% to 4% of ad spend for Google and Meta.\n\nTo get around this, companies can expand their warehouses in the US, Tang said. They can ship bulk amounts through customs and then reship it across the US \u2013 but customers will still have to pay the import tax. The perk would be that could create more US jobs, Tang said.\n\nThe companies could also ship products to other ASEAN countries such as Vietnam and ship it to the US there, but the extra shipping costs would also eventually trickle down to customers.\n\nCNN\u2019s Eric Cheung and Simone McCarthy contributed to this report.",

He was 88.\n\nHis Aga Khan Foundation and the Ismaili religious community announced on their websites that His Highness Prince Karim Al-Hussaini, the Aga Khan IV and 49th hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, died Tuesday in Portugal surrounded by his family.\n\nThey said an announcement on his successor would come later.\n\nConsidered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan IV was a student when his grandfather passed over his playboy father as his successor to lead the diaspora of Shia Ismaili Muslims, saying his followers should be led by a young man \u201cwho has been brought up in the midst of the new age.\u201d\n\nOver decades, the Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly and mixing them with ease.\n\nTreated as a head of state, the Aga Khan was given the title of \u201cHis Highness\u201d by Queen Elizabeth in July 1957, two weeks after his grandfather the Aga Khan III unexpectedly made him heir to the family\u2019s 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect.\n\nHe became the Aga Khan IV on Oct. 19, 1957, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on the spot where his grandfather once had his weight equaled in diamonds in gifts from his followers.\n\nHe had left Harvard to be at his ailing grandfather\u2019s side, and returned to school 18 months later with an entourage and a deep sense of responsibility.\n\n\u201cI was an undergraduate who knew what his work for the rest of his life was going to be,\u201d he said in a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in my situation would have been prepared.\u201d\n\nA defender of Islamic culture and values, he was widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his reticence to become involved in politics.\n\nThe Aga Khan Development Network, his main philanthropic organization, dealt mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development.\n\nA network of hospitals bearing his name are scattered in countries where health care had lacked for the poorest, including Bangladesh, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where he spent tens of millions of dollars for development of local economies.\n\nHis eye for building and design led him to establish an architecture prize, and programs for Islamic Architecture at MIT and Harvard. He restored ancient Islamic structures throughout the world.\n\nAccounts differ as to the date and place of Prince Karim Aga Khan\u2019s birth. According to \u201cWho\u2019s Who in France,\u201d he was born on Dec. 13, 1936, in Creux-de-Genthod, near Geneva, Switzerland, the son of Joan Yarde-Buller and Aly Khan.\n\nThe extent of the Aga Khan\u2019s financial empire is hard to measure. Some reports estimated his personal wealth to be in the billions.\n\nThe Ismailis \u2014 a sect originally centered in India but which expanded to large communities in east Africa, Central and South Asia and the Middle East \u2014 consider it a duty to tithe up to 10% of their income to him as steward.\n\n\u201cWe have no notion of the accumulation of wealth being evil,\u201d he told Vanity Fair in 2012. \u201cThe Islamic ethic is that if God has given you the capacity or good fortune to be a privileged individual in society, you have a moral responsibility to society.\u201d\n\nHe is survived by three sons and a daughter.",

                "text": "Seoul CNN \u2014\n\nSecurity officials confiscating bottles of water, tubes of shower gel and pots of face creams are a common sight at airport security.\n\nBut officials enforcing the no-liquids rule at South Korea\u2019s Incheon International Airport have been busy seizing another outlawed item: kimchi, a concoction of salted and fermented vegetables that is a staple of every Korean dinner table.\n\nLast year, officials at Incheon International Airport (ICN) confiscated a total of 10.7 tons of the country\u2019s must-have side dish from passengers violating the ban on liquid in carry-on luggage, according to the airport.\n\nThat\u2019s because pre-packaged kimchi often comes in a bottle or plastic bag and is soaked in spicy sauce, meaning it counts as a liquid. Like many other airports around the world, authorities at ICN ban liquids and gels exceeding 100ml in carry-on luggage.\n\nSouth Korean workers wash cabbage as they make kimchi at the Pulmuone Kimchi factory south of Seoul. Lee Young-ho/SIPAPRE/Sipa USA/AP\n\nAcross 2024, the airport officials say they also confiscated 10.5 tons of jang, a word covering a wide range of traditional fermented sauces and pastes.\n\nOne YouTube video posted last year by a popular Korean travel influencer reminding travelers that kimchi was check-in-only has racked up 1.2 million views.\n\nConfiscated items generally get disposed or donated, but all 10.7 tons of kimchi were donated to a local community welfare center, according to airport officials.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time that Korean officials have taken a strong stance on a popular food product.\n\nIn 2024, Korean Air, the country\u2019s flagship airline, announced that it would no longer serve ramyeon instant noodles to passengers traveling in economy on long-haul flights. The airline cited \u201cthe increasing trend of turbulence\u201d making it too dangerous to serve the snack \u2013- which is made by adding boiling water.\n\nIn addition, travelers bringing Trader Joe\u2019s Everything But the Bagel mix into South Korea reported running afoul of authorities. The product, which is only sold in the United States, has gone viral on TikTok and is a popular \u201csouvenir\u201d for travelers who are returning from America.\n\nThe popular seasoning mix was deemed illegal because it contains poppy seeds, an oilseed banned in Korea.\n\nOne South Korean blogger reported that she brought back 20 bottles of the seasoning upon returning home from a visit to the US. However, she said, the bottles came out of the luggage conveyer belt with a yellow lock on them and were later confiscated by officials.\n\nNow, signs in Korean and English have been placed throughout the terminal warning travelers against trying to bring Everything But the Bagel seasoning mixes into the country.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe year is 1984. It\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday and you turn on the TV to see a procession of stern men marching through a tunnel. No, it\u2019s not the Los Angeles Raiders. It\u2019s the most important Super Bowl commercial of all time.\n\nApple\u2019s iconic Macintosh advert, simply called \u201c1984\u201d and based on George\u2019s Orwell\u2019s novel of the same name, featured a \u201cBig Brother\u201d figure addressing hordes of subjects from a giant screen and a woman who escapes riot police to smash the screen with a hammer.\n\nWhen viewed now, it is the epitome of the 1980s \u2013 CRT TVs, dramatic voiceovers and big hair. But back then, it was unlike any commercial America had ever seen.\n\n\u201cThey sold $150 million worth of computers in 100 days,\u201d says David Stubley \u2013 sports marketing expert and author of Gamechangers and Rainmakers: How Sport Became Big Business \u2013 in an interview with CNN Sport. \u201cThe whole ad industry just stopped in their tracks and went: \u2018What just happened? How did that happen?\u2019\u201d\n\nA big splash\n\nIt might be hard to believe, but the Super Bowl was not always such a big deal. Long before Taylor Swift or the invention of the jumbotron, Super Bowl I was won, fairly comfortably, by the 1967 Green Bay Packers.\n\nIf you were one of the 24 million people watching at home, you would have seen halftime commercials from the likes of Goodyear, McDonald\u2019s and Tang, each of whom would have paid a reported $38,000 for the slot \u2013 about $350,000 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nBy 1984, Stubley estimates that companies were forking out around $300,000, or $900,000 adjusted. That\u2019s a sizeable amount, until you consider that the NFL is now selling some 30-second slots for $8 million.\n\nApple teamed up with director Ridley Scott and advertising agency Chiat/Day to create the iconic commercial. From Fairbanks Films/Chiat/Day\n\nIt would be disingenuous to claim that \u201c1984\u201d is the sole reason for Super Bowl commercials now releasing with the fanfare that they do. But, as Stubley explains, there is a noticeable \u201cbefore and after\u201d effect around the iconic commercial.\n\n\u201cAdvertising before that time was either cheesy, personality driven, or what I would describe as transactional \u2013 \u2018Here it is, do you want it?\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cWhat this ad did, it basically said: \u2018Forget everything that\u2019s happened in the past. And the only way to do that is to smash that hammer through that big screen.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise that the commercial was so cinematic, given who directed it. Ridley Scott had enjoyed so much success with \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner\u201d by that point that many did not realize the Englishman had actually started his career in the advertising industry.\n\nHis signature dystopian style lent itself perfectly to Orwell\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cWe were all so scared about 1984, so it tapped into that brilliantly,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cEveryone thought the world was going to come to an end in 1984, if you\u2019d read George Orwell\u2019s book. And so to have this take on that whole scariness and confront it in such a brilliant way, I think it really caught people\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nHaving just directed 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner,' two of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, Ridley Scott was at the peak of his powers. frederic meylan/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nDespite the Macintosh computer never actually featuring in the commercial itself, it is hard not hard to infer that \u201cBig Brother\u201d represented the existing tech companies.\n\n\u201cThe juxtaposition between the alternative of IBM and HP and Dell and this was probably what made it so exciting for everybody. It\u2019s a bit like the Air Jordans 10 years later. You know, sticking two fingers up to the establishment,\u201d explains Stubley.\n\n\u201cSteve Jobs, if you look at any of his talks from that era, he openly stokes that. He says: \u2018All these suits who just crank out vanilla hardware and vanilla software, there\u2019s got to be a better way, surely.\u2019 He was very good at saying: \u2018That\u2019s the establishment, that\u2019s traditional. We\u2019re nothing to do with that.\u2019\u201d\n\nHandily for Apple, the 1980s were not only defined by Orwellian anxiety. They were also a decade when advertisers started to devote real attention \u2013 and budget \u2013 to the power of the little box in everyone\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cTV advertising at that time suddenly blew up. All these new categories suddenly discovered it,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cIn America, there was this huge war between Miller and Budweiser. Then you had finance suddenly discovering the power of TV, retail discovering the power of TV. So all of these categories were all kind of piling in.\u201d\n\nIt meant Apple were able to spend the kind of money \u2013 estimated by Stubley to be around $600,000 ($1.8 million when adjusted for inflation) \u2013 that was required for what was essentially a 60-second blockbuster.\n\nThe then-Los Angeles Raiders defeated the then-Washington Redskins 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII. Owen C. Shaw/Getty Images/File\n\nOf course, you can spend all the money you want on the perfect Super Bowl commercial, but if everyone the next day is talking about the game itself, then the effects will be limited.\n\nLuckily for Steve Jobs and co., that was not the case. With the Raiders up 21-3 on the then-named Washington Redskins at halftime, the contest was essentially over.\n\n\u201cAll the action was taking place in the ad break, not on the pitch,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there, it\u2019s a dull game, you know what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019ve got your beer, you\u2019ve got your burger. You\u2019re sitting through traditional advertising \u2013 Taco Bell, Walmart, whatever.\n\n\u201cAnd then suddenly, boom! This thing comes into your living room. It must have been shocking.\u201d\n\nA new age\n\nThe success of the Macintosh commercial, according to Stubley, prompted other companies to spend bigger on their own Super Bowl advertising.\n\n\u201cPost-1984 there was a lot of money to go around,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so if you want to build rapid brand awareness (and) you\u2019ve got a $400 million ad budget, as Budweiser would have had in the 90s, and you want to put Miller Light back in its box \u2026 you just buy up the ad breaks in the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nEven now, when Super Bowl commercials come with a price tag of $8 million, Stubley still believes they can be a worthwhile investment.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to build brand awareness amongst American adults aged 35 and under, the Super Bowl is one of the quickest ways of doing it, if not exactly the cheapest,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut the halftime advertising landscape after the Apple commercial was not just defined by its ever-increasing budgets. Companies also borrowed stylistically from the way Apple approached the task. Nowadays, more than 40 years later, it is not hard to see the ripples left by \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nBig-name directors routinely trade Hollywood for the Super Bowl, with the likes of Martin Scorsese, David Fincher and Zack Snyder all contributing commercials in recent years.\n\nIn fact, many halftime commercials are now mini movies in themselves, with A-list actors, storylines, and even teaser trailers released ahead of time. Many tune in just to watch the adverts, such is their cultural importance.\n\n'Gamechangers and Rainmakers: How Sport Became Big Business' was published in January. Courtesy Pitch Publishing\n\nIn the streaming age, when many people can watch anything at any time, live sports remain as one of the few ways advertisers can create watercooler moments.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s fragmented world, to still be able to get 120 million Americans \u2013 that\u2019s not even the global audience \u2013 to sit in front of something, it\u2019s quite breathtaking,\u201d says Stubley.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest event in the advertising calendar, period.\u201d\n\nThis year, when you watch Kendrick Lamar perform in the halftime show, it will likely be accompanied by a small Apple logo in the bottom-right corner \u2013 a privilege the tech giant paid $50 million for.\n\nAnd if you find yourself laughing, or texting a friend, or just thinking about about any of the commercials you see this Sunday, spare a thought for \u201c1984.\u201d They might not exist without it.",

Early Tuesday morning, hundreds of people carrying their belongings were seen waiting at a port on the island, waiting for a ferry to take them to Athens.\n\nA tremor with a magnitude of 4.8 was recorded early Tuesday, just shy of a 4.9 quake recorded over the weekend \u2013 the strongest so far. Over the past three days, some 550 tremors with a magnitude of 3.0 have been recorded in the Aegean Sea, between Santorini and the nearby islands of Amorgos and Ios.\n\nGreece\u2019s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization (OASP) has estimated that the intense seismic activity may continue for many more days, if not weeks.\n\nSantorini, dubbed Greece\u2019s \u201cInstagram Island,\u201d attracts some 3.4 million visitors a year but is only home to around 20,000 permanent residents.

                "text": "Berlin CNN \u2014\n\nWhen British comedian and presenter Amelia Dimoldenberg stepped onto the red carpet to interview Sydney Sweeney in 2022, it only took a second for Dimoldenberg\u2019s dress to reverse their roles. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Sweeney said, reaching out to touch the presenters\u2019 sleeveless black floor-length gown. The fabric \u2014 an opaque mass of rubbery spider-like webs \u2014 giggled with each movement. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. The intricate, lacelike piece (made from 3D-printed latex) was the work of German designer Kasia Kucharska. Sweeney\u2019s curiosity is echoed by the industry. Earlier this year, Kucharska won \u20ac100,000 ($102,835) to keep developing her creations.\n\n\u201cIt feels amazing,\u201d she told CNN of the win from her studio in Berlin, where she presented her first runway show on Sunday. The German capital\u2019s fashion week \u2014 which ran from January 31 to February 3 \u2014 was founded in 2007, but grew its international guest list this season by over 40%. Alongside the six-figure grant, Kucharska\u2019s prize from the Fashion Council Germany and Vogue Fashion Fund included the opportunity to stage a runway show and receive mentorship from industry experts on distribution, brand and collection development. \u201cIt\u2019s been a ride\u2026 The support has been so great,\u201d she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This centuries-old technique is getting a new life in latex 01:22 - Source: CNN This centuries-old technique is getting a new life in latex 01:22\n\nWhile studying at the Berlin University of the Arts, Kucharska became interested in the opulent fashion of the 18th and 19th century \u2014 particularly the era\u2019s lacework seen in underwear, shirts, collars and cuffs. Pinned to her studio\u2019s reference board are Elizabethan portraits; scraps of leavers lace in black, white and pink; as well as photographs of historical garments. Lace dates at least as far back as the early 16th century, where it was handmade using a single needle and thread to stitch a delicate pattern or braided using multiple threads, by nuns. Later, heaving Victorian-era steel machines, monitored by twisthands \u2014 human machine operators overseeing the twisting, knitting and braiding of cotton into delicate lace \u2014 mechanized the industry. This type of lace production has largely died out, with only a few active lace mills remaining. Today, the process can be entirely computerized and automated.\n\nWhile Kucharska\u2019s final creations are far more unconventional than the hand-woven filigree of traditional lace, the two processes are similar in their meticulousness. She uses a combination of poured and printed latex for her pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s handmade,\u201d she said of her materials. \u201cWe create in a very artisanal way here in our studio. It\u2019s a very time-consuming procedure.\u201d\n\nThroughout her collections, loopy, abstract flowers provide the basis for a range of designs. Two dense clusters of the spindly florals become a bikini-tie top, worn with an open-front catsuit that looks like it was drawn directly onto the models body. During her most recent runway, Kucharska layered her latex lace tights under shirts, ruched mini skirts and dresses. There is a na\u00efve element to her spiral designs in birthday party colors, like doodles in a schoolbook.\n\nKucharska's pieces come in a range of birthday party colors and have a \"childish\" style to their form. Lillie Sophie Otto\n\nShe was inspired by lace techniques from the 18th and 19th century. Lillie Sophie Otto\n\nHer special liquid latex recipe (which is a business secret) can also be used to build bags without the need for sewing. Lillie Sophie Otto\n\nKucharska calls the looping shapes printed onto the sheer mesh \u201cchildish\u201d in the freedom of its form. Because of latex\u2019s malleable nature, her process is \u201cvery intuitive and experimental,\u201d she said. \u201cLatex is a liquid material. It\u2019s like milk from the tree. And we work with it in a very raw way, or we give pigment to it and then we pour it.\u201d\n\nFrom start to finish, each garment can take several days to make \u2014 as every piece requires rounds of cooling, drying and washing. But understanding the material has taken years, she added, from refining her techniques to perfecting her recipe, which remains a secret of her business.\n\nKucharska's garments feature sheer mesh panelling, on which the latex is either poured or 3D printed. Lillie Sophie Otto\n\nIn some of her pieces made up of fine spiral designs, there is a striking resemblance to lace. Lillie Sophie Otto\n\nKucharska began to realize the sartorial potential of liquid latex during her time at the Berlin University of the Arts. \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely durable material. It\u2019s biodegradable. It\u2019s sustainable. And you just can do so much with it,\u201d she said. Alongside her lacy dresses, which have been worn by the likes of Julia Fox and musician Chloe Bailey, Kucharska also uses latex to build bags from scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s really a mono-material,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think about boundaries, like how else can we do fashion without sewing?\u201d\n\nAnd for those considering making the leap from their grandmother\u2019s lace to a Kasia Kucharska piece, the designer has some advice: \u201cEmbrace who you are, be eccentric, be joyful, celebrate life. Have fun. Be daring, be confident.\u201d",

The Postal Service did not provide any additional information on the suspension when contacted by CNN.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that terminated the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, a long-standing rule that allowed anyone, including exporters, to ship packages worth less than $800 to the United States without duties or needing to undergo inspections.\n\nIt also follows the introduction of a broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the US, which took effect on Tuesday.\n\nCNN has reached out to other international delivery companies DHL and FedEx for comment.\n\nThe new rule is likely to affect e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu, which have built their gargantuan business models around this exemption. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products have allowed more than a billion packages to pour into the US at low prices for consumers looking for deals on clothing to household goods.\n\nCNN has also reached out to Shein and Temu for comment.\n\nThe termination will hit Chinese shipments the hardest, as nearly half of all packages shipped under the de minimis exemption originated there, Reuters reported, citing a June 2023 report by a US congressional committee on the country.\n\nBeijing has retaliated against the new Trump tariffs with a broad package of economic measures on Tuesday, including a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars, and pickup trucks. The measures will take effect on February 10.\n\nIt also imposed new export controls targeting over two dozen metal products and related technologies, and added two American firms, biotech company Illumina and fashion retailer PVH Group, to its unreliable entities list.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump indicated he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to defuse growing trade tensions, despite saying a day before that the two leaders could speak in the next 24 hours.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the de minimis suspension was related to the executive order, experts have told CNN the delivery of international parcels into the US would be \u201cslowed down\u201d if every package must be examined.\n\nCurrently, US Customs and Border Protection has the authority to open and inspect all international packages, though in practice it doesn\u2019t open every single item.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nNeed a new computer, television or phone? You might want to consider getting one now.\n\nThat\u2019s because President Donald Trump enacted a new 10% across-the-board tariff on Chinese goods Tuesday morning.\n\nEconomists warn that tariffs hurt American businesses and consumers, many of whom are still reeling from the sharp rise in inflation in recent years. Tariffs are paid by US importers, not the countries at which the tariffs are aimed, as Trump has claimed. Those costs are often passed on to retailers and eventually American consumers.\n\nUnlike Mexico and Canada, which largely avoid tariffs on exports to the United States because of the current USMCA trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term, a wide array of Chinese goods already faced tariffs before Tuesday. (Trump also ordered 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods but delayed them until March 1).\n\nIn addition to the new 10% tariff, Chinese goods are subject to additional tariffs: a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products. But several items had been exempt from tariffs.\n\nOne of the biggest exemptions had been consumer electronics. But that exemption is no longer in place with the new across-the-board tariffs. That matters because consumer electronics are among the top goods the US imported from China last year, according to federal trade data.\n\nCommunications equipment accounted for 12%, or $47 billion, of the $401 billion worth of goods the US imported from China last year, not accounting for December, making it the single top category of goods the US imported from there. (December trade data is set to be released Wednesday.)\n\nCommunications equipment includes everything from cellphones to TVs to satellites, according to the classification system the US government uses.\n\nValued at $39 billion, the second-biggest category of goods the US imported from China last year was computer equipment. That includes tablets, laptops, monitors and essentially all the components that power them, such as semiconductor chips and and network interface cards.\n\nThen comes the $37 billion category of goods deemed \u201cmiscellaneous manufactured commodities\u201d the US imported from China last year. Toys, jewelry, silverware, and sporting equipment are all among the goods included in that umberella category.\n\nLike many consumer electronics, they\u2019ve virtually escaped many tariffs in place on Chinese goods imported to the US.\n\nAlso expect shoe and sneaker prices to rise. The footwear industry is particularly exposed to tariffs because roughly 99% of all shoes and sneakers sold in the United States are imported, mostly from China and Vietnam, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make a list of ways to drive up prices, this would be at the top of the list. It\u2019s totally counterproductive,\u201d Matt Priest, president and CEO of the FDRA told CNN in a phone interview on Monday. \u201cWe pay the tariffs. The American consumers pay the tariffs. These are not external revenue sources. They are internal.\u201d\n\nThe trade group represents Nike, DSW, Under Armour and dozens of other brands.\n\nSo when will consumers feel the sting from the 10% tariff?\n\nPrices probably won\u2019t rise immediately on stuff coming into the United States from China \u2014 goods have been warehoused without the additional 10% tariff for quite some time. But as inventories clear out and new Chinese items come ashore, American consumers will start to bear the burden.\n\nA complicating factor: Some retailers may be able to absorb the higher costs of tariffs, especially if they\u2019ve stockpiled additional inventory in advance.\n\nBut others may not be able to afford to do so, in which case consumers could expect to see price increases in the near future.",

                "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nBeijing announced a broad package of economic measures targeting the United States on Tuesday, hitting back after US President Donald Trump imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe fresh duties, announced by China\u2019s Ministry of Finance, levy a 15% tax on certain types of coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars and pickup trucks. The measures take effect on February 10.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce and China\u2019s customs administration also announced new export controls effective immediately on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. Those include tungsten, a critical mineral typically used in industrial and defense applications, as well as tellurium, which can be used to make solar cells.\n\nThe ministry also said it was adding two American firms \u2014 biotech company Illumina and fashion retailer PVH Group, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger \u2014 to its unreliable entities list, saying they \u201cviolated normal market trading principles.\u201d\n\nA Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said Tuesday that it found PVH discriminated against and interfered with the operations of Chinese companies, though the spokesperson failed to provide specifics.\n\nPVH criticized the decision and said it would work with Chinese authorities to resolve the situation.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,\u201d a spokesperson for PVH said in a statement. \u201cIn our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our consumers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said it was initiating an investigation into Google for suspected violation of its anti-monopoly. The company, whose search engine is not available in China, has minimal operations in the country.\n\nThe raft of announcements come as a broad-based 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the United States announced by the White House on Saturday came into effect.\n\nChina\u2019s measures appear to vary in their potential impact on the US economy and businesses. For example, China is the leading global producer of tungsten concentrates, representing more than 80% of world production, according to US government estimates from 2020. The tariffed items, however, represent a relatively small proportion of overall bilateral trade.\n\n\u201cThe measures are fairly modest, at least relative to US moves, and have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China Economics at financial insight firm Capital Economics, said in a research note Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese tariffs target at most $20 billion of the country\u2019s annual imports from the US, about 12% of the total, which is \u201ca far cry\u201d from the more than $450 billion in Chinese goods being targeted by the US, he added.\n\nBeijing had slammed those tariffs in a statement Sunday and vowed to \u201cresolutely defend its rights\u201d by filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and taking \u201ccorresponding countermeasures.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, China\u2019s commerce ministry confirmed that it had brought the Trump administration\u2019s tariff measures to the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.\n\n\u201cThe US practice seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States, and disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nA new trade war?\n\nThe Chinese measures, announced on the final day of China\u2019s week-long new year holiday, mark what could be the opening salvo of a new tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing. However, they don\u2019t rule out the possibility of further dialogue or deal-making between the two sides.\n\nThe White House had announced the 10% tariffs on Chinese imports on Saturday as part of broader trade measures also targeting Mexico and Canada \u2013 part of what the Trump administration said was a bid to hold those countries accountable for illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl and other drugs into the US.\n\nTrump agreed to \u201cimmediately pause\u201d tariffs on Mexico and Canada after holding separate calls with those countries\u2019 leaders Monday \u2014 the day before the duties on goods from all three countries were meant to come into effect. Both leaders had agreed to strengthen security along their borders.\n\nTrump said Monday that he expected he could speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the next 24 hours. Beijing has yet to confirm any call. A White House spokesperson said later Monday the call could happen \u201cin the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nThis potential exchange comes as Beijing and Washington aim to set the tone for their relationship and navigate a raft of thorny issues \u2014 including a gaping trade deficit, a tech and military rivalry and the fentanyl trade.\n\nUS law enforcement believes a number of China-based entities supply precursor chemicals, which can be used to make finished fentanyl in labs operated by drug cartels in the US and Mexico. Canada makes up just 0.2% of US border fentanyl seizures.\n\nBeijing has defended its efforts to control exports of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl and said the latest tariffs would \u201cerode the foundation of trust and cooperation in the field of drug control between China and the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Shanghai stock index was still closed Tuesday for the Lunar New Year holiday. But stock markets elsewhere in Asia closed higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index rose 2.8%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index was 0.7% up and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI 1.1% higher. Both fell Monday.\n\nUS stock futures were relatively flat.\n\nRoom for a deal\n\nThe 10% duties are a far cry from the upwards of 60% tariffs that Trump had threatened to levy on China during his campaign, signaling that there could be more to come if the two sides are not able to reach a deal on a broader host of issues.\n\nTrump campaigned on winning an economic competition against China, and, on his first day in office, ordered a review of the US-China economic relationship, which is due April 1. The results could form the basis for additional duties on Chinese goods. Those could address the gaping trade imbalance between the two countries, while Trump has specifically linked the 10% tariffs to the fentanyl trade.\n\nThe US president has also said he hopes that countries can reach a trade deal and work together on issues, including ending the war in Ukraine. He also paused the enforcement of a law requiring the ban of social media app TikTok if its Chinese parent company did not divest its US business.\n\nThese issues are expected to factor into expected talks between the two countries in the weeks and months to come.\n\nBeijing has also signaled its intention to avoid a spiraling trade war like the one seen during Trump\u2019s first term in office. At that time, the White House slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of US imports from China, while Beijing retaliated.\n\nChina has diversified its economy and trade partners since that time, but its export-reliant economy is grappling with slowing growth and other challenges.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and context.",

The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet was due to land at the airport Wednesday night when it collided midair with the US Army helicopter as it approached Runway 33, according to the FAA and defense officials.\n\nThe US Army Black Hawk helicopter was conducting a routine training for pilots who take part in \u201ccontinuity of government\u201d missions, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the collision. The crash is the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since November 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in New York, killing all 260 people on board.",

They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.\n\nThe timeline is \u201ccontingent upon priority of lifts, requirements for offload, cataloging of wreckage, weather and tidal considerations,\u201d according to the release.\n\nThe salvage operations come as authorities continue to search for human remains in the aftermath of the disaster. A total of 67 people are thought to be dead after American Eagle Flight 5342 collided with the helicopter.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies had been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water, sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.\n\nAuthorities expect to recover all of the bodies, Donnelly said at a Sunday news conference.\n\n\u201cWe have some work to do as this salvage operation goes on, and we will absolutely stay here and search until such point as we have everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nAn automatic work stoppage will take place if any more bodies are discovered during the salvage operations, Col. Francis Pera, commander of the Corps of Engineers\u2019 Baltimore district, said at the news conference.\n\n\u201cThe dignified recovery of missing flight passengers and personnel takes precedence,\u201d he said.\n\nPieces of the aircraft will be lifted from the river onto a flatbed trailer that will take them to a designated hangar so they can be analyzed as part of the collision investigation. The hangar is controlled by the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.\n\n\u201cWhen we begin the lift process tomorrow, our goal is to really lift as much as we can, given the fact that we are also accounting for the human remains component,\u201d said Pera.\n\nAdditionally, the Coast Guard is monitoring a \u201csafety zone\u201d north of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the Potomac River. Only authorized vessels are able to enter the area, Capt. Pat Burkett, the central commander for Coast Guard sector Maryland, National Capital Region, said Sunday.\n\nDonnelly, who has been meeting with families of the victims, described them as \u201ca strong group of families that are focused on getting their loved ones back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people have suffered a terrible loss,\u201d he said.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he wants access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral deposits in exchange for future military aid that Kyiv needs as it continues to defend itself against Russia\u2019s aggression.\n\nWhile the comment highlighted Trump\u2019s transactional approach to the war in Ukraine, it was not entirely unexpected. The US and other Western countries have eyed Ukraine\u2019s mineral riches for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earths. And I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do (that),\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, without specifying what, if anything, Ukraine had agreed to do.\n\nHe has previously suggested that any future assistance should be provided as a loan and would be conditioned on Ukraine negotiating with Russia.\n\nUnder former US President Joe Biden, the US had provided Ukraine with $65.9 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.\n\nBiden argued the aid was necessary because Ukraine\u2019s victory was key to America\u2019s own security. Trump, however, has made it clear he doesn\u2019t believe the US should continue providing assistance without getting something in return.\n\nWhile Trump did not give any details on what he wants from Kyiv, a deal outlining a deeper cooperation between the US and Ukraine on minerals had been in the works for months before he took office in January.\n\nA memorandum of understanding prepared under the Biden administration last year said the US would promote investment opportunities in Ukraine\u2019s mining projects to American companies in exchange for Kyiv creating economic incentives and implementing good business and environmental practices.\n\nUkraine already has a similar agreement with the European Union, signed in 2021.\n\nAdam Mycyk, a partner in the Kyiv office of the global law firm Dentons, said that while the objective of the deal \u2013 securing critical mineral supplies from Ukraine \u2013 remains unchanged, Trump\u2019s approach seems to be more transactional.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen what form such an agreement could take, but it would be in Ukraine\u2019s best interests for its post-war recovery and long-term economic prospects to maximize as much as possible the processing and value creation of any extracted minerals in Ukraine by Ukrainian companies,\u201d Mycyk told CNN.\n\nKyiv has not yet responded to Trump\u2019s comments, but the Ukrainian government has in the past made the argument that its mineral deposits are one of the reasons the West should support Ukraine \u2013 to prevent these strategically important resources from falling into Russian hands.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has specifically mentioned the possibility of future investments in the country\u2019s natural resources by its Western allies as a key part of his \u201cVictory plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deposits of critical resources in Ukraine, along with Ukraine\u2019s globally important energy and food production potential, are among the key predatory objectives of the Russian Federation in this war. And this is our opportunity for growth,\u201d Zelensky said in a statement outlining the plan in October.\n\nNataliya Katser-Buchkovska, the co-founder of the Ukrainian Sustainable Investment Fund, said a deal that would bring US investment into Ukraine\u2019s mining sector would be beneficial for both sides.\n\nThe US largely depends on imports for the minerals it needs, many of which come from China. Of the 50 minerals classed as critical, the US was entirely dependent on imports of 12 and more than 50% dependent on imports of a further 16, according to the United States Geological Survey, a government agency.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, has deposits of 22 of these 50 critical materials, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cIt is not only a crucial step for Ukraine\u2019s post-war economic recovery, but it\u2019s also a chance for the US to address global supply chain issues,\u201d said Katser-Buchkovska, who served as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament from 2014 to 2019 and was the head of a parliamentary committee on energy security and transition.\n\nChina\u2019s global dominance\n\nAlthough Trump used the term \u201crare earths,\u201d it is unclear whether he intended to refer specifically to rare earth minerals \u2013 a group of 17 elements that exist in the earth\u2019s core and have magnetic and conductive properties that make them crucial to the production of electronics, clean energy technologies and some weapon systems.\n\nUkraine doesn\u2019t have globally significant reserves of rare earth minerals, but it does have some of the world\u2019s largest deposits of graphite, lithium, titanium, beryllium and uranium, all of which are classed by the US as critical minerals. Some of these reserves are in areas that are currently under Russian occupation.\n\nChina has long dominated the global production of rare earth minerals and other strategically important materials. It is responsible for nearly 90% of global processing of rare earth minerals, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). On top of that, China is also the world\u2019s largest producer of graphite and titanium, and a major processor of lithium.\n\nThe latest trade spat between Washington and Beijing makes it even more important for the US to look for alternative suppliers.\n\nThe economic measures China announced on Tuesday in retaliation for Trump\u2019s new tariffs include new export controls on more than two dozen metal products and related technologies. While they do not cover the most critical materials the US needs, the move indicates that China is prepared to use its mineral riches as leverage in trade disputes.\n\nMycyk said that the demand for these critical materials is expected to surge because of the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s deposits are thus globally significant, offering diversification away from dominant producers like China. Keeping these resources under Ukrainian control is crucial for maintaining its economic sovereignty,\u201d he added.",

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nYour parents may be right: Get some sleep and you\u2019ll feel better in the morning, according to new research.\n\n\u201cOur study suggests that people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing could fluctuate over time of day,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Feifei Bu, principal research fellow in statistics and epidemiology at University College London, in an email. \u201cOn average, people seem to feel best early in the day and worst late at night.\u201d\n\nTo find out how mental health and well-being ebbed and flowed, researchers analyzed University College London data of 49,218 people who were surveyed more than a dozen times between March 2020 and March 2022, according to the study published in the journal BMJ Mental Health.\n\nThe data showed a trend of people generally reporting better mental health and well-being earlier in the day, with less severe depressive symptoms and increased happiness, life satisfaction and sense of self-worth, Bu said.\n\nThe limitations of the research\n\nIt is important to note that while a correlation was found, researchers can\u2019t say for sure that the time of day caused people to have better mental health and well-being, Bu added.\n\n\u201cTime of day could affect people\u2019s mental health and well-being, but people\u2019s mental state could also affect when they choose to respond to the survey,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile our findings are intriguing, they need to be replicated in other studies that fully address this possibility.\u201d\n\nAnd mental health and well-being may need to be looked at separately, said Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center and professor emerita of media psychology at Fielding Graduate University in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\u201cMental health and well-being are two overlapping but distinct constructs. Mental health is a crucial part of well-being, but well-being is more than just mental health,\u201d she said.\n\nWell-being is a positive state determined by social, economic and environmental conditions that includes quality of life and a sense of meaning and purpose, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIt makes sense that mental health and well-being are at the focus of this study, as previous studies looked mostly at associations with mood, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cMood is a temporary affective state, while mental health and well-being are broader and more stable conditions that include emotional, psychological, and cognitive appraisals,\u201d she added.\n\nWhen resources are available\n\nKnowing how mental health and well-being fluctuate may give new insight into how resources should be made available.\n\n\u201cMental health support services may consider adjusting resources to match fluctuating needs across the day \u2014 for instance, prioritising late-night availability,\u201d Bu said in an email.\n\nThis latest study confirms what previous research has already found: \u201cThe demand for interventions and care, especially among young people, rises in the evening and seasonally, influenced by temperature, day length, and cultural, regional and individual differences,\u201d Rutledge added.\n\nConfront hard things when its best for you\n\nDoes the research show it\u2019s better to just go to bed and handle emotionally difficult things in the morning, then?\n\nThe research is conflicting, but most evidence points to late morning as the best time for that kind of problem solving, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cResearch suggests that mood is relatively stable in the late morning, which makes it easier to handle tough topics with a level head and emotional distance,\u201d she added.\n\nMidafternoon is when levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, may be lower, but that decrease is countered by research that shows that mood dips and decision fatigue sets in around that time of day, Rutledge said.\n\n\u201cThe early evening may be best for personal emotional processing, such as journaling and reflection, once emotional balance is regained. It may also be a good time for empathetic listening rather than having those tough conversations,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile there are physiological changes throughout the day that may influence how you handle things, there are bigger correlations between mental health and well-being and time of year, according to Rutledge. What\u2019s more, stress, autonomy, social support and environmental conditions all have an impact on mood as well, she added.\n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t a morning person, this research doesn\u2019t have to mean you should rearrange your life, Bu said.\n\n\u201cYour personal experience may vary,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are a night owl who feels (in) top form at midnight, don\u2019t panic.\u201d",

Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nYou have been brushing your teeth for most of your life, but are you sure you\u2019re doing it right?\n\nFour elements are the basis of good oral hygiene: brushing twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, flossing once a day, eating a healthy diet, and seeing a dentist regularly, said Dr. Matthew Messina, clinical associate professor at the Ohio State University College of Dentistry and a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.\n\nIf you do those four things, you are already in a great place, he said.\n\nDental health is important for many reasons \u2013\u2013 not only for fresh breath and pearly whites, but also to prevent gum and periodontal disease, which can be associated with health impacts in other parts of the body, said Dr. Michaela Gibbs, a professor and associate dean of clinical affairs and professional practice at the University of Colorado School of Dental Medicine.\n\nSmall changes to current health can make a difference to your oral health, experts said. Here\u2019s what to do.\n\nThe right order for clean teeth\n\nWhen it comes to brushing, flossing and using a mouth rinse, the goal is controlling the bacteria on your teeth, Messina said.\n\n\u201cWe have to stir them up and dislodge them, and also reduce the food that they\u2019re feeding on,\u201d he added.\n\nBacteria on the teeth burn sugars and produce acid, which dissolves tooth enamel. Weakened enamel eventually causes cavities, but reducing the time that bacteria have access to sugars on your teeth and using fluoride products can help prevent that breakdown, Messina said.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the order of things, it does make some sense,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nYou want to start with flossing to remove the debris from between your teeth that can then be further removed when you brush \u2013\u2013 which gets to the rest of the surface, she added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been a lot of scientific studies, but that is kind of the accepted standard of practice across the profession,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nAnd yes, you need both brushing and flossing to get your teeth totally clean, said Dr. Rocio B. Quinonez, associate dean for curriculum at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Adams School of Dentistry.\n\nFlossing takes care of approximately 40% of tooth surfaces, while brushing takes care of the other 60%, she said.\n\nRinse out toothpaste?\n\nIf you are like many people, you brush and then swish and spit a mouthful of water to get all the toothpaste residue out. But the rinsing may be better skipped, Gibbs said.\n\nInstead, spit out what you can and leave the residue on, Quinonez said.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is you want to retain as much fluoride from the toothpaste on your teeth after you brush (as possible),\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cAfter you brush your teeth with the fluoride toothpaste, you shouldn\u2019t rinse, because the whole benefit of the fluoride is only realized if it sits on the teeth for up to 30 minutes after you brush.\u201d\n\nBrushing and then immediately rinsing out a toothpaste that has fluoride could negate the benefits, she said.\n\n\u201cThe longer the fluoride sits on the teeth, the greater effect it has,\u201d Messina added. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident that I recommended you brush last after breakfast and before bed, because those are the times that we have the greatest length of time before we actually eat something again that might disturb the fluoride sitting on the teeth.\u201d\n\nIf you want to get a drink of water or use a mouthwash without fluoride, Gibbs recommends not doing it immediately after brushing so that the fluoride can penetrate the tooth\u2019s surface.\n\nAnd although you should avoid ones with alcohol in them, a mouthwash with fluoride as the last part of your routine can also help strengthen teeth, Quinonez said.\n\nJust as long as you keep a daily routine\n\nMore important than the order, however, is that you are consistently brushing and flossing, Messina said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just whatever way you\u2019re going to do effectively every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a piece missing \u2026 then try it one way and maybe try it another way and see which one you like better.\u201d\n\nAn electric toothbrush is often recommended, although a manual one can work as well, especially if cost is a concern, Gibbs said. And although water picks can be helpful, flossing is the gold standard, she added.\n\nA perhaps unexpected tool in the fight for better oral hygiene is drinking water, Quinonez said. Regular water, that is, not flavored or carbonated.\n\nNot only does drinking water help wash out debris, but it also restores a normal pH balance in the mouth that can be thrown off by eating and drinking, Gibbs added. A lower pH in your mouth even from otherwise healthy foods, like fruits and vegetables, means a more acidic environment that can make you more susceptible to cavities.\n\n\u201cIf you brush twice a day, floss once a day, eat a healthy diet, see your dentist on a regular basis \u2013\u2013 you\u2019re top 10% (of good dental care) no doubt about it, and that\u2019s totally in your control,\u201d Messina said.",

Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nYou might not think twice about spending extended time on your phone around your children, but a new study suggests that parents\u2019 screen-time habits are associated with children accessing more age-inappropriate content.\n\nParental screen usage in front of children and family rules around devices are significantly linked to higher odds of kids watching R-rated movies and playing mature-rated video games, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal BMC Pediatrics.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to explore parent rules and adolescents\u2019 exposure to mature content because there\u2019s a lack of research to guide parents of young adolescents on media use,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, via email. \u201cWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics provides general recommendations for ages 5 to 18, young adolescents are at a unique developmental stage \u2014 they\u2019re not little kids anymore, but they\u2019re also not fully independent teens.\u201d\n\nNagata and other researchers analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, including more than 10,000 adolescents aged 12 to 13.\n\nParents responded to a 14-item questionnaire, rating their agreement with statements such as, \u201cI try to limit how much I use a screen-based device when I am with my child\u201d on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).\n\nAdolescents also self-reported their exposure to mature content by answering two questions, \u201cHow often do you watch R-rated movies?\u201d and \u201cHow often do you play mature-rated video games?\u201d on a scale from 0 (never) to 3 (all the time).\n\nThe study found that with each unit increase in parental screen use \u2014 based on the 1 to 4 scale \u2014 there was an 11% increase in the likelihood of children engaging with both mature video games and R-rated movies.\n\n\u201cThis (study) offers strong encouragement for us as parents to keep on monitoring and limiting our kids\u2019 use of screens, even when doing so is difficult and unpleasant because we get a lot of pushback from our kids,\u201d said CNN contributor Dr. Kara Alaimo, associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey and author of \u201cOver the Influence,\u201d via email.\n\nFrequent screen use during meals and high levels of bedroom screentime in adolescents were also notably associated with increased exposure to mature content, according to the study.\n\nHow parents can limit screen time\n\nFor parents uncertain about navigating their child\u2019s screen time, a good starting point is modeling healthy device habits.\n\nChildren tend to mirror their parents\u2019 behavior, so if adults frequently use their phones, adolescents will be inclined to do the same.\n\n\u201cParents should practice what they preach,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cIf parents make a family rule to not text at the dinner table, they should follow it.\u201d\n\nAlaimo encourages parents to reflect on their own phone usage around their kids, asking whether the activities they do on their phones are truly meaningful or mindless scrolling that provides little value.\n\nWhile she acknowledges it\u2019s not always possible, she also suggests that parents try to spend time on their devices when their children are at school or asleep to maximize quality in-person family time.\n\nIf parents take the time to initiate a conversation around efforts to manage their personal screen time, it can provide more thoughtful and relatable examples for kids to follow, Alaimo said.\n\nNavigating screen-time boundaries with your child\n\nNagata emphasized that adolescent bedroom screen use had the strongest correlation with exposure to mature content. To effectively limit access to inappropriate media, families should establish clear screen rules during meals and before bedtime, he added.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends creating a family media plan to set specific, practical guidelines tailored to each household.\n\nTo initiate device guidelines, parents should promote frequent conversations around appropriate phone use, which can include eliminating any screens during certain times of the day.\n\nSince every family\u2019s media plan will differ, Nagata said it\u2019s important for parents to adjust screen-time rules as children grow. That may include reassessing what content is appropriate, which devices are used and how much time is spent on screens.\n\nThe study also found that using screen time as a punishment often led children to seek out more mature content, which Nagata attributed to adolescents who are craving independence and may react negatively to restrictive measures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that when kids fear that their parents will take away their screens, it can discourage them from coming to their parents when they end up in trouble online and need help \u2014 for example, if they\u2019re being blackmailed for money,\u201d Alaimo said. \u201cTempting though it can be for all of us, this study gives parents another reason to think twice before wielding such punishments.\u201d\n\nHowever, children who were rewarded with screen time tended to consume less mature media. Nagata suggests that positive reinforcement strategies with screens can be effective in encouraging other healthy device habits.",

                "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOften referred to as the world\u2019s most famous medieval artwork, the Bayeux Tapestry is both an intricate illustration of the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and a historical enigma. Several mysteries still surround the dazzling embroidery, including the identity of its maker, but new research may have found another piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe 68.3-meter-long (224-foot-long) tapestry depicts William, Duke of Normandy, and his army killing Harold Godwinson, or Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. While the embroidery\u2019s portrayal of Harold pulling an arrow out of his eye may be a matter of debate, a team of archaeologists says it has confirmed a different detail from Harold\u2019s tapestry scenes: the location of his residence in Bosham, England.\n\nThe team used a combination of traditional and modern techniques to establish the site of the king\u2019s palace, which appears twice in the artwork \u2014 once when Harold is feasting in an extravagant hall before setting sail to France and the second time on his return prior to the battle. The researchers reported their findings January 9 in The Antiquaries Journal.\n\n\u201cWe often just think of (the Bayeux Tapestry) as a piece of artwork, but of course, it\u2019s depicting events and places. And to be able to, with some certainty, locate one of those places from the tapestry on the ground in real life is really exciting,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Dr. Duncan Wright, a senior lecturer in medieval archaeology at Newcastle University in Newcastle, England.\n\nArchaeological remains from this period are hard to come by, said study coauthor Oliver Creighton, a professor of archaeology at England\u2019s University of Exeter. The houses, even for those of high status, were made of timber, and the wood would not have survived. Also, the Norman Conquest likely eradicated most evidence of its predecessors, Creighton added.\n\nThe discovery not only sheds light on the final Anglo-Saxon king, it also provides a rare window into a key turning point in history for England, researchers said.\n\nMedieval toilet and other key clues\n\nBosham is named on the Bayeux Tapestry, but the exact location of Harold\u2019s residence depicted on the embroidery has not been clear. Over the years, archaeologists had a hunch that a large house built in the 17th century, the focal point of the present-day village that exists there, sat on top of where the palace once stood.\n\nTo confirm this location, researchers used a range of methods, such as analysis of standing structures within the current house, ground-penetrating radar to scan and map any buried remains of the medieval palace, and a review of evidence from a 2006 excavation inside the house and the garden.\n\n\u201cPeople often think of archaeology as being all about digging, all about excavation,\u201d Creighton said. \u201c\u2026 But it\u2019s a jigsaw puzzle. It uses lots and lots of different sources.\u201d\n\nThe surveys found two previously unidentified medieval buildings within the house and garden, but a vital clue that helped to date the site and identify the palace was a latrine, or a toilet, discovered in the 2006 excavation. Researchers overlooked the feature at the time; it\u2019s only in the past decade that archaeologists have begun to see a pattern of toilets being placed in elite residences during the Anglo-Saxon period, Wright said.\n\nAnother indicator was the site\u2019s proximity to a church. Elite Anglo-Saxon residences were often built near churches, according to the study, and the site of Harold\u2019s palace was next to an important Anglo-Saxon church in Bosham.\n\nShown here is a medieval sundial that was found built into the upstanding house. Sundials are regularly found in churches dating to the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods. Duncan W Wright/Newcastle University/Where Power Lies\n\n\u201cThese residences and churches together (around the year of 1000 ) are where the aristocracy start to kind of invest in their own kind of displays. They\u2019re showing off to each other, really,\u201d said Wright, who is the principal investigator of the Where Power Lies project, a systematic examination of power centers between the late Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods.\n\n\u201cIn England, loads of these places then become manor houses or castles \u2026 but their origins and how they emerge is pretty poorly understood,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so the main aim of the project was really trying to sort of characterize the archaeology of these really early phases of these places starting out and how they evolve.\u201d\n\nA house fit for a king\n\nHarold\u2019s palace, which was a moated, enclosed site featuring many ancillary buildings, such as stables, granaries, storehouses, kitchens and other accommodations found during the 2006 excavation, is one of seven sites that researchers have examined so far as part of the Where Power Lies effort, said Creighton, who is also the co-investigator of the project. But the Bosham site is particularly special for its connection to the Bayeux Tapestry.\n\n\u201cThe Bayeux Tapestry is integral to the way everyone thinks of Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest. \u2026 But there is a huge amount the embroidery can tell us about the past beyond its representation of military and political events,\u201d said Rory Naismith, a professor of early medieval English history at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\u201cWe can mine it for details about how people lived, including what their world looked like (such as Harold\u2019s hall at Bosham). We can also use it as a way into how people understood and pictured the recent past, which helps us to grasp why this item was made in the first place,\u201d Naismith said in an email.\n\n\u201cThe paper permits something really rare and remarkable: to read about a place and see images of it in sources from the time, and to be able to pinpoint and reconstruct something of it now,\u201d Naismith added. \u201cThis is precisely what brings the past to life. \u2026 It adds texture to the picture we have of Harold and the world he inhabited.\u201d\n\nWithin the Bosham house, archaeologists discovered a few original features from medieval times, including a stone wall directly at the center of the house, wood timbers in the roof, and one of the stairwells, which appears to have been reused from an earlier building.\n\nMedieval tie beam found within the home that exists where Godwinson's residence once stood. Duncan W Wright/Newcastle University/Where Power Lies\n\nMedieval timbers were found within one of the stairwells of the home. Duncan W Wright/Newcastle University/Where Power Lies\n\nThe study\u2019s authors said they do not think these features are from Harold\u2019s palace, but they hope to return sometime this year to perform wood dating to confirm their origins, Wright said. There are no photos of the exterior of the existing house available to the public out of respect for the privacy of the current owners, he added.\n\nHarold\u2019s Bosham palace was not his only home, as both before and after the Norman conquest the elite would often move between estates, but it was likely his favorite due to the large size and lavish features, Creighton said.\n\n\u201cThis news is particularly exciting because it brings together different types of evidence \u2014 the wonderful tapestry, archaeology and medieval written sources,\u201d said Dr. Caitlin Ellis, associate professor in medieval Nordic history at Norway\u2019s University of Oslo, who was not involved with the study.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there is still more to discover about this period by reassessing the evidence. The Bayeux Tapestry is a fascinating slice of history, both visual and textual,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThe Battle of Hastings and the resultant Norman Conquest is seen as a key turning point in English history and identity. It was a time of both change and continuity.\u201d",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nElon Musk and his allies have spent the last two weeks barreling full speed into multiple government agencies, causing confusion and chaos and raising questions about whether an unelected businessman can wield this kind of authority, seemingly running roughshod over laws and programs set up by Congress.\n\nOver the last several days, Musk-aligned personnel have gained full access to the Treasury\u2019s payments system, threatened to shut down the US Agency for International Development, offered all federal employees a sort of \u201cbuyout\u201d plan, and in several agencies, pushed aside career civil servants \u2013 in some cases locking them out of their offices or computers.\n\nTaken together, Musk\u2019s moves represent an unprecedented effort to expand the power of the executive branch with little regard for laws or procedures \u2013 an effort Donald Trump foreshadowed during his successful 2024 campaign. Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts, and now, access to the innermost workings of the federal government.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time thinking of anyone who has exerted the kind of power and control that he has exerted over government operations in the last week,\u201d Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor who specializes in government ethics, told CNN.\n\nThe question of whether Musk will comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules \u2013 and whether the Trump administration will enforce them \u2013 has drawn scrutiny from Democrats and watchdog groups.\n\nMultiple lawsuits are also underway, with more likely to come.\n\nCritics accuse Musk and his allies of running afoul of laws aimed at protecting the security of federal data, while seeking to shrink or outright eliminate agencies in moves that would take an act of Congress.\n\nMusk\u2019s \u2018special\u2019 status\n\nAfter days of silence on the question of Musk\u2019s employment status, the White House on Monday indicated that Musk has been officially serving as a special government employee. That designation means Musk isn\u2019t a volunteer but also not a full-time federal employee.\n\n\u201cSpecial government employees are sort of like super-volunteers. They\u2019re more empowered but less encumbered,\u201d said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of the National Security Counselors, which represents federal employees and whistleblowers and has sued the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency in court.\n\nA special government employee is a temporary position for someone who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period. Musk isn\u2019t being paid, a person familiar with his employment told CNN. He does have an office on the White House campus.\n\n\u201cElon can\u2019t do and won\u2019t do anything without our approval. And we\u2019ll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won\u2019t,\u201d the president said on Monday.\n\nAs a special government employee, Musk is covered by a federal conflicts-of-interest statute that prohibits government employees from participating in matters that would affect their financial interests. That law can be enforced criminally or in the civil context, but it only by the Justice Department \u2013 in this case, Trump\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nIt is unclear whether Musk has formally been appointed the administrator of the US DOGE entity created by a January 20 Trump executive order. The White House press office hasn\u2019t responded to multiple CNN emails seeking that clarification.\n\nSuch an appointment would weigh on whether Musk is obligated under ethics rules to publicly file a financial disclosure form, said Clark. Also relevant to that determination is whether previous occupants of the administrator role \u2013 at the DOGE predecessor agency, the US Digital Service \u2013 were highly ranked enough in government service to fall under a mandated public release of the disclosure form.\n\nThe status of the other DOGE appointees dispersed to federal agencies is also unclear, even to staffers at the agencies. Some are now officially in employee databases and have government emails. Others have been entering agencies under visitor badges. Some staffers have reported having meetings with personnel who identify themselves as part of the political appointee team. WIRED has reported that some of the staffers brought on with political appointees at the Office of Personnel Management appear to be in their early 20s.\n\nTaking over government HR\n\nOPM, the closest equivalent to the federal government\u2019s human resources agency, has been the source of mass emails being sent to all federal employees in recent days urging them to resign and be paid through September. The emails\u2019 subject line \u2013 \u201cA fork in the road\u201d \u2013 matched one that Twitter employees received in 2022 after Musk bought the company.\n\nAnd now the agency that has been trying to encourage mass resignations of federal employees is itself on the chopping block. On Monday, senior staff at OPM had to identify 30% of their workforce they could cut in the near term, with a floated goal of an eventual 70% reduction in staff, according to two sources. Those cuts could significantly impact OPM\u2019s ability to perform its tasks, including benefits, services and oversight.\n\nWhen asked for comment on Friday, an unnamed official replied from OPM\u2019s media relations office with a short email broadly denying CNN\u2019s reporting. The agency didn\u2019t respond when asked follow-up questions or for more specifics.\n\nMusk himself has made several visits to the OPM offices in downtown Washington, DC, sources said. But most alarming for the career civil servants at OPM, multiple sources told CNN, is that the political appointees have cut off nearly all the senior-level career civil servants at the agency.\n\nCareer civil servants at OPM, including those at the senior-most levels, have been physically moved out of their offices in the Office of the Director Annex and onto different floors. Some have also lost access to internal data systems. That has raised many alarms for civil servants concerned that the personal data, including Social Security numbers, of millions of federal employees is at risk.\n\n\u201cThe political team has unfettered access to everything the Office of the Chief Information Officer manages,\u201d a source at the agency told CNN. \u201cMany of the appointees are software engineers who are making back-end changes without regard to federal norms and requirements. They are pulling statutorily required information off OPM.gov.\u201d\n\nThe agency has had strict cybersecurity protocols in place since a 2015 hack of OPM, which compromised sensitive personal information of roughly 21.5 million people from both inside and outside the government. The hack, which US officials have blamed on Chinese spies, forced OPM and other federal agencies to overhaul their cyber defenses.\n\nThe agency now faces a lawsuit, brought by McClanahan\u2019s firm on behalf of two anonymous federal employees, accusing the administration of failing to conduct a required data security assessment when setting up an OPM email distribution system for mass emails to the entire federal civil service.\n\nSome of Musk\u2019s top lieutenants have been working directly at OPM or advising at the agency since the inauguration. They include Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company who helped Musk during the purge of Twitter staffers in 2022, as well as now OPM senior adviser Brian Bjelde, who had been vice president of people operations at SpaceX, and Amanda Scales, now OPM\u2019s chief of staff who until January worked in talent at Musk\u2019s xAI company.\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to run OPM, Scott Kupor, who is awaiting confirmation, also holds deep ties to the Silicon Valley universe integral to Musk\u2019s DOGE operations. Kupor comes from Andreessen Horowitz, the powerhouse tech venture capital shop co-founded by Marc Andreessen. Andreessen, a legend in the tech space, was closely involved in advising Trump\u2019s transition operation.\n\nThe appointed acting director of the agency \u2013 Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Ezell \u2013 was until January, an OPM branch chief for data analytics in Georgia, a jump in seniority that shocked current and former OPM staff.\n\nGoing after USAID\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, top career staffers at USAID \u2013 which Musk has branded a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that should \u201cdie\u201d \u2013 were placed on immediate leave. The entire executive team and every deputy in the agency, which dispenses billions in humanitarian aid and development funding annually, were suddenly gone.\n\nAccording to sources, personnel from the Musk-created office then physically tried to access the USAID headquarters in Washington, DC, and were stopped. The DOGE personnel demanded to be let in and threatened to call US Marshals to be allowed access, two of the sources said.\n\nPeople hold placards outside the USAID building, after billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to shrink the federal government, said work is underway to shut down the U.S. foreign aid agency USAID, in Washington, U.S., February 3, 2025. Kent Nishimura/Reuters\n\nThe DOGE personnel wanted to gain access to USAID security systems and personnel files, three sources said. Two of those sources also said the DOGE personnel wanted access to classified information, which only those with security clearances and a specific need to know are able to access. Eventually they were able to access the headquarters.\n\nOn Sunday night, Musk said Trump had agreed the agency should be shut down. By Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was now acting administrator of USAID. Its website was offline and remaining staff were told to work from home.\n\nBut critics have argued that Trump can\u2019t unilaterally abolish USAID, whose existence is written into federal law and whose budget comes from congressional appropriations.\n\n\u201cThe president has zero legal authority to \u2018shut down,\u2019 defund, or otherwise cripple a $50 billion agency. Audit it, identify unnecessary expenditures, draft reform or rescission proposals, and then go to Congress to PASS A LAW,\u201d Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote on X.\n\nCuts and new faces at GSA\n\nA quiet but similarly consequential Musk-driven mission has been underway at the General Services Administration, which oversees federal real estate and procurement.\n\nThe same day Trump took the oath of office, GSA employees received an email from the newly appointed acting head of the agency that highlighted the need for GSA to commit itself to \u201censuring government-wide efficiency and maximizing value for the American taxpayer,\u201d according to a copy read to CNN.\n\nTrump political appointees at GSA asked career employees to look into purchasing mattresses, washers and dryers in order to extend working hours in the building, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne source said the new equipment was so political appointees could \u201cwork around the clock.\u201d The source added that the political appointees also wanted to extend the idea of sleeping in the federal building to career staff, but they faced internal push back. They were told that \u201cthey could not make career employees sleep in the federal building,\u201d the source said.\n\nA DOGE spokesperson suggested to CNN that it was not true that political appointees had requested mattresses, washers and dryers be purchased for the GSA building. Musk himself has touted bringing mattresses in for DOGE employees. He\u2019s also bragged that DOGE employees are working 120-hour weeks, just as employees have at his private companies.\n\nStephen Ehikian, a former Salesforce executive who most recently worked in AI, was tapped to serve as the agency\u2019s deputy administrator and has taken on the role of acting head of GSA until a Trump nominee is confirmed for the role. The efficiency mandate, Ehikian wrote, was \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n\nEhikian\u2019s email also served as the internal announcement of a series of new appointees across key roles in the agency. They include Thomas Shedd, who is taking over the leadership of the Technology Transformation Services, the essential government unit for the government\u2019s technology products and services.\n\nShedd spent the previous eight years building software for vehicle and battery factories at Tesla, Musk\u2019s car company. His approach in the new role carries echoes of Musk\u2019s private-sector strategies, one of the people familiar with the matter said, citing a Shedd email this week to hundreds of GSA employees to schedule \u201ctouch-base\u201d sessions and bring with them an example of a recent \u201ctechnical win.\u201d\n\nIn addition to managing the federal government\u2019s real estate, GSA manages some of the most massive government contracts.\n\nCritics have questioned the inherent conflict of interest in Musk\u2019s associates working within the GSA, even though they all should have signed nondisclosure agreements. Musk has billions of dollars in government contracts, and one source familiar with the situation noted that some of his closest associates now have access to \u201csensitive and often classified acquisitions information for billions of dollars in government contracts.\u201d\n\nAccording to two sources familiar with the situation at GSA, every office agency must present proposals this week to cut 50% of their business expenses, in addition to the GSA efforts to significantly reduce the federal government\u2019s real estate footprint. GSA is also expected to begin terminating about 3,000 of the \u201csoft term\u201d leases (of nearly 7,000 total leases across the country). Leadership have been advised of a push to cancel 300 leases per day.\n\nThe GSA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nStopping payments at Treasury\n\nLate last week, the DOGE appointees were granted full access to the government\u2019s payments system after the top civil servant at the Treasury Department, David Lebryk, left his job unexpectedly. The DOGE appointees had clashed with Lebryk after they expressed interest in stopping certain payments made by the federal government, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nMusk himself acknowledged his interest in the Treasury Department\u2019s payment processing in a middle-of-the-night post on his social media platform Saturday.\n\nSignage on the exterior of the U.S. Department of the Treasury building, Saturday, Jan. 11, 2025, in Washington. Aaron M. Sprecher/AP\n\nHe wrote his team \u201cdiscovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once.\u201d\n\nThe post appeared to ignore the mechanisms already in place for Treasury to simply fulfill lawful payment decisions made by other agencies, and that the system\u2019s value to the federal bureaucracy and the nation\u2019s economy lies in its reliability.\n\nThe Treasury moves have spurred a lawsuit, filed Monday on behalf of government unions and others, alleging a \u201cmassive and unprecedented\u201d intrusion into private government data.\n\nIt adds to a pile of lawsuits that has grown quickly in the last two weeks, in some cases halting the administration\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this whole mishmash is so troubling,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cThey have managed to break so many rules and so many laws with some fairly simple actions that a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in the media and politicians and everyone get tangled up on. \u2026 You\u2019re basically punching smoke when you\u2019re trying to litigate against this.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Alayna Treene, Jennifer Hansler, Lauren Kent, Alex Marquardt and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFamilies were waiting at the airport to welcome home loved ones when their plane, just minutes from landing, collided midair with a military helicopter in a fiery explosion, plunging 67 lives full of promise into the cold, inky waters of the Potomac River.\n\nThe frantic search for survivors started under the cloak of icy darkness. By morning, the mission had turned into a slow and somber search for the remains of everyone on board.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, 55 bodies have been identified, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said, with the search effort hampered by near-zero visibility in the frigid water, sharp pieces of debris and the mangled metal of the wreckage.\n\nAmid heated political speculation on the cause of Wednesday night\u2019s collision and grief-stricken stories from heartbroken loved ones, hundreds of rescue personnel continue to search relentlessly for the remains of every person lost.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting home and they\u2019re crashing and falling into really deep sleeps, and then getting up and going back to work and doing it again,\u201d David Hoagland, president of the Washington, DC, Firefighters Local 36, told CNN. \u201cHowever long it takes, they\u2019re going to be there.\u201d\n\nDays later, dangerous and difficult conditions persist, hindering the careful and deliberate efforts of crews working to recover the bodies of victims trapped deep within the wreckage, beyond the reach of divers.\n\nThe recovery effort has been extensive, involving nearly every dive team in the area, including the US Coast Guard, the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office dive team, DC Fire and the International Association of Fire Fighters.\n\nHere\u2019s how their efforts are unfolding.\n\nHeavier equipment needed to remove remaining bodies\n\nThe mangled wreckage in the Potomac River has made the recovery effort especially difficult for dive teams, who have struggled to access parts of the plane\u2019s fuselage. These sections will need to be removed to retrieve the remaining bodies, Donnelly said.\n\n\u201cThings have kind of slowed down this weekend because they\u2019re waiting on a lot more heavier salvage equipment that\u2019s going to be showing up sometime in the next 24 to 36 hours,\u201d Hoagland told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be setting up for a pretty complicated operation where they\u2019re going to be removing plane parts from the water on Monday.\u201d\n\nThe wreckage of the American Airlines jet broke apart, according to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. The fuselage was found upside down in three sections in the river, which is about 8 feet deep in some areas.\n\nDivers have been using specialized underwater hydraulic rescue tools capable of cutting metal to try to recover as many victims as possible, Hoagland said.\n\nAsked whether authorities are confident about the location of the remaining bodies, Donnelly said, \u201cWe think we know where they are,\u201d but \u201cwe won\u2019t know until we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that when we remove the aircraft, that that will help us resolve this number,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, we will continue the search.\u201d\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers will start working to remove the remnants of the jet Monday, according to a news release.\n\nThen, engineers will switch their focus to the remnants of the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the collision. They expect to finish removing the wreckage by February 12, the release says.\n\nFirst responders salute as two ambulances carrying the flag-draped bodies of service members killed in the midair collision depart a temporary emergency disaster site at Buzzard Point in Washington, DC, on Friday. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nA US Coast Guard boat equipped with a crane was used Friday to hold the door of the US Army Black Hawk helicopter, allowing for the retrieval of the bodies of all three service members, followed by the \u201cdignified transfer of their remains,\u201d Hoagland said.\n\nThe wreckage of the helicopter was located about 300 yards from the plane debris, according to Hoagland. Most of Friday\u2019s recovery operations focused on the Black Hawk.\n\nRecovery teams are planning to bring a larger crane to the Potomac crash site to help reach victims in a section of the wreckage divers can\u2019t access, a law enforcement source told CNN.\n\nThe crane, used to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its collapse last March, will be employed to cut and lift pieces of the airplane. This will allow divers to safely recover additional victims who are pinned inside and extremely difficult to access.\n\n\u201cWith these really large marine salvage cranes and vessels, as you can imagine, these things are not very seaworthy,\u201d Hoagland said. \u201cThey can\u2019t move very fast because they\u2019ve got giant cranes on them, so it\u2019s slow sail to get up the bay and then into the river to get up to DC.\u201d\n\nRescue teams are also on the water using technology such as sonar scanning to continue their search and deploy divers. Additionally, crews will search sewer lines and conduct aerial operations as dive teams work in targeted areas, according to Donnelly.\n\nDangerous, difficult and risky conditions\n\nWhen a direct line to Reagan National Airport rang Wednesday night, Hoagland said, Local 36 first responders expected a routine report of a flight in distress. Instead, they heard: \u201cCrash! Crash! Crash!\u201d he recalled.\n\nAs union members rushed to a pier to board a fireboat, burning debris rained down on Potomac. First responders arrived to find wreckage submerged in the shallow water and almost immediately started finding victims, Hoagland said.\n\nSome passengers were still strapped to their seats, but removing them proved difficult as sharp pieces of debris tore the wetsuits worn by first responders.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot working against them. They had the current in the river. They had jet fuel all over in the water with them. They had debris. They had ice,\u201d Edward Kelly, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cLike I said, the swift current was a challenge, searching the fuselage \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of sharp objects in the cockpit \u2013 so it was a very difficult and risky and dangerous rescue attempt.\u201d\n\nAt one point, there were close to 50 divers in the water responding to the incident, he said.\n\n\u201cOne thing that was a blessing was the civilian dinner boat in DC did a trip up the Potomac yesterday, which actually broke the ice that allowed the smaller boats to respond to the actual crash last night,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the night of the crash, emergency crews battled icy, choppy waters, Donnelly said.\n\n\u201cThe water is dark, it is murky, and that is a very tough condition for them to dive in. If you can imagine, the river is a large black spot at night with no lights on it, except for a few buoy lights,\u201d Donnelly said.\n\nDC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly speaks during a news conference at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday. Al Drago/Getty Images\n\nFriday, search crews continued to exercise caution as weather conditions posed challenges for recovery efforts, Donnelly said. Divers faced intense mud and near-zero visibility, despite the aircraft resting in only a few feet of water.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually part of the challenge, is that you\u2019re half swimming, half walking while you\u2019re working. This is very strenuous for our divers or rescue swimmers that are in the water,\u201d Donnelly said, referring to the silt at the bottom.\n\nSaturday, calmer weather \u2014 with sunshine and fewer winds \u2014 helped with visibility, but ice and debris remained critical hazards, Hoagland told CNN. He added officials are still in the process of mapping the debris field.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s a recovery operation, it\u2019s much more important to preserve evidence so they can investigate the crash, so they\u2019re going to go about it systematically, methodically and intentionally,\u201d Hoagland said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a good job of cataloging and mapping everything by sonar and figuring out where everything is, but it\u2019s a tedious, long effort.\u201d\n\nWith the operation shifted from a rescue to a recovery mission, responders are adopting an approach that prioritizes safety, according to Kelly. For instance, responders will not perform dangerous night dives.\n\nAn emergency response team with DC Fire and EMS and DC Police loads diving equipment on a boat to continue working the scene of the crash in the Potomac River in Arlington, Virginia, on Thursday, Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nMental health counselors available to assist first responders struggling\n\nFirst responders and emergency personnel, who have been working around the clock for days \u2014 first desperately searching for survivors, and now recovering remains \u2014 are exhausted, Hoagland said, but remain resilient.\n\n\u201cEverybody just really wants to see things through,\u201d Hoagland told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re looking out for each other, and everybody\u2019s getting breaks.\u201d\n\nRecovering the bodies and remains of the victims, especially the children, has been both harrowing and exhausting, Hoagland said, a process that will likely leave a lasting emotional and mental impact on first responders.\n\nTo support first responders dealing with the trauma of what they\u2019re witnessing on the scene, the International Association of Fire Fighters has deployed teams of former firefighters trained as mental health counselors to assist with ongoing recovery efforts.\n\n\u201cIf somebody\u2019s really just having a tough time and they need to hit the pause button, they can talk to them and help them decompress and process all the trauma they might be experiencing,\u201d Hoagland said.\n\nThere are enough teams on the ground for everyone to provide each other with peer support and take someone\u2019s place if they are overwhelmed and need a break, Hoagland said.\n\nDonnelly also emphasized the importance of making sure personnel \u201cunderstand that the feelings they have are normal and how to get help if there\u2019s any feelings that aren\u2019t going away, the signs and symptoms, if you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, if you aren\u2019t eating well, we don\u2019t want you to drink, we don\u2019t want you arguing with your family,\u201d he said in a news conference Sunday.\n\nThe US Coast Guard has Critical Incident Stress Management therapists and chaplains who are waiting for US Coast Guard crews to return to home base and will provide them with mental health support immediately, the agency\u2019s Capt. Patrick Burkett said at the news conference.\n\n\u201cThis is not normal, and it\u2019s OK for them to not feel OK,\u201d Burkett said.\n\n\u201cThis is a tragedy,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cWe are in a business where we deal with the loss of life or people being hurt and one person is bad, and it\u2019s hard \u2014 and 67 is a lot.\u201d\n\nNTSB to start investigation after recovery mission is complete\n\nThe US Coast Guard investigates aircraft wreckage on the Potomac River in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Petty Officer 1st Class Brandon Giles/US Coast Guard/Getty Images\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will allow first responders to complete their work before beginning its investigation into the collision, the board\u2019s chair said Thursday.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer L. Homendy described it as an \u201call-hands-on-deck event.\u201d The NTSB had a full crew on the scene Thursday, with about 50 people at the crash site and additional personnel at the agency\u2019s headquarters and labs across the country ready to assist.\n\nBut first, \u201cwe allow the responders to do their important safety mission, which in this case was search and rescue and recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stand back to allow them to do their important safety mission.\u201d\n\nHomendy emphasized the NTSB will \u201cleave no stone unturned in this investigation\u201d and that it will be a \u201cwhole-of-government effort.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez, Chelsea Bailey, Gabe Cohen, Emma Tucker, Rashard Rose, Elise Hammond and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe American Airlines flight involved in the deadly collision with a Black Hawk helicopter over Washington, DC, seemed to increase its pitch just before the impact, preliminary data from a data recorder recovered from the plane shows.\n\n\u201cAt one point very close to the impact, there was a slight change in pitch, an increase in pitch,\u201d National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said at a Saturday evening news conference. \u201cThat is something that we will get you more detail on.\u201d\n\nThe finding is one of the first pieces of information that have emerged as the NTSB works to investigate the disaster in which 67 people are thought to have been killed. The Black Hawk helicopter was training to evacuate government officials in the event of a catastrophe when the collision with the passenger jet occurred.\n\nThe agency is still working to transcribe the entirety of the audio from voice recorders, Brice Banning, the NTSB investigator-in-charge, said.\n\nPreliminary findings announced at the news conference indicate the helicopter may have been flying above the altitude allowed in the corridor. Initial data shows the American Airlines regional plane was flying at around 325 feet, plus or minus 25 feet, at the time of the impact, according to Inman.\n\nBut the data available to the air traffic controllers showed the helicopter was at 200 feet near the time of the accident, Inman said, an unexplained discrepancy that will need further investigation.\n\nIf the impact did take place at 325 feet, it would have been well above the 200-feet limit to which helicopters are restricted in the corridor. The helicopter was using specialized corridors for law enforcement, medevac, military and government helicopters in the Washington area. Federal Aviation Administration charts show \u2013 and the NTSB confirmed \u2013 helicopters in the corridor must be at or below 200 feet above sea level.\n\nInman noted that investigators \u201ccurrently don\u2019t have the readout from the Black Hawk\u201d so they cannot provide information about what altitude the helicopter was flying at. But \u201cobviously an impact occurred, and I would say when an impact occurs, that is typically where the altitude of both aircraft were at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nFlight tracking data from the moments before the fatal midair collision appear to show the helicopter flying 100 feet above its allowed altitude, and veering off the prescribed route along the Potomac River\u2019s east side.\n\nBoth President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have raised the issue of altitude.\n\n\u201cThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high, by a lot. It was far above the 200 foot limit,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post Friday.\n\n\u201cSomeone was at the wrong altitude,\u201d Hegseth told Fox News on Friday morning. \u201cWas the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now, we don\u2019t quite know.\u201d\n\nThe helicopter\u2019s black box voice recorder has also been recovered with no signs of exterior damage, according to Inman.\n\nThe NTSB has begun interviewing air traffic control personnel, which will continue for a few days, Inman said.\n\nThe slight increase in pitch could show the pilots trying to pull the plane up after suddenly noticing the helicopter, Mary Schiavo, former inspector general at the Department of Transportation, told CNN Saturday.\n\n\u201cThat tells us that they did not see the helicopter until just, you know, a second at impact,\u201d Schiavo said. \u201cBut they had that one second to try to pull up.\u201d\n\nThe discrepancy between the plane\u2019s altitude and the helicopter altitude as reported by the air traffic controllers \u201cis going to be the source of a lot of investigation,\u201d Schiavo added.\n\nHelicopter on training flight for emergencies\n\nAt the time of the collision, the Black Hawk military helicopter was training to evacuate government officials in the case of a catastrophic event.\n\nThe pilots were training for a scenario when \u201csomething really bad happens in this area, and we need to move our senior leaders,\u201d Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for the Army\u2019s aviation directorate, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThat evacuation would be part of what Hegseth described as \u201ca continuity of government mission.\u201d\n\nTo carry out such an evacuation, Koziol added, pilots \u201cdo need to be able to understand the environment, the air traffic, the routes, to ensure the safe travel of our senior leaders throughout our government.\u201d\n\nThose who were killed included three Army aviators in the Black Hawk: Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, who was identified Saturday; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Lloyd Eaves, 39. While the Army released the names of the other two soldiers on board the Black Hawk on Friday, Lobach\u2019s name had been withheld at her family\u2019s request.\n\nPilots who fly with the 12th Aviation Battalion, based out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, frequently fly along the Potomac River and past DC\u2019s Reagan National Airport for various missions \u2013 often carrying general officers or Army leaders to and from the Pentagon, or other VIPs elsewhere in the Northeast.\n\nBrad Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot and member of the 12th Aviation Battalion who served on September 11, 2001, told CNN that on the route past Reagan, the helicopters drop down to their lowest altitude of the entire flight, with the intention of getting low to \u201cdeconflict with aircraft at Reagan.\u201d\n\n\u201c(T)he low level helicopter routes have been in operation for decades \u2013 that area is one of the busiest aviation operation centers in the country, if not the world,\u201d said Bowman, who is also a senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cIt is a concert or orchestra of activity that requires careful communication and cooperation between pilots and Reagan tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has to be on their game and follow instruction exactly,\u201d Bowman added.\n\nMeanwhile, reports have emerged that may show the tragedy is part of a larger problem. In the three years before the disaster, at least two other pilots near misses collisions with helicopters while landing at Reagan National Airport.\n\nFor years, Sen. Tim Kaine has been a vocal critic of congestion at the airport, warning it was only a matter of time before there was a deadly collision.\n\n\u201cWe got to get to the bottom of this crash and then take necessary steps to keep people safe,\u201d the Virginia Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nThe inadequate staffing at the Reagan airport tower was also hardly an anomaly. Airports around the country have struggled with controller staffing levels for years, according to a CNN review of government data and interviews with aviation experts.\n\nThe Trump administration is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to increase staffing levels of air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to surge air traffic controllers. We\u2019re going to bring in the best and the brightest,\u201d Duffy told Tapper on Sunday.\n\nBut the yearslong training process for certified air traffic controllers means the increase in staffing won\u2019t happen overnight, Duffy said.\n\nA bouquet of flowers sits on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, DC, on Thursday. Bryan Dozier/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nHistoric disaster\n\nThe midair collision between the Army Black Hawk helicopter and American Eagle Flight 5342 near DC\u2019s Reagan National Airport marks the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.\n\nCrews are still working to recover the wreckage of the aircraft and bodies of the victims from the Potomac River. The victims include a number of young figure skaters returning from a development camp in Kansas, as well as three soldiers who were aboard the Black Hawk.\n\nThe NTSB is investigating the devastating crash and will take about 30 days to release a preliminary report. A final report, which will determine a probable cause, will take much longer, the board said.\n\nForty-two bodies have been recovered from the scene of the wreckage of the deadly midair collision over the Potomac River, authorities said Saturday.\n\n\u201cRescue crews have recovered 42 sets of remains and 38 have been positively identified by the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,\u201d Unified Command said in a statement Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Black Hawk helicopter, while briefly stabilized to assist with recovery efforts, remains in the water, authorities said.\n\n\u201cToday, salvage crews from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Supervisor of Salvage and Diving are assessing the area and preparing for the recovery of the aircraft,\u201d a statement from emergency services reads.\n\n\u201cDivers from the salvage company are surveying the wreckage throughout the day. Additional barges and equipment are expected to arrive later this afternoon. No wreckage is expected to be removed on Saturday,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nDC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly Sr. previously said he believed it was necessary to remove the fuselage of the plane from the water in order to recover all the bodies.\n\nAsked on Friday if authorities are confident they know where the remaining bodies are, Donnelly said, \u201cwe think we know where they are,\u201d but \u201cwe won\u2019t know until we\u2019re done.\u201d",

                "text": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. AP \u2014\n\nA federal judge on Friday refused to stop what would be the fourth nitrogen gas execution in the U.S., saying the inmate had not proven his claims that the new method is unconstitutionally cruel and causes psychological terror.\n\nChief District Judge Emily C. Marks rejected Demetrius Frazier\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to either stop his execution on Thursday in Alabama or require that the state give him a sedative before administering the gas.\n\nMarks ruled Frazier had not met the \u201cexceedingly high\u201d legal bar required to win an injunction.\n\n\u201cFrazier fails to meet his burden to establish that the Protocol does create a substantial risk of serious psychological pain such that the Protocol violates the Eighth Amendment,\u201d Marks wrote.\n\nFrazier is scheduled to be executed for the 1991 rape of murder of Pauline Brown. Prosecutors said Frazier broke into Brown\u2019s Birmingham apartment, raped her and shot her in the back of the head.\n\nAlabama became the first state to carry out executions with nitrogen gas when three inmates were put to death using the new method in 2024. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.\n\nFrazier\u2019s lawyers pointed to descriptions of the state\u2019s first three nitrogen executions to argue the method causes conscious suffocation instead of the swift death that the state promised.\n\nDr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner and that Grayson appeared conscious for up to three minutes.\n\nMedia witnesses, including The Associated Press, described how the men shook on the gurney at the start of their executions.\n\nMarks ruled that the descriptions do not support a finding that any of the men \u201cexperienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\u201d The state has maintained the movements by the inmates may have been involuntary or faked.\n\nHowever, the judge noted there could be a point that depriving an inmate of oxygen while conscious is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the State\u2019s stubborn refusal at the evidentiary hearing to concede this point, the longer an inmate remains conscious while breathing in nitrogen during an execution, the more likely it becomes that the Eighth Amendment may be violated,\u201d Marks wrote.\n\nBefore his conviction in Alabama, Frazier was convicted in Michigan for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. He was sentenced to life in prison. Michigan does not have the death penalty.\n\nFrazier\u2019s mother made a last-minute plea to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to intervene and request that Frazier be sent back to Michigan to serve the life sentence instead of being executed in Alabama.\n\n\u201cPlease bring my son back to Michigan. Please don\u2019t let Alabama kill my son if you can stop it,\u201d Carol Frazier wrote in the letter to Whitmer.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s office declined to comment on the request.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSeven people are dead, including one in a car on the ground, after a twin-engine medevac jet carrying a child patient and her mother crashed in a neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia Friday night, the mayor said Saturday morning. At least 19 were injured on the ground.\n\nThe six people on the plane were Mexican nationals, Mexico\u2019s president said Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cI mourn the death of six Mexicans in the plane crash in Philadelphia, United States,\u201d Claudia Sheinbaum said. \u201cThe consular authorities are in permanent contact with the families; I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to support them in whatever way is required. My solidarity with their loved ones and friends.\u201d\n\nThe plane crash, about 150 miles to the northeast of the Washington, DC, area, came as authorities continue their probe into Wednesday\u2019s deadly collision there. An American Airlines regional jet carrying 64 people and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter with three soldiers onboard collided over the Potomac River. All are presumed dead.\n\nThe Learjet 55 crashed after departing from Northeast Philadelphia Airport en route to Springfield-Branson National Airport in Missouri, the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN.\n\nOn board were a pediatric patient and her mother returning home to Mexico after the child had been treated in Philadelphia, said Shai Gold, spokesperson for flight operator Jet Rescue Air Ambulance. The girl was being treated for an illness at Shriners Children\u2019s Hospital in northeast Philadelphia, city officials said Saturday.\n\nFour crew members \u2013 a pilot, co-pilot, paramedic and doctor \u2013 were also on board the flight, which was scheduled to stop for refueling at the Springfield airport before continuing to its final destination of Tijuana, Mexico, Gold told CNN.\n\n\u201cWith air travel we know that you have a risk to the folks in the airplane, but as we saw in Philadelphia, what happens on the ground can be catastrophic,\u201d Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy told CNN Sunday.\n\nOfficials won\u2019t know much about what went wrong until investigators recover the plane\u2019s black box, Duffy said.\n\nInvestigators were still searching Saturday for the jet\u2019s cockpit voice recorder as they worked to collect evidence and piece together what may have led to the crash, according to National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy.\n\n\u201cIt could be intact, but likely\u2026it is damaged, it may be fragmented,\u201d Homendy said at a Saturday news conference.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible team at our headquarters, our Office of Research and Engineering, who have significant expertise on repairing damaged cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders,\u201d Homendy said.\n\nAs part of the evidence gathering process, the board is also collecting debris from the site of the crash and have located the aircraft\u2019s two engines. Homendy asked community members who find debris to reach out to the NTSB.\n\nThe area of impact from the crash is roughly four to six blocks, and officials have discovered debris around the city, Philadelphia\u2019s managing director Adam Thiel said at a news conference earlier Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s a very widespread area and we\u2019re still trying to determine the entire scope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible there will be changes to those casualty figures,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cIt will likely be days or more until we are able to definitively answer the question about the number of folks who perished in this tragedy.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker urged residents who may have been in the area during the explosion to check their vehicles and property for potential evidence.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it, just call 911,\u201d she said.\n\nThe plane took off just after 6 p.m. ET and reached 1,650 feet before plunging, according to data from ADS-B Exchange. The data shows the final speed of descent was 11,000 feet per minute.\n\n\u201cThe entire flight lasted less than a minute,\u201d Ralph Hicks, a senior NTSB investigator, said Saturday.\n\nInvestigators work the scene on Saturday after a small plane crashed in Philadelphia Friday night. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nFirefighters climb up on a roof near the scene of the plane crash on Saturday. Matt Rourke/AP\n\n\u2018We have a lost aircraft\u2019\n\nAs an air traffic controller tried to contact the plane, there was a callout heard on LiveATC.net: \u201cMedevac med service, northeast tower. Medevac med service, northeast tower. Are you on frequency?\u201d\n\nA little over a minute later, the controller is heard saying: \u201cWe have a lost aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe medical transport plane crashed in a residential neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia, engulfing five homes and multiple vehicles in flames and covering the area with debris, city officials said.\n\nMore than 150 firefighters rushed to the scene after three alarms quickly went off. Video from CNN affiliate WPVI showed flames and a large cloud of smoke in the neighborhood as several fire trucks responded to the crash.\n\nJefferson Health received 15 victims after the crash, a spokesperson said. Twelve have since been discharged, two have been admitted for further care and one patient was transferred to another hospital.\n\nSix patients were sent to Temple University Hospital-Jeanes Campus and all have since been released as of Saturday afternoon, a spokesperson from the hospital confirmed to CNN.\n\nSt. Christopher\u2019s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia received one pediatric patient from Friday\u2019s crash, a spokesperson told CNN.\n\nNearby, the Northeast Philadelphia Airport was temporarily closed following the crash, but is now reopened, the airport told CNN.\n\nAcross the street from the crash, Roosevelt Mall was evacuated, mall spokesperson Kristen Moore told CNN. There were no injuries or damage at the mall, she said.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he is offering all Commonwealth resources as the emergency response unfolds. Sen. John Fetterman also wrote on social media that he was in touch with the Philadelphia mayor and awaiting further information.\n\nSen. Dave McCormick said he is \u201cclosely monitoring the tragic situation,\u201d adding that he has reached out to the mayor and local law enforcement to lend \u201cfull support.\u201d\n\nMembers of the state\u2019s emergency management agency and transportation department are on the ground, along with 45 state troopers, Shapiro told reporters Friday night. The state\u2019s environmental protection department is also making sure that hazardous materials \u201care addressed,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks to the press Friday alongside Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters\n\nDebris of the aircraft lies on the ground. Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters\n\n\u201cThe impact was so devastating, I think they\u2019re going to have their hands full,\u201d Peter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told CNN Saturday.\n\nWhile there\u2019s some video available of the incident, none of it so far is particularly clear, Goelz said.\n\n\u201cThe only tip-off might be if something came off the plane earlier and is a little further down the flight track,\u201d Goelz said. \u201cThat might help indicate what happened, because the first piece off is the most important.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on the crash, Duffy said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cSo sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post. \u201cMore innocent souls lost. Our people are totally engaged. First Responders are already being given credit for doing a great job.\u201d\n\n\u2018Big ball of flames in the sky\u2019\n\nOne witness who saw the crash was at work when he noticed \u201cthis big ball of flames in the sky,\u201d he told CNN affiliate WPVI.\n\n\u201cI was right here at the job and all I could see is this big ball of flames in the sky. Literally, we heard a loud, loud bang. It shook the entire building, the whole building shook,\u201d Mikey Littlejohn told WPVI.\n\nAnother witness, Vadim Osipov, said: \u201cI was in shock. I\u2019m still in shock. Like, this is insane.\u201d\n\nOsipov said the incident reminded him of the war in Ukraine, where he is from. \u201cThere\u2019s always rockets coming in and stuff like that, then I see things flying.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia City Commissioner Lisa Deeley said there were \u201cno words\u201d to describe the troubling videos and images coming out of her neighborhood.\n\n\u201cA tragic plane crash occurred half a mile from the home where I grew up, lived in for over 50 years, and where I am still an active member of the community,\u201d Deeley said in a statement Saturday afternoon. \u201cAn office building where I worked for 10 years appears to have been damaged. I saw debris in the parking lot of the mall where I hung out as a teenager. I can say that you see these things on TV, but it is totally different when it is in your own backyard.\u201d\n\nFirst responders work the scene after a plane crash in Philadelphia on Friday. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nGov. Shapiro said that while Friday\u2019s incident was \u201can awful aviation disaster,\u201d it shows the unified response of local, state and federal officials.\n\n\u201cWe saw neighbor helping neighbor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that there will be loss in this region and we want to offer our thoughts and our serious prayers for those who are grieving.\u201d\n\nRed Cross Philadelphia said a team of disaster workers is on the scene to assist those who have been displaced. Mayor Parker said shelter is available for residents who have been affected.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

No one was hurt, but as West's Tony Atkins reports, *** lot of people are confused about what exactly happened this afternoon. It's the last thing you expect to see on *** warm day like today, *** large chunk of ice coming crashing down through the roof of *** home. Investigators are trying to figure out what happened. Today is very warm. Um, I don't know. It's an unusual sight, *** gaping hole in the roof of this palm cos house after *** piece of ice fell from the sky. Oh my goodness. Here you can see much of that broken ice tucked into *** crevice of the house. Palm Co's police say several pieces fell scattering across the roadway just after 3:30 Monday afternoon. Investigators say one piece penetrated the roof and went into the living area of the house, and fortunately no one was hurt. The family inside is able to stay there. Night officials say they did not want to speak on camera. It's *** really big hole, really. As for where the chunks of ice came from, investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of that. But chunks of ice like this falling from the sky has been blamed on planes in the past. While it is rare, ice can form on the outside of the aircraft, while Cruising at high altitudes as the plane descends into warmer air, these chunks can break away and fall to the ground. We checked flight radar and as you can see, Seattle Trail lies right under multiple flight paths with the planes dropping from 30 to 20,000 ft as they come into MCO. And why planes aren't allowed to Inject toilet waste while in the air. Leaks can happen and can cause what's called blue ice. And since the ice fell on that home, investigators say *** blue tarp was put up to protect the property again and fortunately no one was hurt that was inside.

Last year, Chinese scientists found water in soil samples from the Chang\u2019e-5 lunar probe, while NASA and Indian spacecraft have previously spotted what they believe to be water on the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nBut some scientists believe only ice \u2013 thought to be preserved deep in craters on the moon\u2019s far side \u2013 could potentially support future lunar missions as a water source for astronauts.\n\nAnd the search for lunar ice is part of China\u2019s preparations to build a research base at the moon\u2019s south pole, Chinese space experts told state broadcaster CCTV.\n\n\u201cThere are some very deep caves at the south pole of the moon, and we think there may be water there,\u201d Wu Weiren, chief designer of China\u2019s Lunar Exploration Project, told CCTV. \u201cWe hope the flying detector can conduct on-site inspections into one or two caves after landing.\u201d\n\nFinding ice deposits could potentially help sustain human life on the moon one day, the Chinese experts said, adding it would significantly reduce the cost of space missions \u2013 and suggest the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\nOther experts have previously told CNN that though discoveries of lunar water open doors for future exploration, we can\u2019t yet use those findings to plant crops on the moon or extract drinkable water; these depend on many factors such as how abundant the water is, and the chemical form they take.\n\nFlying robot\n\nThe China National Space Administration has in recent years carried out a series of increasingly complex robotic lunar missions, including the first-ever return of lunar samples from the far side of the moon last year.\n\nIt has been angling to become the second country to land astronauts on the moon, saying its first crewed mission will take place \u201cby 2030.\u201d\n\nUnder that plan, the Chang\u2019e-7 mission scheduled for 2026 aims to carry out the most detailed survey of the lunar south pole, using an orbiter, a lander, a rover \u2013 and the flying detector.\n\nThe flying robot can bend its legs and land in a similar way to humans jumping from a height, the Chinese experts told state media, though the reports did not specify how many legs it has.\n\nThe device is expected to carry out at least three leaps from sunlit areas to shadowed craters to conduct detailed analyses and potentially determine the location, quantity and distribution of ice, the experts added.\n\nStudies have shown that lunar ice is in the darkest and coldest areas at the poles, in shadows of craters where sunlight never reaches due to the tilt of the moon\u2019s axis. The warmest temperatures in these areas don\u2019t go above negative-250 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nTang Yuhua, deputy chief designer of the Chang\u2019e-7 mission, said those harsh conditions would severely test the flying robot.\n\n\u201cTo work for a long time under these circumstances is a big challenge,\u201d he told state media.\n\nCNN\u2019s Simone McCarthy, Jessie Yeung and Ashley Strickland contributed reporting.",

The vote was mostly along party lines though Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania joined Republicans in supporting Bondi.\n\nFetterman told reporters after the vote that he decided to support Bondi because of her qualifications, even though she is not his \u201cideal\u201d choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that she\u2019s, she\u2019s qualified, and it\u2019s not my ideal pick, but it turns out that (former Attorney General) Merrick Garland wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s ideal one either,\u201d he said.\n\nBondi was Trump\u2019s second pick to lead the Justice Department, after former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida withdrew due to a lack of support from GOP senators.\n\nBondi\u2019s nomination was approved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with a 12-10 vote last week. During her confirmation hearing, Bondi blasted the \u201cweaponization\u201d of then-President Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department and said that she would not improperly target people with criminal probes like those against Trump.\n\nShe also told lawmakers that she accepts Trump lost the 2020 election, but falsely claimed at her confirmation hearing that \u201cthere was a peaceful transition of power\u201d that year, ignoring the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that disrupted the election certification.\n\nBondi is known for her battles in court for conservative causes. She prosecuted several high-profile cases during more than a decade as a state attorney. She was elected in 2011 to her first political position \u2013 Florida attorney general \u2013 and was the first woman to hold that office. During that time, Bondi had a reputation for being a media-savvy and effective litigator.\n\nWhile her cases often handled hot-button issues, Bondi herself landed in the headlines for her political maneuvers, as she grew increasingly partisan during her two terms in office.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Bondi became a top Florida surrogate for the Trump campaign, and her support for the president has not wavered. When Trump was first impeached, Bondi joined the defense team for his trial in the Senate and baselessly accused then-private citizen Joe Biden of corrupt business dealings with his son Hunter.\n\nSince leaving the Florida attorney general post in 2019, Bondi has worked at Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles.",

Previous interventions, including truce agreements, failed to cease hostilities.\n\nDR Congo\u2019s military spokesperson, General Sylvain Ekenge, told CNN Tuesday that the rebels\u2019 call for a ceasefire was not genuine.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the Rwandans do what they say? It (the ceasefire announcement by the rebels) is a communication for international consumption and to put the international community to sleep on its feet,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers of the Congolese Red Cross and Civil Protection unload the bodies of victims of the recent clashes in Goma on February 3. Alexis Huguet/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnited Nations experts also estimate that up to 3,000-4,000 Rwandan soldiers are supervising and supporting M23 fighters in the east of the DRC, outnumbering the rebel group\u2019s forces in the country.\n\nLast week, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi vowed \u201ca vigorous and coordinated response\u201d against M23, describing the group as Rwanda\u2019s \u201cpuppet.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN he didn\u2019t know if his country\u2019s troops are in eastern DR Congo.\n\nFighting erupted last week as the rebels advanced into Goma, the capital of DRC\u2019s North Kivu province.\n\nMore than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as the military governor of North Kivu, were killed trying to fend off the rebels, and thousands of locals were displaced.\n\nAccording to the UN\u2019s latest figures, at least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma, and around 2,880 injuries have been recorded since the end of January. A report by the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said many healthcare facilities are overcrowded and in urgent need of medicine and equipment.\n\nGoma residents watch the Congolese Red Cross and the Civilian Protection burying dozens of bodies in a cemetery on Monday. Alexis Huguet/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe rebel alliance emphasized it has \u201cno intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas,\u201d referring to the capital city of the neighboring South Kivu province, where many displaced people from Goma had fled.\n\n\u201cHowever, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,\u201d it said.\n\nThe group\u2019s recent communication appears to sharply shift its stance from capturing more territories. AFC spokesman, Victor Tesongo told CNN Friday that the rebels were working to \u201cinstall a new administration\u201d in Goma and further march on to capture more cities, including South Kivu and the national capital Kinshasa.\n\nMembers of the M23 armed group ride in a pickup truck during a patrol in Goma on January 29. AFP/Getty Images\n\nRebel leader Corneille Nangaa also told Rwandan media last week that his group\u2019s objective was \u201cto go to Kinshasa.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight until we get to Kinshasa. We have come to Goma to stay; we are not going to withdraw. We are going to move forward from Goma to Bukavu \u2026 up to Kinshasa,\u201d he said.",

I\u2019d say 100%,\u201d he continued.\n\nAt least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma since violence erupted, according to the United Nations\u2019 latest figures. \u201cAs of 31 January, at least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets,\u201d said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in a report Monday, citing the World Health Organization.\n\nKagame\u2019s stance was reiterated by the rebel group, whose spokesperson Victor Tesongo told CNN that it \u201creceives no support from Rwanda,\u201d describing the assumption as \u201ca manipulation of public opinion to disqualify us.\u201d\n\nTesongo claimed that Rwanda was more concerned about \u201cits fight against the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) which are allied to the Congolese government which uses them against the security of Rwanda.\u201d\n\nDRC communications minister, Patrick Muyaya, told CNN Monday that Rwanda\u2019s military presence in his country was well documented, saying, \u201cKagame is the only voice denying this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past 10 days, the UN Group of Experts, the UN Security Council, the UN Secretary-General, President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o (of Angola), and SADC (the Southern African Development Community) have all confirmed Rwanda\u2019s military presence in eastern DRC. Kagame is the only voice denying this,\u201d Muyaya said in his response to Kagame\u2019s CNN interview, adding that \u201cthe overwhelming international consensus leaves no doubt.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Larry Madowo told Kagame that comparisons have been made between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who backed local separatist forces to try and invade Donbas, an eastern region of Ukraine, in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere will be so many stories,\u201d Kagame said of the comparison, adding that he can\u2019t \u201cstop people from saying whatever they want to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be called anything - what can I do about it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe have to do what we have to do\u2026 we have to make sure we survive any storm that blows across our country.\u201d\n\nKagame called the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), one of the largest foreign armed groups operating in the DRC, an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Rwanda. He alleged that the group was fully integrated into the Congolese armed forces, suggesting that other governments in the region also support the rebel group.\n\nThe M23 rebel group has said it has seized control of the city of Goma in eastern DRC, and is reportedly advancing south. Daniel Buuma/Getty Images\n\nKagame repeatedly insisted that Rwanda will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to protect itself, without giving much information about what this entails.\n\n\u201cNobody,\u201d including the United Nations or the international community \u201cis going to do it for us,\u201d the leader said.\n\nWhen asked again if he was sending troops to the DRC, Kagame said that Rwanda will do \u201canything to protect itself,\u201d telling Madowo to \u201cread whatever you want to read from what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\nThe simmering conflict between Rwanda and the DRC, which share a border, has since exploded following the M23\u2019s advance into Goma.\n\nRwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told CNN that, as of Monday, 16 people have been killed in Rwanda \u201cduring the shelling from the fighting in Goma.\u201d\n\nLast week, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi vowed \u201ca vigorous and coordinated response\u201d against M23, describing the group as Rwanda\u2019s \u201cpuppet.\u201d\n\nThe rebel alliance told CNN it was working to \u201cinstall a new administration\u201d in Goma and would march on to capture more territories, including the neighboring South Kivu province and the national capital Kinshasa.\n\n\u201cEffectively our struggle cannot be limited to Goma, the objective remains to overthrow Tshisekedi and to install a new leadership capable of finding solutions to the problems faced by our people,\u201d its spokesperson Tesongo said.",

                "text": "Berlin CNN \u2014\n\nAs Germany enters the final few weeks of its election campaign, the man poised to be the next chancellor has doubled down on tightening the country\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 shifting the nation to the right.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in Berlin following his Christian Democratic Party\u2019s (CDU) convention, Friedrich Merz said he would \u201ccontrol [Germany\u2019s] borders and return those who are coming without documents,\u201d if elected.\n\nMerz and the Union party, comprised of the CDU and their Bavarian sister party the CSU, lead the polls with 30% of the vote.\n\nLast week, Merz, a former investment banker at BlackRock with a pilot\u2019s license, also made migration the focus of his campaign. The German lawmaker brought forward two pieces of legislation severely curbing migration. While the non-binding bill passed by a small majority, the binding \u201cInflux Limitation Act\u201d failed. Ahead of that Friday vote Merz told fellow parliamentarians, \u201cthe door to hell, we can still close together\u201d.\n\nNotably, among those who voted against the bill, were members of Merz\u2019s own party.\n\nGermany has seen a spate of recent attacks perpetrated by migrants that has catapulted the issue to the center of the election campaign.\n\nIn January an attack in Aschaffenburg left two people dead, including a two-year old boy. The attacker was an Afghan migrant. Just before Christmas six people were killed in Magdeburg after a Saudi-origin migrant drove a car through a Christmas market.\n\nPeople look at flowers and candles on December 22, 2024, near a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, where a man had driven a car into a crowd. Annegret Hilse/Reuters\n\nMerz dismissed his party\u2019s role in the bill\u2019s failure. Instead, he looked to deflect the blame on to the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD), headed by current chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\n\u201cThis legislation was something which we had agreed with the Social Democrats before in our government in 2018. This is something which they had laid down in their election program,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo in my view, they could have agreed with what we proposed. And my guess is that they will do so after the election\u201d.\n\nBut that does not tell the whole story of a tumultuous week for Merz.\n\nThere is an unwritten agreement between Germany\u2019s largest parties that they would never seek the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to pass laws or legislation \u2013 it\u2019s known as the firewall. Working with the far-right is a taboo in German politics.\n\nLast week Merz made it clear that he did not mind if the AfD voted for his proposals on curbing migration. The far-right party voted on both pieces of legislation Merz proposed, helping push the non-binding bill over the line, a risky gambit that prompted hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets.\n\nBut Merz reiterated to CNN that working with the AfD was a non-starter.\n\n\u201cThey are against\u2026 everything [that] we are, what we build up in the Federal Republic of Germany. There is no co-operation with this party\u201d, he told CNN.\n\nOn the issue of Elon Musk, who has become a feature of this election cycle, Merz said \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate what he is doing, but he is doing something which he is free to do\u201d. Musk has been controversially inserting himself into the German election campaign in favor of the AfD.\n\n\u201cEuropean level\u201d response to Trump\n\nTaking note of US President Donald Trump\u2019s economic measures against some of the US\u2019s closest allies, Merz was clear that any tariffs placed on the European Union would be handled at \u201cthe European level\u201d.\n\nThe United States is the European Union second largest trading partner, according to US trade data. On Sunday President Trump called the European Union an \u201catrocity\u201d that would also be facing tariffs, saying the bloc was \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the United States.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Candidate for German Chancellor on how he would deal with President Trump 00:47 - Source: CNN Candidate for German Chancellor on how he would deal with President Trump 00:47\n\nAnecdotally, Merz told CNN that during Trump\u2019s first term in the White House the EU brokered a deal that led to tariffs ending six weeks later.\n\nThe likely future chancellor has also been a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has vowed his continued support. \u201cWe are on the Ukrainian side because the attack is against all of us,\u201d he told CNN, while also urging that Germany keep meeting its NATO pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defense, another Trump bugbear.\n\nOn the issue of ending the war, something which President Trump vowed to do within 24 hours after he assumed office, Merz said it would be best to cooperate with the US.\n\nHe was eager however, to hear the plans from the horse\u2019s mouth: \u201cwe do not yet know what they are really planning to do. I would like to see what they are planning to do\u201d.\n\nCrucially for Merz, he may not have to wait much longer.",

The Russian Investigative Committee later confirmed Sarkisyan\u2019s death, stating that \u201cdespite the assistance provided, one of the victims died in a medical facility.\u201d\n\nSarkisyan, also known by nickname \u201cArmen Gorlovsky\u201d after Horlivka (Gorlovka in Russian) the eastern Ukrainian town he is from, founded the separatist Arbat Battalion fighting in the region. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence described him as a \u201cwell-known criminal mastermind\u201d who became the \u201csupervisor\u201d of prisons across Russia and occupied territories of Ukraine in November 2022.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Intelligence said the founding of Arbat in 2022 was an attempt to counterbalance the influence of Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in the Russian private military company sector. Prigozhin was killed the following year when his plane crashed two months after his attempted mutiny against Russia\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe battalion fought in several key battles of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) previously said. Arbat was composed \u201calmost entirely\u201d of former Wagner personnel, the US-based conflict monitor said in October 2023.\n\nSarkisyan was an ally of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-leaning leader who was ousted following deadly protests in Ukraine in 2014 and fled to Russia, according to Ukrainian authorities. Sarkisyan was wanted in Ukraine for his alleged role in the violent response to those demonstrations against Yanukovych.\n\nSarkisyan was leaving the exclusive Aliye Parusa residential complex in northwest Moscow on Monday morning when the explosion happened, a local resident said in a video published by the independent Russian media outlet SOTA.\n\nAsked about the incident during a press briefing on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cThe special services are doing their job. It is difficult work. The information is being clarified, and work is ongoing, so it is impossible for us to comment on anything at this time.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA Palestinian toddler forced to wait weeks for permission to leave Gaza for life saving medical treatment has finally arrived in Jordan. The girl is now in hospital receiving critical medical treatment.\n\nTwo-year-old Habiba al-Askari left the besieged Palestinian enclave after a mammoth effort at the \u201chighest level\u201d in Amman, a Jordanian official familiar with the negotiations told CNN. Jordan decided to evacuate her following a CNN report on her story.\n\nIsrael initially approved Habiba\u2019s treatment abroad last month, before it denied authorization for medical evacuations for more than two weeks, according to international aid groups.\n\nDoctors believe Habiba has protein C deficiency \u2013 a rare but highly treatable genetic condition, which causes excessive blood clotting \u2013 and warned that the child will likely lose her right leg and possibly arms.\n\nBut thousands of children like Habiba cannot access life-saving care in Gaza, where more than 15 months of Israel\u2019s siege and bombardment has paralyzed the medical system.\n\nFollowing a CNN report on Habiba last month, Jordan decided to evacuate her to Amman for urgent medical treatment. Israel then delayed the mission, Jordanian officials told CNN last week. Israeli authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s repeated requests for comment at the time.\n\nOn Thursday, Habiba was admitted into intensive care in Gaza\u2019s Nasser Hospital with a lung infection. Her heart stopped twice, according to her mother and health workers who resuscitated her. On Sunday, Israel further delayed clearing the evacuation \u2013 postponing the urgent mission and refusing to allow her mother Rana to accompany her daughter.\n\nIn CNN video from the hospital over the weekend, Rana, 37, sobbed and embraced her daughter at her bedside. In one scene, Habiba, who is too young to understand her mother\u2019s pain, leaned over and kissed her mother on the cheeks.\n\n\u201cOh Lord I pray to you for a miracle, but if this is your will, I will accept it,\u201d Rana cried before collapsing to the floor. Habiba, sitting up in her bed, stared quietly at the nurses who rushed to pick up her mother.\n\nJordanian officials worked behind the scenes to obtain Israeli approval for Rana to escort Habiba and the girl\u2019s brother Soheib.\n\nTo spare Habiba a long and perilous journey, Jordan had requested an airlift by its military from the Israel-Gaza border, but Israel denied that request, according to a senior Jordanian official, who told CNN Israeli authorities would only approve a land movement.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel then authorized Soheib\u2019s journey \u2013 before revoking its permission at the last minute, according to Jordanian officials. The official told CNN that they finally obtained approval for the whole family to leave Gaza early Monday.\n\nThe senior official described the mission to evacuate Habiba as unnecessarily difficult. \u201cWe worked relentlessly, daily, to get Habiba out. It was followed at the highest levels in Jordan,\u201d the official said.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli aid agency, told CNN on Monday: \u201cIsrael has approved Habiba Mahmoud Abd al-Nasser Askari\u2019s departure to Jordan for medical treatment, accompanied by her mother and her 10-year-old brother.\u201d\n\nApprovals for the departure of children and their family members for medical treatment were \u201csubject to a security review by relevant authorities before their entry into Israel\u2019s sovereign territory,\u201d COGAT said on January 14.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military campaign since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks has erased entire families, spawned starvation and disease, and decimated medical infrastructure in Gaza. After a fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas materialized on January 19, Palestinians say they are struggling to reconcile the psychological trauma and physical destruction wrought by more than a year of war.\n\n\u2018The stakes are a child\u2019s life\u2019\n\nOn Monday, the toddler and her family were first transferred in an ambulance by Gaza\u2019s health ministry to the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel and handed over to a Jordanian medical team.\n\nHabiba was then taken through Israel and into Jordan via the King Hussein Bridge, also known as the Allenby Bridge crossing, where a medical team dispatched at the order of King Abdullah II was waiting in a helicopter to take her to a hospital in Amman.\n\nA CNN team on the ground at the Jordanian side of the border heard sirens and saw blue and red ambulance lights illuminating a path leading to the helicopter. Three military medics met Rana and her two children inside the emergency vehicle Monday evening before the family were transferred into the chopper. The toddler lay swaddled in a blanket with a red fluffy toy as Rana gazed out the window, her eyes weary with exhaustion after her first time leaving Gaza.\n\n\ufeffMilitary medics monitored Habiba\u2019s oxygen levels throughout the ten-minute flight to Amman before they arrived at the Queen Rania Al Abdullah Hospital for Children. Habiba was then seen to by medical workers at the facility. Habiba lay in bed and beamed up at her older brother.\n\nHabiba (center) was medically evacuated from Gaza by the Jordanian military on Monday, in a special mission after Israel had repeatedly delayed her evacuation. Jomana Karadsheh/CNN\n\nCOGAT previously told CNN that it has enabled 24 medical evacuations from Gaza through Israel to other countries \u201cin recent months,\u201d for 1,075 Gaza residents seeking medical care. Between 12,000 to 14,000 people still require medical evacuation from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAt least 37 patients and 39 companions left Gaza from Rafah, WHO said on Saturday, after the crossing re-opened.\n\nLike Habiba, 2,500 other children in Gaza require urgent medical evacuation, according to the UN. But for those waiting for a lifeline, there is no such promise, according to a humanitarian worker in the region.\n\nArwa Damon, the founder of the relief organization INARA, told CNN that Israel\u2019s process for facilitating children\u2019s medical evacuations from Gaza is \u201cnever clear.\u201d INARA was not involved in Habiba\u2019s evacuation mission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to navigate a twisted reality TV show\u2026 where the rules for survival are\u2026 constantly shifting and the stakes are a child\u2019s life,\u201d Damon said Monday. \u201cWhat we have faced trying to get Habiba out is not unique to her, it\u2019s the status quo.\u201d",

She finally moved back home last year, two years after relocating.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t adapt to their way of living,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from the American way of living\u2026 I had very high expectations, and they were totally crumbled.\u201d\n\nCristina\u2019s ill-fated love affair with Spain began back in 1995, when she visited the country for the first time and instantly fell for its charm.\n\nAfter visiting a few more times, Cristina returned with her husband and felt certain that \u201cit would be a lovely place to live.\u201d\n\nShe began looking into the prospect of moving there soon after, making sure to do as much research as she could before making a final decision.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have good information,\u201d she reflects today.\n\nOnce Cristina and her husband had sold their Florida home and gone through the process of applying for a non-lucrative visa \u2013 which allows non-EU nationals to live in Spain without working, provided that they can prove that they have enough money to support themselves \u2013 they were ready to begin their new lives in Spain.\n\nThey left the US in May 2022, heading to Santander, capital city of the Cantabria region on Spain\u2019s north coast, where they\u2019d rented a home.\n\nCristina says she was relatively happy in the beginning and went on to buy a chalet on the countryside of the same region after falling \u201cin love with the area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the first year was like a honeymoon stage,\u201d she says. \u201cI was more in that stage of, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re in Europe. This is what we\u2019ve always wanted. This is a dream come true.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, by the following year, Cristina was seeing things very differently, and soon realized that the Spanish way of life wasn\u2019t going to work for her.\n\n\u201cI started to realize\u2026 this is not what we had envisioned,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, we wanted to be here long-term. Forever and ever.\n\n\u201cBut the way the country is going, and the way they do things, is definitely not what I\u2019m used to.\u201d\n\nHigh hopes\n\nMartinez decided to relocate to the Cantabria region of Spain, but things didn't turn out the way she hoped. jon chica parada/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSo where did it all go wrong? Somewhat surprisingly, Cristina says that the weather was one of the main issues for her.\n\nThey were based in northern Spain, which has very cold winters, and Cristina admits that she wasn\u2019t prepared for quite how gloomy it would be for several months of the year.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t take six months or five months of bad weather,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes it just rains five days out of the week. It rains day and night\u2026\n\n\u201cYou also have a lot of humidity and wind. And when all those things add up, it\u2019s a very cold, gloomy and depressing winter. And all these elements make it easier for you to get sick.\u201d\n\nAnd while Cristina struggled with the cold during winter, the lack of air-conditioning in many Spanish homes meant that summertime wasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing for her either.\n\n\u201cBe prepared to not live with air conditioning,\u201d she says. \u201cTo live with the windows open.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she considered moving south, Cristina explains that she was worried about the prospect of squatters taking over if she purchased a second property in Spain and left one empty.\n\n\u201cThe country has a big problem with squatters,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cif you buy a property over there, you run the risk of it being occupied.\u201d\n\nSpanish laws around squatting are complicated, particularly due to a clause in the Spanish constitution stating that all citizens have \u201cthe right to adequate housing.\u201d\n\nSquatters can only be evicted immediately if they\u2019ve moved in within the last 48 hours. If more than two days have passed, homeowners must take the appropriate judicial measures to remove them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we didn\u2019t know about,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo that right there was also a big game changer.\n\n\u201cBecause here in Miami, we don\u2019t have that kind of a problem. And if we do, it\u2019s very minor.\u201d\n\nCristina also found the Spanish schedule, which sees some businesses close for siesta in the afternoons, very difficult to adjust to.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that really bothered me about them over there (was) their way of living and their way of doing things,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAll of their businesses and restaurants, for the most part, close at three or four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Banks close at two, and then you can\u2019t do anything. There\u2019s no services being provided.\u201d\n\nThe differing meal times were another source of frustration for Cristina.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go and eat because they close at four, and then they don\u2019t open again until eight, nine o\u2019clock at night,\u201d she adds.\n\nAs for the cost of living, Cristina concedes that she found groceries to be less expensive, although utilities were \u201cjust about the same as the US.\u201d\n\nWhile she also found housing to be cheaper, Cristina points out that \u201cyou get what you pay for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed that the cheaper homes for rent, you would find them on the outskirts of the big city in remote areas,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOut in the country. Some houses and apartments can be in a town that is not that good. It may not have that many services. So it just depends.\n\n\u201cAs a foreigner, you really have to do your homework if you want to go live over there.\u201d\n\n\u2018Closed culture\u2019\n\nMartinez couldn't adapt to life in Spain, and decided to move back to the US after two years in the European country. Cristina Martinez\n\nCristina points out that sales tax is \u201chigh\u201d in Spain \u2013 the rate averaged 18.76 percent from 2000 until 2024.\n\n\u201cPeople think that it\u2019s cheaper, but you really need to do the math,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are you going to get with the exchange rate?\n\n\u201cHow much money are you really going to have left? Take into consideration the high sales tax\u2026 Because at the end of the day, it may not be that cheap.\u201d\n\nWhile Cristina didn\u2019t necessarily have strong opinions about Spanish food before moving there, she grew to dislike it, finding it to be largely \u201cfried, greasy and unhealthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a while, I got really tired and grossed out with the Spaniard food,\u201d she says, noting that there\u2019s a little \u201cmore variety\u201d in bigger cities such as Madrid and Barcelona.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m done with the French fries\u2026 I\u2019m done with the seafood.\u2019 It\u2019s like seafood for everything.\u201d\n\nAlthough Cristina didn\u2019t have issues making friends in the country, she found Spain to be more of a \u201cclosed culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t open up their house to people very easily,\u201d she says. \u201cThey talk to you, but it\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, come over to my house and have some drinks.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Cristina, many of the locals she encountered seemed surprised that she\u2019d chosen to relocate to Spain.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would be like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re from Miami, but what are you doing here?\u2019\u201d she recounts. And as time went on, Cristina began to ask herself the same question.\n\nShe found herself aching for the convenience she was used to back in Miami, as well as her friends and family.\n\n\u201cThe convenience of everything being open,\u201d she says. \u201cGoing to the supermarket or going to a regular pharmacy and finding everything that you need.\u201d\n\nAs she was weighing up her options, Cristina was offered her former social work job back, and decided to accept the offer.\n\nHome sweet home\n\nMartinez is now back in Miami, Florida, and says she has no plans to return to Spain. Sylvain Sonnet/The Image Bank RF/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOnce my job was guaranteed, and they offered it to me. I got a ticket right away, and I left Spain\u2026\u201d she recounts.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t make sense (to stay). Because I thought staying had nothing to offer me. So it was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nWhile Cristina has little positive to say about her time in Spain, she admits that she was a big fan of the landscape in the northern coast.\n\n\u201cI like the greenery,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pretty area. You have the ocean and the mountains together\u2026 There\u2019s a lot of pretty scenery.\n\n\u201cIt (Cantabria) is a very agricultural part of Spain. So there\u2019s horses, of course, and sheep. It\u2019s peaceful. Living in the north, it\u2019s a peaceful place to live. And not too much crime.\u201d\n\nHowever, the scenery clearly wasn\u2019t enough to convince her to remain there.\n\nNow happily back in the US, Cristina says she feels as though she was misled about Spain, and wished she\u2019d have known more about the way the country operates and its \u201coutdated\u201d procedures.\n\n\u201cIf I would\u2019ve known all these things beforehand, I would have never moved to Spain,\u201d she adds.\n\nCristina admits that she was particularly disappointed by her experiences, as she\u2019d assumed that she\u2019d fit right in due to her background, not to mention the fact that she spoke the language.\n\n\u201cTheir lifestyle, the way they live, is very different from the Hispanic way of living,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cMy culture, we\u2019re more warm. We\u2019re more tropical, very happy-go-lucky for the most part\u2026\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re more cheerful. We\u2019re more optimistic. We\u2019re more like go-getters.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of great opportunities here in the United States, and we\u2019ve known how to take advantage of that, and we\u2019ve moved to bigger and better places.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she plans to return to Spain for a visit, Cristina says she\u2019s in no hurry to go back.\n\n\u201cIt left a really bad taste in my mouth, the whole experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I don\u2019t even want to go back for vacation. I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not only because of my experience. But because of other people that I\u2019ve talked to that live over there too. They\u2019re upset too, about their country.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to tell you that the United States is the perfect country. It\u2019s not. But we have more things going for us here than over there.\n\n\u201cI would have stayed over there if they had a different way of living.\u201d",

                "text": "BALTIMORE -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) unveiled the design for the new Francis Scott Key Bridge almost a year after it was hit by a cargo ship, causing it to collapse.\n\n\"Today, we take an important step toward recovering from the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse that has affected not just Maryland's economy, but the nation's economy,\" said Gov. Moore. \"While we mark the unveiling of the new bridge design, we continue to honor the six Marylanders who lost their lives while serving our state and their families who carry their legacy forward. Together, we will show the world what it means to be Maryland Tough and Baltimore Strong.\"\n\nThe Key Bridge was hit by the Dali on March 26, 2024, after the ship lost power. The collapse sent seven workers into the Patapsco River, killing six of them. Another worker was on a portion of the bridge that did not collapse.\n\nAgencies, leaders and lawmakers from across the state jumped into action, setting four key objectives in response to the tragedy: Locate all the victims, clear the channel and reopen the Port of Baltimore, support everyone impacted by the collapse and rebuild the Key Bridge.\n\n\"We tackled our first three directives faster than anyone anticipated,\" Gov. Moore said.\n\nThe proposed bridge design honors the architectural tradition of the original Key Bridge, according to the governor.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore and the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) unveiled the design for the new Francis Scott Key Bridge almost a year after it was hit by a cargo ship, causing it to collapse. Moore-Miller Administration\n\n\"Our new bridge will also be constructed in accordance with the most advanced industry standards and the very best in infrastructure design,\" Gov. Moore said. \"We are going to use the best materials available and employ many Marylanders to build it.\"\n\nThe cable stay design of the new bridge will allow the federal shipping channel to expand from 700 ft. to 1,000 ft. wide. The base of the bridge will also be raised to 230 ft., which is a 45-foot increase to accommodate ship traffic.\n\nThe roadway will still be two lanes wide going in each direction. Other pier support structures will be implemented to secure the structure.\n\n\"We're basically taking the best of the best that we can find, but we're also very focused on the time to redo this bridge,\" MDOT Sec. Paul Wiedefeld said.\n\nIn the spring, demolition will begin to remove the remaining pillars of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Immediately after that, Gov. Moore says construction will begin.\n\nLt. Gov. Aruna Miller, whose background is in civil and transportation engineering, says a lot of work is already happening on land and on the water before the demo.\n\nAdditional updates on the construction schedule and budget are expected in a few months.\n\nGov. Moore also highlighted the state's proposed investment in Tradepoint Atlantic and its new shipping terminal project.\n\n\"It is going to increase the Port of Baltimore's container capacity by 70%, create more than 8,000 jobs, and generate $1 billion in private investment,\" Gov. Moore said.\n\nGenerating economic growth is a cornerstone of the Moore-Miller agenda this Legislative Session in Annapolis.\n\nImpact of the Key Bridge collapse\n\nThe collapse of the Key Bridge impacted operations at one of the country's largest ports along with local businesses and residents who relied on the bridge for their commute.\n\nThe main channel at the Port of Baltimore was closed after the bridge collapsed, stopping the flow of goods transported by cargo ships and leaving an impact on the supply chain.\n\nA channel reopened for small boats in April, and in June, a channel reopened for cargo.\n\nSome small businesses saw dips in revenue after the collapse. Owner of Anchor Bay Marina and Hard Yacht Cafe, Alex DelSordo said they lost 9% of their revenue and some employees have been forced to quit their jobs because their commute is upwards of 90 minutes per day.\n\n\"That bridge is a connector of commerce for small businesses like in Dundalk, Sparrows Point, the east side of Baltimore,\" DelSordo told WJZ. \"And now that we're 10 months after the fact, we're seeing it every single day, the impact it makes on the employees and also the customer.\"\n\nSome local organizations launched initiatives to support businesses that were impacted by the collapse.\n\nFight for funding\n\nFollowing the collapse of the bridge, former President Joe Biden said the federal government should pay for the cost of reconstruction.\n\nHe later approved Gov. Moore's request for funding, giving the state an initial $60 million in emergency relief to recover debris from the Patapsco River.\n\nIn November 2024, the former president included money for the Key Bridge in a $100 billion disaster fund request sent to Congress.\n\nBy December, Maryland lawmakers announced that federal funding would cover the full cost of rebuilding the bridge.\n\n\"This will allow the bridge to be built as quickly as possible,\" Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin said in a joint statement. \"Our provision also ensures that the federal taxpayers will be reimbursed through proceeds from insurance payments and litigation taken on by the Department of Justice, the Maryland Attorney General and others.\"\n\nRebuilding the Key Bridge\n\nIn August 2024, the MDTA approved a $73 million contract with Kiewit Infrastructure Company for the design and construction of a new bridge.\n\nPre-construction began in January 2025, and the rebuild is expected to be completed by fall 2028. Kiewit Infrastructure estimated that the project will cost about $2 billion.\n\nThe pre-construction activities include inspecting about 1,100 homes and businesses in nearby communities, scanning the riverbed, collecting soil samples and surveying, according to the MDTA.\n\nIn January, the MDTA also approved a $75 million contract with the Bridging Maryland Partnership for General Engineering Consultant services. The partnership will perform planning, engineering, construction, management and program support for the rebuild project.\n\nStakeholders, industry experts and local communities can get updates on the project on the MDTA's Key Bridge Rebuild Facebook page.",

You're not gonna have the culture. You're not going to have the music and the community that we're, perhaps, used to seeing around us.\"Rogers also said the protest is an attempt to make sure all immigrants are not lumped into the same group as criminals the Trump administration is looking to target for deportation.\"Support the idea that we're not all in the same bag and see us as individuals,\" she said.The Hispanic Alliance said they have multiple resources available for immigrants in the Upstate.

Why put her on this earth for 13 years and take her away?'\" The response: \"God put her here just long enough for you to enjoy her, but her mission was to save your life.\"\n\nSymaria, who once dreamed of becoming an entertainer, is now known for something even greater\u2014giving the gift of life.\n\n\"Her work was done, her journey was done, she did well in her life, but she gets to continue on and save others so that they can continue on and be a vessel, be a light in this world,\" Martin said.\n\nFor more information on organ donation, visit Donate Life Florida.",

Share Copy Link Copy\n\nAt the 11th hour Monday evening, it was announced that the tariffs that were set to hit Canadian goods were delayed after Mexico's also were earlier in the day. Still, throughout Monday people across Vermont gave their thoughts on the prospect of the tariffs and expressed concern. Vermont Senator Peter Welch, a heavy critic of the tariffs, said he believes they will ultimately hurt Vermonters. \"They are really bad. It's going to hurt our economy. Estimates are these could cost the average Vermont family about $1,200 a year,\" he said. Peter Matthews, a professor at Middlebury College, said energy costs should be one of the biggest concerns, as the threat of tariffs still looms. \"Green Mountain Power relies on imported energy from the province of Quebec for a substantial part of its portfolio. A 10% tariff even on that means that GMP has to pay 10% more to its imports of energy, and it would be astonishing if not some or all of that was passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices,\" he said. Vermont's farming industry said they rely on Canada for grain, seed and other items and were concerned at the prospects of tariffs. \"My immediate concern was grain prices, a lot of the grain comes out of Canada. Fortunately, we've locked our prices in for the next year, but our carton and paper products will be increased,\" said Jackie Devoid of Maple Meadow Farm. Maple product distributors were also worried because it would be more expensive to get their equipment. \"The vast majority of large maple equipment, evaporators and similar, come out of four large equipment manufacturers who all have their home basis in... you guessed it, Canada,\" said Allison Hope, the Executive Director of the Vermont Maple Sugars Association.",

Although these quakes are considered minor or light, authorities have closed schools on Santorini, as well as on Amorgos, Ios and Anafi, and advised residents to avoid large indoor gatherings.\n\nAfter an emergency meeting Monday, Greek authorities announced that schools on the four islands will remain closed until Friday.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a very intense geological phenomenon. I want to ask the islanders to remain calm,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told reporters in Brussels on Monday, on the sidelines of a meeting of European Union leaders.\n\nIn an update, Vassilis Karastathis, director at the Institute of Geodynamics at the National Observatory of Athens, told Greek media on Monday that \u201cthe seismic activity continues regularly with the same intensity.\u201d\n\nAegean Airlines, Greece\u2019s largest airline, announced two additional flights on Monday and one on Tuesday, traveling to and from Santorini, to help residents and visitors leave the island.\n\nNikos Zorzos, the mayor of the island, denied that there was a \u201cmass exodus\u201d from the island, and told Greek media that the majority of those leaving were seasonal workers, not permanent residents.\n\nSitting on several fault lines \u2013 known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc \u2013 Santorini is no stranger to earthquakes. But the risk of tremors does not deter as many as 3.4 million people from visiting Santorini each year, dwarfing the 20,000 or so permanent residents of the island.\n\nTents have been set up at a basketball court to accommodate emergency services in Santorini on Monday. Petros Giannakouris/AP\n\nA firefighter controls a drone as authorities take emergency measures in Santorini on Monday. Petros Giannakouris/AP\n\nSantorini is famed for its crescent-shaped caldera, which was created by one of the largest known volcanic eruptions around 3,600 years ago. The tourist destination has been dubbed Greece\u2019s \u201cInstagram island\u201d because of its photogenic golden light and sweeping scenery.\n\nThe Hellenic Volcanic Arc, one of the most active volcanic fields in Europe, has seen more than 100 eruptions over the past 400,000 years.\n\nThe most recent large quake in Santorini struck in 1956. The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was followed by a 25-meter-high (around 80 feet) tsunami. At least 53 people were killed and more than 100 injured, while at least one-third of the houses on the island collapsed.\n\nAuthorities said current seismic activity is due to tectonic movements that do not appear related to volcanic activity. Similarly, increased seismic activity in 2011 and 2012 did not result in any eruptions, they added.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

                "text": "On a clear spring evening in Michigan, the stars aligned \u2014 just not in the way Upfront Ventures partner Nick Kim expected.\n\nHe\u2019d just led a $9.5 million seed round for OurSky, a software platform for space observational data, and was eager to see what its telescope partner PlaneWave Instruments could do.\n\nBut when they rolled out the telescopes that night at PlaneWave\u2019s manufacturing facility, he was stuck waiting.\n\n\u201cIt took them quite a long time to get the first image. I\u2019m talking like, multiple hours. And these are the people who make the telescopes! They were using all this, like, off-the-shelf, open source software that they kind of cobbled together,\u201d Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nKim wasn\u2019t upset, though. He was excited. \u201cThis is why OurSky needed to exist, right? This is the problem,\u201d he remembered thinking. \u201cWhat a perfect match.\u201d\n\nIt was such a good match that, now, OurSky and PlaneWave are merging to create a new company called Observable Space.\n\nOurSky founder Dan Roelker and PlaneWave founder Richard Hedrick say this will make the telescopes easier to use. And they also believe the tighter integration will open up new markets \u2014 especially as they leverage their position as the only U.S.-based telescope manufacturer. They already count NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and Georgia State University\u2019s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy as customers.\n\n\u201cMy dream was to integrate all the components on the telescope, even the parts we don\u2019t sell, and then integrate the control of the telescope,\u201d Hedrick said in an interview. \u201cIt was very obvious for us to be working together.\u201d\n\nRoelker, who was SpaceX\u2019s VP of software engineering from 2015 to 2019, said telescope users have to deal with what he called a \u201cmash of integration bullsh\u2013.\u201d PlaneWave\u2019s vertical strategy combined with OurSky\u2019s software will eliminate those headaches, he said.\n\nSolving that integration problem is an opportunity for Observable Space to grow the market, Roelker said. (The platform OurSky has built will continue on in that name, and the telescopes will continue to be sold under the PlaneWave brand.)\n\nThat can involve a number of things, like letting users tap multiple telescopes at a single site \u2014 or even around the world \u2014 to mimic the capabilities of a much larger telescope, or sending communications to and from space via laser, all while lowering cost.\n\nSqueezing more out of his high-quality telescopes sold Hedrick on the merger. It will make the tech more approachable and affordable for enthusiasts and institutions alike.\n\nHedrick said one of those institutions recently designed some one-meter telescopes and had them custom-built by someone else. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018God, if you had existed, we never would have done that,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nNew business\n\nAs the cost to get to orbit shrinks, more companies are sending things to space, Roelker said. That means there is increased demand for the ability to locate and track objects orbiting the Earth, communicate with spacecraft, and enable defense and intelligence applications.\n\nObservable Space can be a key player in that new economy, according to Mislav Tolusic, managing partner at dual-use venture fund Marlinspike, which has invested in Observable Space.\n\n\u201cEvery day you\u2019re relying on space,\u201d Tolusic said in an interview. \u201cIf you take out GPS constellations, we\u2019re in trouble economically. It\u2019s a big, big, big deal. A lot of systems stop functioning. And guess what? The future is going to be even more dependent on that infrastructure.\u201d\n\nTolusic praised PlaneWave\u2019s quality, and noted Hedrick built up the company at a time when basically all telescope manufacturing is overseas \u2014 which he believes is an advantage.\n\n\u201cIf you want to replicate that [in the U.S.], you have to go figure out how to make those fine lenses, how to make gimbals \u2014 and not just how to design them but how to spit them out by the thousands,\u201d he said.\n\nJordan Noone, general partner at Embedded Ventures, explained his fund\u2019s investment with a specific example of what OurSky and PlaneWave can do as a combined company.\n\nShortly before the merger, Noone was at Mount Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles for a demo of the companies\u2019 products working together.\n\nHe told TechCrunch that the teams pulled an observation request from the queue on OurSky\u2019s platform: a satellite operator had lost radio contact with its spacecraft. The OurSky and PlaneWave teams located it quickly.\n\nWhat he described was a much smoother experience than Kim\u2019s demo in Michigan, and served as proof in his mind that Observable Space was a good bet to make.\n\n\u201cMany of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, like Apple, Nvidia \u2014 they\u2019re hardware/software platform combos,\u201d Noone said. \u201cCompanies that approach just one of those two can have a lot of inherent value, but the combination of both in today\u2019s world is extremely powerful.\u201d\n\nStar Wars or Star Trek?\n\nObservable Space has about 100 employees, with the manufacturing operations remaining in Michigan, some engineering happening in Los Angeles, California, and an observatory outside Washington, D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s already revenue-generating, and the combined company has raised $11 million to date, including funding from In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s nonprofit strategic investment arm.\n\nHedrick and Roelker said the two companies have fit together easily, since they were both focused on such different businesses and didn\u2019t have massive back-office operations.\n\n\u201cGoing through the merger process itself was actually really valuable, because when you\u2019re going through it, a lot of issues pop up,\u201d Roelker said. \u201cYou actually get a really good sense of how you\u2019re going to work together. And I think both Rick and I felt really good about that, because we actually went through some really hard things during the merger.\u201d\n\nWhen asked, the pair did not describe those \u201chard things,\u201d and Hedrick instead quipped: \u201cWe had to decide on whether [the company] was going to be Star Wars or Star Trek.\u201d\n\nThe answer?\n\n\u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d Roelker said.",

                "text": "Swiss startup LogicStar is bent on joining the AI agent game. The summer 2024-founded startup has bagged $3 million in pre-seed funding to bring tools to the developer market that can do autonomous maintenance of software applications, rather than the more typical AI agent use case of code co-development.\n\nLogicStar CEO and co-founder Boris Paskalev (pictured top right, in the feature image, with his fellow co-founders) suggests the startup\u2019s AI agents could end up partnering with code development agents \u2014 such as, say, the likes of Cognition AI\u2019s Devin \u2014 in a business win-win.\n\nCode fidelity is an issue for AI agents building and deploying software, just as it is for human developers, and LogicStar wants to do its bit to grease the development wheel by automatically picking up and fixing bugs wherever they may crop up in deployed code.\n\nAs it stands, Paskalev suggests that \u201ceven the best models and agents\u201d out there are unable to resolve the majority of bugs they\u2019re presented with \u2014 hence the team spying an opportunity for an AI startup that\u2019s dedicated to improving these odds and delivering on the dream of less tedious app maintenance.\n\nTo this end, they are building atop large language models (LLMs) \u2014 such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT or even China\u2019s DeepSeek \u2014 taking a model-agnostic approach for their platform. This allows LogicStar to dip into different LLMs and maximize its AI agents\u2019 utility, based on which foundational model works best for resolving a particular code issue.\n\nPaskalev contends that the founding team has the technical and domain-specific knowledge to build a platform that can resolve programming problems which can challenge or outfox LLMs working alone. They also have past entrepreneurial success to point to: He sold his prior code review startup, DeepCode, to cybersecurity giant Snyk back in September 2020.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning we were thinking about actually building a large language model for code,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThen we realized that that will quickly become a commodity\u2026 Now we\u2019re building assuming all those large language models are there. Assuming there\u2019s some actually decent [AI] agents for code, how do we extract the maximum business value from them?\u201d\n\nHe said that the idea built on the team\u2019s understanding of how to analyze software applications. \u201cCombine that with large language models \u2014 then focus into grounding and verifying what those large language models and the AI agent actually suggest.\u201d\n\nTest-driven development\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? Paskalev says LogicStar performs an analysis of each application that its tech is deployed on \u2014 using \u201cclassical computer science methods\u201d \u2014 in order to build a \u201cknowledge base.\u201d This gives its AI agent a comprehensive map of the software\u2019s inputs and outputs; how variables link to functions; and any other linkages and dependencies, etc.\n\nThen, for every bug it\u2019s presented with, the AI agent is able to determine which parts of the application are impacted \u2014 allowing LogicStar to narrow down the functions needing to be simulated in order to test scores of potential fixes.\n\nPer Paskalev, this \u201cminimized execution environment\u201d allows the AI agent to run \u201cthousands\u201d of tests aimed at reproducing bugs to identify a \u201cfailing test,\u201d and \u2014 through this \u201ctest-driven development\u201d approach \u2014 ultimately land on a fix that sticks.\n\nHe confirms that the actual bug fixes are sourced from the LLMs. But because LogicStar\u2019s platform enables this \u201cvery fast executive environment\u201d its AI agents can work at scale to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, and serve its users with a shortcut to the best that LLMs can offer.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is [LLMs are] great for prototyping, testing things, etc., but it\u2019s absolutely not great for [code] production, commercial applications. I think we\u2019re far from there, and this is what our platform delivers,\u201d he argued. \u201cTo be able to extract those capabilities of the models today, we can actually safely extract commercial value and actually save time for developers to really focus on the important stuff.\u201d\n\nEnterprises are set to be LogicStar\u2019s initial target. Its \u201csilicon agents\u201d are intended to be put to work alongside corporate dev teams, albeit at a fraction of the salary required to hire a human developer, handling a range of app upkeep tasks and freeing up engineering talent for more creative and/or challenging work. (Or, well, at least until LLMs and AI agents get a lot more capable.)\n\nWhile the startup\u2019s pitch touts a \u201cfully autonomous\u201d app maintenance capability, Paskalev confirms that the platform will allow human developers to review (and otherwise oversee) the fixes its AI agents call up. So trust can be \u2014 and must be \u2014 earned first.\n\n\u201cThe accuracy that a human developer delivers ranges between 80 to 90%. Our goal [for our AI agents] is to be exactly there,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for LogicStar: An alpha version of its technology is in testing with a number of undisclosed companies which Paskalev refers to as \u201cdesign partners.\u201d Currently the tech only supports Python \u2014 but expansions to TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java are billed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main goal [with the pre-seed funding] is to actually show the technology works with our design partners \u2014 focusing on Python,\u201d adds Paskalev. \u201cWe already spent a year on it, and we have lots of opportunity to actually expand. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to focus it first, to show the value in one case.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s pre-seed raise was led by European VC firm Northzone, with angel investors from DeepMind, Fleet, Sequoia scouts, Snyk, and Spotify also joining the round.\n\nIn a statement, Michiel Kotting, partner at Northzone, said: \u201cAI-driven code generation is still in its early stages, but the productivity gains we\u2019re already seeing are revolutionary. The potential for this technology to streamline development processes, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation is immense. and the team\u2019s vast technical expertise and proven track record position them to deliver real, impactful results. The future of software development is being reshaped, and LogicStar will play a crucial role in software maintenance.\u201d\n\nLogicStar is operating a waiting list for potential customers wanting to express interest in getting early access. It told us a beta release is planned for later this year.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.",

                "text": "An estimated 20% to 30% of all inventory in the U.S. is surplus, with much of it ending up in landfills. A startup called Sotira wants to help address this problem: It leverages AI to help companies offload and monetize their surplus inventory. Sotira partners with brands to offload millions of pounds of surplus grocery, health and wellness, and cosmetics goods all over the United States.\n\nTo fuel its mission, the company has closed a $2 million pre-seed funding round. Sotira plans to use the new funding to expand its operations nationally, specifically in the Midwest and southeast.\n\nThe startup, which exhibited at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200 2024, was founded by CEO Amrita Bhasin and CTO Gary Kwong. The pair met at UC Berkeley and bonded over their shared interest in the e-commerce and logistics space. Bhasin and Kwong were both running their own companies that were focused on selling previously owned, new, or used products.\n\nThe duo then started running a liquidation business together because they wanted to understand how the space operated before jumping into starting a company. They decided to cast a wide net before zeroing in on their mission with Sotira.\n\n\u201cWe learned that the market opportunity for monetizing overstock is huge,\u201d Bhasin told TechCrunch. \u201cIt is a multibillion-dollar market, and it is a very old-school manual space, like the people we\u2019re talking to are doing things on pen and paper. They\u2019ve never heard of ChatGPT, they don\u2019t know what AI is. And so that pretty much was the catalyst for us starting the company. We were like, there is a market opportunity here.\u201d\n\nSotira helps to offload products that are nearing their expiration date, items that are facing storage capacity issues, and products that have been over-ordered. Vetted suppliers can sign up for Sotira and link their storage capacity or inventory. Sotira then matches the products to a buyer that will then pick up pallets from the supplier\u2019s warehouse.\n\nBuyers are verified, brick-and-mortar stores all over the country. They can share the UPC codes of the kind of inventory they purchase, and Sotira will use AI to match them with inventory. Sotira automates compliance and facilitates transactions and logistics with buyers so suppliers get paid upon pickup. Sotira\u2019s goal is to clear surplus within a few days of receiving inventory data.\n\nIn the past, brands would have had to identify the stock they would not be able to sell to their primary purchasers, and then call up different liquidators to compare offers and manually negotiate prices. Sotira has brought this process online and allows suppliers to clear up inventory much faster.\n\nSotira charges a monthly fee for access; it also takes a percentage of revenue from each transaction on its platform.\n\nWhile Sotira is beneficial for suppliers and buyers, Bhasin says Sotira is also proud of its ability to open up affordable access to premium products that people may otherwise be unable to access. For instance, Sotira works with a lot of CPG beverage brands that end up offloading their excess inventory to discount grocery stores.\n\n\u201cIn the economy right now, where you currently look at how rapidly grocery prices are increasing, these are the categories consumers purchase the most,\u201d Bhasin said. \u201cThere is so much value in opening affordable access to these items. A lot of the buyers we work with are in rural areas. They\u2019re in areas that they may be more impoverished, where consumers actually rely on purchasing from over-stock stores, like they won\u2019t purchase from a Whole Foods, they\u2019re purchasing from a discount grocery store.\u201d\n\nBhasin also noted that since California has passed legislation to stop grocery stores from dumping food and beverages, Sotira can now approach these companies and inform them that there\u2019s a market for their surplus inventory.\n\nSotira plans to expand beyond food, beverage, health, and cosmetics in the future and move into the apparel space. The company is getting interest from brands that want help moving their excess clothing and shoes, Bhasin said.\n\nSotira\u2019s pre-seed funding included participation from Unusual Ventures, Night Capital, K5 Global, Ritual Capital, and others.",

                "text": "The fashion industry has concerned Emily Gittins since adolescence.\n\nThe sector is, after all, one of the most polluting in the world. According to some sources, it is responsible for nearly 10% of the earth\u2019s CO 2 emissions and more than 20% of all water waste.\n\nYet people still want more, fast.\n\n\u201cThe way we consume today is hugely problematic,\u201d Gittins told TechCrunch.\n\nIn 2021, Gittins teamed up with Ryan Rowe to launch Archive, a company that provides software to fashion brands and merchants so they can create resale platforms tailored to each business\u2019 wants and needs, including a spot where people can sell used clothes to each other.\n\nCompetitors include Trove and Treet, which also creates online resale software for brands to sell used items. Archive says its product is different because it can support global brands across various continents.\n\nArchive\u2019s features include smart pricing and product feeds, as well as warehouse management to handle intake, processing, repair, and fulfillment; it also provides tools to analyze profits and costs, and allows brands to connect it to their own tools and share data. Archive already works with more than 50 brands, including New Balance, The North Face, and Oscar de la Renta, Gittins says.\n\nThere is a massive opportunity in the general secondhand market, which is expected to hit $73 billion by 2028 in the U.S. alone, according to a resale report by retailer ThreadUp. That share of the fashion industry is only expected to increase, as the Guardian reported, especially among young people and anyone else looking for more eco- and budget-friendly options.\n\nThat\u2019s what convinced VCs to invest a $30 million Series B, led by Energize Capital. Other investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, G9 Ventures, and Bain Capital Ventures. Archive has raised $54 million in total funding to date. Archive will use the new funding to further develop its resale software and more product innovation.\n\nAnother good sign for the clothing resale industry is growing legislation in a number of states that encourages it, like California\u2019s new Responsible Textile Recovery Act, and well as similar legislation in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve debunked the concern that resale cannibalizes full-price sales,\u201d Gittins added. \u201cWe\u2019re in scaling mode with many of our brands and are excited to be launching resale businesses for so many new brands in 2025.\u201d\n\nThis piece was updated to clarify Bain Capital Ventures invested in Archive.",

                "text": "A large portion of Egypt\u2019s population lacks access to traditional banking, forcing many to rely on cash transactions and informal lending. Khazna, a fintech startup founded in 2019, is tackling this issue by offering financial services tailored toward low- and middle-income workers. The company provides solutions like salary advances, digital payments, and microloans to help employees and contractors access much-needed financial services.\n\nKhazna recently secured $16 million in pre-Series B funding, bringing its total funding to over $63 million. The investment will support its expansion plans as it prepares to apply for a digital banking license in Egypt and expand into Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhen we covered the fintech in 2022, it had just raised a $38 million Series A with more than 150,000 customers across its products. Today, Khazna has grown its user base to over 500,000 people; that number is half what it was targeting by the end of 2022, according to what co-founder and CEO Omar Saleh shared at the time.\n\nThe company focuses on workers earning three times less than Egypt\u2019s minimum wage, providing them with affordable financial tools. About 100,000 users receive their payroll through Khazna, allowing the company to integrate financial services such as loans and insurance directly into their payroll accounts.\n\nFor the remaining 400,000 users, Khazna offers lending services, helping gig workers and pensioners access credit. Saleh explained that this product made the fintech break-even last month.\n\n\u201cWhat we did over the last two and half years was to focus on our core product, which is credit offering to payroll and pension recipients and also unsecured loans to gig workers,\u201d Saleh told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is the most profitable and core product in our journey, and getting it right was very important because it has helped us to hit profitability.\u201d\n\nOn the path to becoming a digital bank\n\nKhazna provides other services, like bill payments, buy now, pay later, medical insurance, and a rent-to-own product. But by embedding itself into both payroll and lending, it is strategically moving toward becoming a full-fledged digital bank for Egypt\u2019s underserved communities.\n\nBut one thing is missing: Unlike traditional banks, Khazna doesn\u2019t have access to customer deposits, making it expensive to fund loans. So far, Khazna has relied on wholesale debt financing in dollars (USD) and Egyptian pound (EGP) to fund its lending operations.\n\nTo reduce borrowing costs and offer more affordable loans, Khazna is now working to obtain a deposit-taking license in Egypt. This license would allow the startup to accept customer deposits, allowing it to lower its cost of funds.\n\n\u201cThe biggest game changer here is for us to get access to user deposits. There\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to capture part of that market as well in a way that will make our cost of funding much more attractive than it is today, and ultimately, that would put us in a very differentiated position,\u201d Saleh remarked.\n\nKhazna is targeting mid-2026 to secure the banking license from Egypt\u2019s Central Bank, which laid out its regulatory framework for digital banks in July 2024.\n\nAs the six-year-old fintech gets started with that process, it\u2019s simultaneously setting sights on Saudi Arabia, where there is a growing demand for consumer finance solutions. Unlike BNPL players like Tabby and Tamara, which focus on short-term BNPL credit, Khazna hopes to differentiate itself with medium-term credit products like earned wage access (EWA), payroll-backed lending, and pension-based credit.\n\nExpansion plans, including a not-so-imminent IPO\n\nAnother reason Khazna is prioritizing Saudi is its strong connection with Egypt, Saleh notes. With nearly three million Egyptians living in Saudi, the Egypt-Saudi remittance corridor is one of the world\u2019s largest, presenting an opportunity to offer cross-border financial services, combining credit-led offerings with foreign exchange (FX) solutions.\n\nBeyond market size and product fit, Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital markets are also a driver in Khazna\u2019s decision, according to Saleh. Tadawul, the stock exchange in Saudi Arabia, is one of the region\u2019s most liquid and retail-investor-driven stock exchanges, launching several IPOs over the past couple of years.\n\nFor that reason, Khazna plans to have 40-50% of its business coming from Saudi in the next four years, making it eligible for a public listing on Tadawul. For early-stage investors who have backed the company for four to five years, Saleh says this provides a clear path to a high-value exit.\n\nSure, Khazna will fund this expansion with the recently raised growth capital. However, the macroeconomic challenges in Egypt over the past two years had a hand in structuring this pre-Series B round.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, Egypt faced currency devaluations and economic instability, making fundraising more difficult for startups and ventures. The overall slowdown in deal flow reflected this, as investors took a cautious approach to Egyptian startups. But 2024 brought a major shift, with over $50 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into Egypt following economic reforms and a more flexible exchange rate. As a result, investor confidence returned, bringing renewed interest from global and regional investors.\n\nAs such, Khazna welcomed participation from new and existing investors, including global investors like Quona and Speedinvest, as well as regional investment firms like Aljazira Capital (the investment arm of Bank Aljazira of Saudi Arabia), anb Seed Fund (managed by anb Capital), DisrupTECH, ICU Ventures, Khwarizmi Ventures, and SANAD Fund for MSME.",

                "text": "Self-driving truck startup Waabi is partnering with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to jointly develop and deploy autonomous trucks, an important milestone as it gets closer to a commercial launch.\n\nThe tie-up also marks Volvo\u2019s second partnership to co-develop self-driving big rigs with a startup partner. In May 2024, Volvo teamed up with Aurora Innovation to reveal the Volvo VNL Autonomous truck.\n\nWaabi will be using the same truck, but it will have Waabi\u2019s tech on it, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software.\n\n\u201cWe now have everything we need to scale our product,\u201d Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have the next-generation AV 2.0 technology, we have an approach that is much more capital efficient, and a much faster path to market.\u201d\n\nWaabi plans to launch commercial pilots with the Volvo-built trucks in Texas over the next couple of months, with a product-ready driverless demonstration on public roads planned for the end of 2025.\n\nA fully driverless commercial launch \u2014 directly between customer depots from day one, rather than via terminals \u2014 will follow soon afterward, according to Urtasun.\n\nUrtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021, claims to have built AI models that can reason as a human would, which in turn speeds up commercial deployment and makes for a more efficient system overall. She has reasoned that a better-quality AI will require much less data and compute to understand and react to the world around it.\n\nWaabi has relied on its simulation technology to not just test and train its self-driving technology, but also to help design trucks for OEM integration. The startup unveiled its first purpose-built truck \u2014 with sensors, compute, and software built in at the assembly line \u2014 in 2022.\n\nBy contrast, competitor Kodiak Robotics has developed a self-driving system that includes all of the redundant hardware and software system, but is not tied to one manufacturer. Urtasun is more interested in integrating the Waabi Driver into autonomous trucks at the factory level with no interruption to an OEM\u2019s assembly line.\n\nUrtasun believes this is the best approach to building a safe, reliable product.\n\nWaabi\u2019s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker\u2019s strategic investment into the startup two years ago via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital. Volvo later participated in Waabi\u2019s $200 million Series B.\n\nVolvo will build trucks for Waabi at its production-ready facility in Virginia. Urtasun said the first \u201chandful\u201d would come off the assembly line in 2025, and that she expects a timeline of around two to three years to reach volume scale.\n\nOver that time, Urtasun also noted that capital efficiency will be \u201can absolute must\u201d to be successful in this industry. She says Waabi\u2019s \u201cAI-first approach\u201d means the startup\u2019s capital needs to get to a driverless launch will be \u201ca tiny fraction of what you see in the industry today.\u201d\n\nTo date, Waabi has raised $282 million, per PitchBook data, and Urtasun says the startup has enough to launch a driverless operation on public roads and beyond. Its main competitors, Aurora and Kodiak, have raised $3.46 billion and $243 million, respectively.\n\nAurora plans to launch a driverless commercial trucking operation by April, and Kodiak last month delivered its first autonomous trucks to a commercial partner that will use them for off-road operations.\n\n\u201c2025 is the year of trucking; it\u2019s a make it or break it situation,\u201d Urtasun said. \u201cI think there will be potentially more consolidation.\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t many players left in the game since Embark and TuSimple shut down and Waymo paused its autonomous truck ambitions.\n\nWhen asked if Waabi was considering a merger or acquisition, Urtasun replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. Trucking is only the beginning. We\u2019re going to do so much more than trucking \u2014 robotaxis, warehouse robotics. I have tremendously big plans for the company, and we are going to remain a fully independent company.\u201d",

                "text": "\u201cTabular data\u201d is a broad term that encompasses structured data that generally fits into a specific row and column. It can be an SQL database, a spreadsheet, a .CSV file, etc.\n\nWhile there has been tremendous progress on artificial intelligence applied to unstructured and sequential data, these large language models (LLMs) are fuzzy by design. They are built to manipulate input tokens to generate a coherent output without necessarily following a fixed structure. The best LLMs are also either expensive to access via an API or expensive to run on your own cloud infrastructure.\n\nAnd yet, many companies already have a data strategy with a data warehouse or data lake to centralize all important data and some data scientists that can leverage this data to improve the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nFrench startup Neuralk-AI is an artificial intelligence company that has been working on AI models focused on tabular data. The company this week announced $4 million in funding.\n\n\u201cData with real value for companies is data that was identified a long time ago, structured in the form of a table, and used by the data scientists of these companies to create all their machine learning algorithms,\u201d Neuralk-AI co-founder and chief scientific officer Alexandre Pasquiou told TechCrunch.\n\nNeuralk-AI thinks there\u2019s an opportunity in revisiting AI model development, but with a specific focus on structured data. At first, it plans to offer its model as an API to data scientists working for commerce companies because these companies love data \u2014 think product catalogs, customer databases, shopping cart trends, etc.\n\n\u201cToday, LLMs are great for search, natural user interaction, and answering questions based on unstructured documents. But it has some limitations the moment we go back to classic machine learning, which is really based on classic tabular data,\u201d Pasquiou said.\n\nWith Neuralk-AI, retailers can automate complex data workflows with smart deduplication and enrichment. But they could also use the company\u2019s models to detect fraud, optimize the product recommendations, and generate sales forecasts that could be used for inventory management and product pricing.\n\nFly Ventures led the company\u2019s $4 million round with Steam AI also participating. Several business angels also invested in the startup, such as Thomas Wolf from Hugging Face, Charles Gorintin from Alan, and Philippe Corrot and Nagi Letaifa from Mirakl.\n\nThe team is still actively working on its models. It plans to test with a group of leading French retailers and commerce startups, such as E.Leclerc, Auchan, Mirakl, and Lucky Cart.\n\n\u201cWithin three or four months, we\u2019ll release the first version of our model and the public benchmark on which we\u2019ll be able to rank our model compared to the state-of-the-art in this space,\u201d Pasquiou said. \u201cAnd in September, the idea is to be the best tabular foundation model in everything related to representation learning.\u201d",

                "text": "French startup Riot has raised a $30 million Series B round after reaching $10 million in annual revenue in 2024. Originally focused on educating employees about cybersecurity risks, the company now wants to go one step further and nudge employees so that they minimize their attack surface.\n\nLeft Lane Capital is leading Monday\u2019s round with existing investors Y Combinator, Base10, and FundersClub participating once again. From what TechCrunch has learned, Riot has reached a post-money valuation north of $170 million following the Series B round.\n\nRiot originally started with fake phishing campaigns. Employees regularly receive emails that look like real emails, but they\u2019re designed to trick people into clicking on the links and entering personal information.\n\nThis way, employees learn that they should be more suspicious about incoming emails. Over time, the company added other educational content with a friendly security chatbot called Albert. It can be accessed on Slack and Microsoft Teams.\n\nThat strategy has been working well so far, as Riot currently interacts with 1 million employees across 1,500 companies. Clients include L\u2019Occitane, Deel, Intercom, and Le Monde. (A couple of years ago, Riot only worked with 100,000 employees.)\n\nAnd yet, cyber incidents are still on the rise with widespread consequences. A recent example is the Change Healthcare data breach that is affecting 190 million Americans and started with compromised credentials on a consumer service. An employee reused the same password for their personal account and Change Healthcare\u2019s Citrix portal \u2014 there was no multifactor authentication on Citrix, either.\n\nThat\u2019s why Riot wants to grow beyond educating employees. \u201cOur job is to look at employees\u2019 posture. Do they activate multifactor authentication? Do they have a secure code on their smartphone? Are their privacy settings on LinkedIn not too permissive? There are plenty of things that employees can put in place that will generally make life more difficult for hackers,\u201d Riot founder and CEO Benjamin Netter told TechCrunch.\n\nRiot calls its next product an Employee Security Posture Management platform. It\u2019s going to become a central cockpit to manage security at the employee\u2019s level. While there are many Posture Management solutions, Riot believes employees have been neglected for too long.\n\nHere\u2019s where it would fit in the cybersecurity landscape based on the company\u2019s pitch deck:\n\nImage Credits:Riot\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re creating with the platform is that we\u2019re going to automatically analyze the employees\u2019 security \u2026 and we\u2019re going to give a score, which we\u2019ve called a karma score, which will be an indicator of the employee\u2019s posture,\u201d Netter said.\n\nAfter that, Riot will nudge the employee to change a setting here, activate multifactor authentication there. \u201cIt\u2019s the little things you can do that will take you a minute or two, and that will basically make life difficult for hackers,\u201d Netter added.\n\nThis is going to be an interesting challenge for Riot, as employee security also depends on their cyber hygiene on personal devices and services. Phishing campaigns now also happen on WhatsApp. LinkedIn profiles are widely used for social engineering attacks as well.\n\nThat\u2019s why this new security product will look a bit more like a consumer product, with nice animations and some gamification features to incentivize you to improve your security posture.\n\n\u201cMy long-term vision is to build an employee security company and to provide all the tools in the employee security stack. So it\u2019s possible that one day we will make \u2014 I\u2019ll give you a silly example \u2014 an antivirus or a password manager,\u201d Netter said.\n\nBut first, with today\u2019s funding round, the company also has more cash to grow more rapidly. The team plans to open new offices in other countries and grow its client base to develop those more sophisticated products.",

                "text": "OpenAI is announcing a new AI \u201cagent\u201d designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT, the company\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform.\n\nAppropriately enough, it\u2019s called deep research.\n\nOpenAI said in a blog post published Sunday that this new capability was designed for \u201cpeople who do intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy, and engineering and need thorough, precise, and reliable research.\u201d It could also be useful, the company added, for anyone making \u201cpurchases that typically require careful research, like cars, appliances, and furniture.\u201d\n\nBasically, ChatGPT deep research is intended for instances where you don\u2019t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nOpenAI said it\u2019s making deep research available to ChatGPT Pro users today, limited to 100 queries per month, with support for Plus and Team users coming next, followed by Enterprise. (OpenAI is targeting a Plus rollout in about a month from now, the company said, and the query limits for paid users should be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d soon.) It\u2019s a geo-targeted launch; OpenAI had no release timeline to share for ChatGPT customers in the U.K., Switzerland, and the European Economic Area.\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nTo use ChatGPT deep research, you\u2019ll just select \u201cdeep research\u201d in the composer and then enter a query, with the option to attach files or spreadsheets. (It\u2019s a web-only experience for now, with mobile and desktop app integration to come later this month.) Deep research could then take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to answer the question, and you\u2019ll get a notification when the search completes.\n\nCurrently, ChatGPT deep research\u2019s outputs are text-only. But OpenAI said that it intends to add embedded images, data visualizations, and other \u201canalytic\u201d outputs soon. Also on the roadmap is the ability to connect \u201cmore specialized data sources,\u201d including \u201csubscription-based\u201d and internal resources, OpenAI added.\n\nThe big question is, just how precise is ChatGPT deep research? AI is imperfect, after all. It\u2019s prone to hallucinations and other types of errors that could be particularly harmful in a \u201cdeep research\u201d scenario. That\u2019s perhaps why OpenAI said every ChatGPT deep research output will be \u201cfully documented, with clear citations and a summary of [the] thinking, making it easy to reference and verify the information.\u201d\n\nThe jury\u2019s out on whether those mitigations will be sufficient to combat AI mistakes. OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered web search feature in ChatGPT, ChatGPT Search, not infrequently makes gaffes and gives wrong answers to questions. TechCrunch\u2019s testing found that ChatGPT Search produced less useful results than Google Search for certain queries.\n\nTo beef up deep research\u2019s accuracy, OpenAI is using a special version of its recently announced o3 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model that was trained through reinforcement learning on \u201creal-world tasks requiring browser and Python tool use.\u201d Reinforcement learning essentially \u201cteaches\u201d a model via trial and error to achieve a specific goal. As the model gets closer to the goal, it receives virtual \u201crewards\u201d that, ideally, make it better at the task going forward.\n\nOpenAI said this version of o3 is \u201coptimized for web browsing and data analysis,\u201d adding that \u201cit leverages reasoning to search, interpret, and analyze massive amounts of text, images, and PDFs on the internet, pivoting as needed in reaction to information it encounters.\u201d The model \u201cis also able to browse over user-uploaded files,\u201d the company said, and \u201cplot and iterate on graphs using [a Python] tool, embed both generated graphs and images from websites in its responses, and cite specific sentences or passages from its sources.\u201d\n\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\nOpenAI said it tested ChatGPT deep research using Humanity\u2019s Last Exam, an evaluation that includes more than 3,000 expert-level questions in a variety of academic fields. The o3 model powering deep research achieved an accuracy of 26.6%, which might look like a failing grade \u2014 but Humanity\u2019s Last Exam was designed to be tougher than other benchmarks to stay ahead of model advancements. According to OpenAI, the deep research o3 model came in way ahead of Gemini Thinking (6.2%), Grok-2 (3.8%), and OpenAI\u2019s own GPT-4o (3.3%).\n\nStill, OpenAI notes that ChatGPT deep research has limitations, sometimes making mistakes and incorrect inferences. Deep research may struggle to distinguish authoritative information from rumors, the company said, and often fails to convey when it\u2019s uncertain about something \u2014 and it can also make formatting errors in reports and citations.\n\nFor anyone worried about the impact of generative AI on students, or on anyone trying to find information online, this type of in-depth, well-cited output probably sounds more appealing than a deceptively simple chatbot summary with no citations. But we\u2019ll see whether most users will actually subject the output to real analysis and double-checking, or if they simply treat it as a more professional-looking text to copy-paste.\n\nAnd if this all sounds familiar, Google actually announced a similar AI feature with the exact same name less than two months ago.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "Google\u2019s X \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d this week announced its latest graduate. Heritable Agriculture is a data- and machine learning-driven startup aiming to improve how crops are grown.\n\nAs the firm noted in an announcement post published Tuesday, plants are incredibly efficient and impressive systems. \u201cPlants are solar powered, carbon negative, self-assembling machines that feed on sunlight and water,\u201d Heritable wrote.\n\nYet agriculture puts a massive strain on the planet and its resources, accounting for around 25% of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions. It\u2019s the planet\u2019s largest consumer of groundwater and can lead to soil erosion and water pollution via pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals.\n\nThe newly independent startup is approaching these global issues by doing what Google does best: analyzing massive datasets through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Data collection is the easy part, relatively speaking. The hard part is transforming all that data into actionable instructions for growers to help bring the 12,000-year-old industry into the 21st century.\n\nHeritable Architecture\u2019s seeds were planted by founder and CEO, Brad Zamft. The physics PhD served as a program officer and fellow at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation before spending a year as the chief scientific officer at a venture-backed startup called TL Biolabs. Eight months later, in late 2018, Zamft joined Google X, quickly becoming the project lead of what would become Heritable.\n\nImage Credits:Heritable Agriculture\n\n\u201cI was given broad purview to work on whatever I wanted, as long as it could scale to a Google-size business,\u201d Zamft tells TechCrunch. \u201cThat was the mandate. The idea of how do we get better at optimizing plants stuck with me and it gained traction with the leadership. We did a very good job moving through the gauntlet that is Google X.\u201d\n\nUsing machine learning, Heritable analyzes plant genomes to determine combinations that could improve crop production. By way of example, Zamft writes, \u201cBy understanding those genomes, the crops can then be bred with climate-friendly traits for increased yields, lower water requirements, and higher carbon storage capacity in roots and soil.\u201d\n\nThe models the company built were tested on thousands of plants, grown to those specifications within a \u201cspecialized growth chamber\u201d at X\u2019s Bay Area headquarters. The researchers also conducted field work at sites in California, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.\n\nZamft explains that CRISPR-fueled gene editing will eventually play a role in making plants \u201cprogrammable.\u201d For now, however, Heritable is focused on more conventional methods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not developing gene-edited plants, and genetic modification is not on our roadmap,\u201d says Zamft. \u201cGene editing may eventually come, but we\u2019re seeing a huge, unmet need for identifying what to breed and then doing better breeding \u2014 crossing a mother and father plant, not using the biotechnology to actually develop the [crop].\u201d\n\nImage Credits:Heritable Agriculture\n\nThe executive adds that the team is most immediately focused on commercializing the technology. Zamft did not reveal anything in the way of specific timelines or commercial partners. He did note, however, that Heritable has fittingly raised a seed round, featuring FTW Ventures, Mythos Ventures, and SVG Ventures.\n\nGoogle is an investor as well, with an undisclosed amount of equity in the young company.\n\nGoogle laid off dozens from X last January, as part of company-wide cuts. Under the leadership of lab head Astro Teller, the corporate incubator has begun to more aggressively spin off companies like Heritable.\n\nUpdate: Edited on 2/2 to clarify comments regarding GMOs.",

                "text": "Tech is upbeat about more companies going public this year, thanks in part to a new presidential administration that has promised to ease regulations and embrace industries like crypto and AI.\n\nBut there were already early signs of bullishness \u2014 especially in fintech \u2014 thanks to the wildly successful 2024 IPO of ServiceTitan, a SaaS platform for the trades.\n\nTechCrunch has compiled a chronological list of companies that have either announced that they plan to go public this year or have been reported to have confidentially filed for a 2025 IPO. And we\u2019ve also included those that filed as far back as 2023 and could finally go public this year.\n\nThe confidential filing process allows companies to submit their registration documents to regulators without making them public. But companies can delay or even withdraw their filings, depending on market conditions.\n\nFiled in 2025\n\neToro: The Israel-based trading platform filed confidentially in January 2025, reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation.\n\nVoyager Technologies: The space and defense tech startup confidentially filed in January 2025 and will likely be valued between $2 billion and $3 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company, based in Denver, sells a wide variety of defense\u2013 and space-based solutions, from propulsion technologies to airlocks.\n\nKarman Holdings: Another space and defense startup, Karman confidentially filed to go public in January 2025 and aims to raise up to $100 million in an IPO, it announced. The company, which specializes in missile technology, is based in Huntington Beach, California, and could be valued at $3 billion or more, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn the works since 2024\n\nChime: The digital bank confidentially filed to IPO in December 2024 and is looking to go public in 2025. The company, which is based in San Francisco, was last valued at $25 billion in 2021.\n\nKlarna: The Swedish buy now, pay later (BNPL) fintech confidentially filed in November 2024 for an IPO that\u2019s been a long time in the making, paving the way for it to go public sometime in the first half of 2025. Klarna\u2019s valuation rose to $14.6 billion in 2024.\n\nGenesys: The AI cloud startup announced its confidential filing in October 2024. The company is based in Menlo Park, California, and was most recently valued at $21 billion in 2021, it said in a press release at the time. The company is eyeing a 2025 IPO that could raise as much as $2 billion, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nClario: The clinical trial software provider confidentially filed in June 2024 seeking a $10 billion valuation. The company, based in Philadelphia, is looking to go public in 2025, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCerebras: The chip startup that aims to compete with Nvidia confidentially filed to IPO in August 2024, it announced. The company is based in Sunnyvale and is reportedly aiming to roughly double its current $4 billion valuation. The startup\u2019s plans are facing potential delays due to concerns from U.S. regulators about its close ties to G42, a UAE investor and its main customer, Reuters reported. Fun fact: OpenAI once considered buying Cerebras around 2017.\n\nCircle: The New York-based stablecoin provider filed confidentially in January 2024. While the exact timing remains unclear, in October 2024, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told Bloomberg it remained \u201cvery committed\u201d to going public despite prior delays. President Trump\u2019s embrace of crypto and promise to end government crackdowns on the industry could bolster its chances. The company\u2019s valuation is around $5 billion according to stock that\u2019s been trading on the secondary market, Coindesk reported.\n\nHarry\u2019s: The New York-based consumer company, which makes razors and other personal care items for men, has confidentially filed to go public, Reuters reported in March 2024, citing sources that the firm was nearing $1 billion in revenue and is profitable. The firm was last valued at $1.7 billion in 2021.\n\nOmada Health: The San Francisco-based diabetes startup confidentially filed in the summer of 2024, Business Insider reported, amid hopes of a warmer IPO market in 2025. It was last valued at $1 billion in 2022.\n\nTrying since 2023\n\nShein: The fast-fashion giant confidentially filed to IPO in the U.S. in 2023, but its hopes were dashed over congressional scrutiny of its supply chain and labor practices. It reportedly filed confidentially to IPO in the U.K. in 2024 and is still seeking to IPO as of 2025, although its U.K. foray is also meeting resistance from lawmakers there. Shein, headquartered in Singapore and with operations in China, was last valued at $45 billion in 2024, dropping from a $100 billion valuation in 2022.\n\nGeneral Atlantic: The New York-based growth equity investor, which has backed firms like Facebook and Airbnb, confidentially filed to go public in 2023, Bloomberg reported. The firm has $103 billion in assets under management. (Updated February 3, 2025 to reflect General Atlantic\u2019s correct headquarters and latest AUM). There\u2019s been no public updates on General Atlantic\u2019s IPO plans since its 2023 filing, though.\n\nOyo: The SoftBank-backed Indian hotel aggregator confidentially filed in India in March 2023, Reuters reported, after a prior attempt fell through. While that attempt didn\u2019t pan out, either, the company is reportedly planning to file again in the first quarter of 2025. Oyo hit a $3.8 billion valuation in 2024.",

                "text": "When accounting startup Bench abruptly failed last month, the shutdown was forced when the company\u2019s lenders called in the startup\u2019s loan. In late 2023, the digital freight company Convoy faced financial challenges, leading venture lending firm Hercules Capital to assume control of the company to recover its investments.\n\nDivvy Homes, which sold for about $1 billion to Brookfield Properties last week, has left some of the company shareholders without any payout, TechCrunch reported last week. Although the specific role of Divvy\u2019s lenders in the sale is unclear, the company borrowed $735 million from Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Cross River Bank, and others in 2021.\n\nAfter so many weak startups were funded in 2020 and 2021 with famously lax diligence, many of the weakest startups have already failed. But data suggests we haven\u2019t hit bottom yet, and many more will die in 2025. And venture debt will play a role after investing $41 billion across 2,339 deals, a record for the time in 2021, according to Silicon Valley bank.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the end of the rope for a lot of companies,\u201d said David Spreng, founder and CEO of venture debt provider Runway Growth Capital.\n\nConcerned about the future of their investments, lenders are increasingly pushing startups to sell themselves to minimize potential losses, Spreng believes.\n\nNearly every lender has troubled companies in their portfolio now, estimates John Markell, a managing partner at venture debt advisory firm Armentum Partners.\n\nWhile debt can help fast-growing startups meet their cash needs without selling off chunks of the company to VCs, it also increases the risk of negative outcomes. Too much debt compared to a startup\u2019s income or cash reserves can result in a forced fire sale, where a company is sold for a fraction of its previous value. Or lenders may resort to foreclosure, so they can claim any underlying assets used to secure the loan, to recover at least some of their investment.\n\nIf startups can convince new or existing VCs to inject more cash by buying more equity, they can avoid a lender taking action should they fall behind in payments or other aspects of their agreements. For instance, some venture debt agreements have liquidity and working capital ratio requirements. If a startup\u2019s cash falls too low, a lender could take action.\n\nBut investors are reluctant to keep funding startups that are growing too slowly to justify the sky-high valuations they achieved in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s so many troubled companies,\u201d Markell said. \u201cA lot of unicorns are not going to be in business soon.\u201d\n\nSpreng also predicts that many startups will have no choice but to sell for a low price or shut down this year. But for now, most lenders still hope these startups can find a home through a sale, even a fire sale.\n\nIn situations where lenders are forcing an acquisition, equity investors are generally not getting much of the money being paid, and often not even making their money back, said Markell. Losses on investments into startups are risks venture capitalists know will occur.\n\nWhen a sale does happen, Spreng says many of those transactions remain undisclosed due to unfavorable outcomes for venture investors. No one wants to take a victory lap when they lose money on a sale.\n\nHowever, since debt holders have priority in repayment, venture lenders are less likely to lose all of their capital.\n\nBut the risks associated with venture debt haven\u2019t slowed its appeal. In 2024, new venture debt issuance reached a 10-year high of $53.3 billion, according to PitchBook data. A significant portion of that capital was directed toward AI companies, with notable examples, including CoreWeave, which secured $7.5 billion in debt financing, and OpenAI, which obtained a $4 billion line of credit.",

                "text": "TikTok\u2019s potential U.S. ban has sparked a flurry of development within the open social web community. Several new applications are being built that could one day serve as a TikTok replacement for those who favor the open source, decentralized social network Bluesky and the technology that powers it, the AT Protocol.\n\nThough the TikTok ban is currently on pause after President Trump gave parent company ByteDance a 75-day extension to negotiate a deal, the fact that the government was able to take down TikTok in the first place has users worried about its future. Meanwhile, creators and small businesses are stressed over how the loss of TikTok could affect their income.\n\nBuilding a \u201cTikTok for Bluesky\u201d\n\nOne solution emerging to address the problem is Bluesky, a decentralized, open source social network where you can choose your own server and algorithm and adjust your moderation controls to your own needs. Plus, if you ever decide to change servers, you can move your account easily without losing your username, friends, or posts. You can even \u201crun your own Bluesky\u201d by setting up a personal data server or relay.\n\nDesigned for a future web, Bluesky allows people to take back control over their personal data and social activity from Big Tech \u2014 an effort also supported by the open social ecosystem called the fediverse, which runs on a different protocol and includes apps like Mastodon and others.\n\nThere are now several new projects underway to bring a video experience to Bluesky, whether that\u2019s as a video-first Bluesky client or as an entirely new app built on the same AT Protocol that Bluesky uses.\n\nBelow are a few of the video apps in various stages of development that are focused on catering to Bluesky users.\n\nBluescreen\n\nBuilt by Berlin developer Sebastian Vogelsang, who previously launched the Bluesky client app Skeets, Bluescreen is an upcoming app that will focus on videos posted to the Bluesky social network. Similar to his Instagram alternative Flashes, which is also in the works, Bluescreen is being built quickly thanks to Vogelsang\u2019s ability to reuse some of the same code from Skeets.\n\nImage Credits:Bluescreen (screenshot)\n\nLike Flashes, Bluescreen would offer a video-first Bluesky experience, as it filters your current Bluesky feeds and lists for video content, while also allowing uploads. Because it\u2019s built on Bluesky\u2019s network, your videos will also appear on your profile on the official Bluesky app, and people\u2019s comments and other engagement with those videos will show up in the Bluescreen app.\n\nVogelsang built his first prototype of Bluesky in just under two hours, he says, and has since been posting sneak peeks of the app on the Bluescreen account on Bluesky as it\u2019s further refined.\n\nThe app features a set of interaction buttons similar to what TikTok has, including Likes, Comments, Saves/Bookmarks, and more.\n\nReelo\n\nReelo represents a larger effort at building a TikTok-like app that appeals to Bluesky users, but unlike other efforts, it\u2019s not just a layer or filter on top of Bluesky\u2019s existing social network. Instead, Reelo is developing its own stand-alone app on the AT Protocol. That means Reelo will benefit from the same sort of transparency and control over your data as on Bluesky, but it will be free of the limitations of building on top of Bluesky directly.\n\nImage Credits:Reelo\n\nThis allows Reelo to support more features, including longer videos of up to three minutes, special effects, a music and sounds library, and later, livestreaming. Users will be able to directly post their video content on the app. As the company explains in a post on Bluesky, this makes for a \u201cricher, more tailored video experience\u201d compared with other apps built on Bluesky, like rival Skylight, for example.\n\nHowever, building its own app on AT Protocol instead of creating an app that\u2019s just a layer on Bluesky itself means a longer development timeline. Reelo expects to have the front end and back end completed by the end of February with a launch on March 20, after an initial testing period.\n\nImage Credits:Reelo\n\nLike most of the apps in development, Reelo also looks a lot like TikTok, with a vertical video feed and ways to like, comment, and share on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nSkylight\n\nThe team behind Skylight has been working to build a TikTok alternative after Mark Cuban said he was interested in backing potential startups in this space.\n\nThe team behind the app includes Seattle-based co-founders Victoria (\u201cTori\u201d) White, who has a background in building custom websites and apps, and React developer Reed Harmeyer. The founders are marketing Skylight as an \u201cAT Protocol TikTok,\u201d which is technically correct because Bluesky itself runs on AT Protocol.\n\nHowever, by building Skylight as a layer on top of the existing Bluesky platform, the app runs into limitations.\n\nBluesky\u2019s social network limits videos to up to 60 seconds in length and 50MB in size. In other words, if Skylight wants to add support for longer videos or other features, it would need to wait for Bluesky to change its own guidelines or develop its own dedicated app built on AT Protocol. (Skylight\u2019s founders declined an interview, so it\u2019s not clear what their long-term roadmap looks like.)\n\nSkylight does have an advantage of sorts, as its video-focused app is already in beta testing on iOS and Android, allowing early adopters to try it out ahead of its public release.\n\nApp features include likes, follows, comments, and profile pages. Video uploads are still in the works.\n\nVideos for Bluesky\n\nRecently launched on the App Store, the generically named Videos for Bluesky is another app built on top of Bluesky itself. This new app comes courtesy of \u201cMszPro,\u201d aka Hoshida Takiyoshi, an indie Japanese developer.\n\nTakiyoshi has always loved experimenting, having built around 60 apps to date, including the SoraSNS app offering combined access to decentralized networks Mastodon, Bluesky, Misskey, and Firefish.\n\nLike some of the others, Videos for Bluesky lets you browse videos posted to the Bluesky social network by vertically scrolling in a TikTok-like user interface with familiar Like, Repost, and Reply buttons.\n\nThe app also features user profiles, built-in search, follow buttons, and its own local \u201cFor You\u201d timeline featuring trending videos as well as ways to view other videos from people you follow or any custom feeds. In addition, the app is designed with an algorithm that will learn your interests over time, the developer says.\n\nIts recent updates have added support for other features like notifications and a new post composer focused on video uploads, among other things.\n\nWith a one-time \u201cPro\u201d unlock in-app purchase, users can access post analysis information and watch videos from a custom timeline.\n\nSoon, it will add NSFW filtering, a video recorder, style filters, downloads, bookmarks, and more.\n\nThe Videos for Bluesky app is iOS-only, but if there\u2019s enough user demand, the developer will consider building an Android version.\n\n\u201cBluesky is still a relatively new platform, but its well-documented protocol makes it easy for indie developers like myself to integrate new features,\u201d Hoshida notes. \u201cUnlike centralized social media, Bluesky\u2019s API doesn\u2019t require app makers to register for a developer account, which helps more people jump in and start building right away. And of course, since it is open source, developers can easily look into the code to see how to interact with various API features.\u201d\n\nLater, the developer plans to work on other social apps, including one for Bluesky focused on photos and a news reader for the fediverse.\n\nFlipboard\u2019s Surf\n\nWhile Flipboard\u2019s newest app Surf is more than just a video aggregator, the app recently added a video feed of its own after Bluesky added its custom video feed.\n\nSurf initially focused on video posts from Bluesky\u2019s trending video feed and others that included the hashtag #SkyTok,\u201d but it aims to soon personalize the feed to the end user in future developments. The latter would differentiate it from Bluesky\u2019s video feed and make it more interesting to each individual user.\n\nBluesky\u2019s video feed is available in the Surf app, where people can also build their own custom feeds to track all sorts of posts across the open social web, including Bluesky, Mastodon, RSS, and more.\n\nSurf is still in private beta testing, but a signup list is available for people who are interested.\n\nSurf\u2019s BookTok feed. Image Credits:Surf (screenshot)\n\nCanceled: BlueSky Reels\n\nOn 2/1/24, Merry said he was abandoning the project. The original information is below:\n\nBlueSky Reels (its website is not yet live) is another project that sees the potential for a TikTok replacement in the market. Developed by Craig Merry, the client will support video only, as well as basic user interactions. Over time, support for other personal data servers besides Bluesky\u2019s own could be included.\n\nThe app\u2019s content comes from Bluesky itself, though the goal is to add more features that Bluesky doesn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cMy main goal is to build an easy way for people to create curated feeds \u2014 with content that can be moderated directly \u2014 much like moderation in Reddit,\u201d Merry explains.\n\nUpdated after publication to reference which projects have since been canceled.",

                "text": "Thanks to the advent of cloud computing and distributed digital infrastructure, the one-person micro-enterprise is far from a novel concept. Cheap on-demand compute, remote collaboration, payment processing APIs, social media, and e-commerce marketplaces have all made it easier to \u201cgo it alone\u201d as an entrepreneur.\n\nBut what about scaling that one-person business into something meatier \u2014 an enterprise of unicorn proportions?\n\nHistorically, this would have been an unfathomably tough task, due to the skills and resources required not only to scale a product, but also to grow and maintain a sufficiently bountiful customer base. But AI agents could unshackle the would-be solo-preneurs of the world.\n\nAI agents are all about embedding human workflows into software, freeing the human to do more in less time. Agents can be assigned tasks, and they can make decisions with varying degrees of autonomy. Multiple AI agents could even collaborate on complementary tasks, paving the way for getting some real work done entirely autonomously.\n\nIn an interview last year with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman predicted this exact scenario.\n\n\u201cIn my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there\u2019s this betting pool for the first year that there is a one-person billion-dollar company,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWhich would have been unimaginable without AI \u2014 and now [it] will happen.\u201d\n\nIn a discussion at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos last week, a panel of entrepreneurs and investors also discussed the prospect of the single-person billion-dollar enterprise \u2014 and, more importantly, what this might mean for the future of employment.\n\nIn humans we trust\n\nRecent history reveals a slew of svelte billion-dollar companies. Microsoft doled out $2.5 billion for Minecraft maker Mojang, which had a reported 40 employees. Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion when the messaging app maker had just 55 employees. Two years before that, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion with just 13 employees in its ranks.\n\nThis proves that internet technology has already generated huge companies with minimal headcount. But this isn\u2019t the same as a one-person unicorn.\n\nKanjun Qiu, CEO of AI research lab Imbue, which is building agents capable of reasoning and coding, reckons that the kind of one-person businesses that AI will most likely help hit the big time are those where the product is largely self-serve.\n\n\u201cI think the places where it\u2019ll be easiest, and first, are \u2018bottoms up\u2019 \u2014 either consumer or prosumer \u2014 products that don\u2019t require large go-to-market teams,\u201d Qiu explained during the panel discussion. \u201cI think go to market is actually one of the places where it\u2019s going to be difficult to automate all of these relationships with other people.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to generating sales, it\u2019s not always the better product that wins out; it\u2019s the people behind the product that have done a better job of building trust with customers. So if you need to proactively sell your product, you still might need to staff up.\n\n\u201cThat human-to-human trust, I think, is still very necessary and very important,\u201d Qiu added.\n\nBenjamine Liu, CEO of AI drug development company Formation Bio, is bullish on the growing role that AI is having in his company and beyond.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re living in one of the most exciting areas to be building companies,\u201d Liu said at Davos. \u201cWe have PhD-level intelligence in our pockets, and we\u2019re beginning to see AI systems do the work of entire teams. I think in that world, AI-native companies have a pretty significant advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, Liu echoed Qiu\u2019s sentiments: Though the potential for one-person mega-businesses is real, it might not actually make sense from a business or entrepreneurial perspective \u2014 and it all comes down to the human condition that values relationships.\n\n\u201cThe potential to get there is earlier than people think,\u201d Liu said. \u201cMy view is that it\u2019s gonna take a long time, because being an entrepreneur is kind of a lonely journey, and you want a co-founder. Companies are still started by humans. I think you will want some people to share the journey with.\u201d\n\nSo the reality is, we might actually end up in a place where companies have always started out: a founding team with complementary skill sets. But rather than scaling through incremental hiring, they maintain that initial slenderness with AI agents plugging the gap.\n\nBut even if the fabled one-person unicorn never happens, there\u2019s little question that the oncoming agentic AI freight train will disrupt the workforce in a big way.\n\n\u201cThe era of AI employees\u201d\n\nIf this still all seems hypothetical, think again. Agentic AI is already entering the workforce in the form of lawyers like Harvey or software engineers such as Cognition\u2019s Devin.\n\nAI sales agents are also booming, with VC-backed companies such as Artisan boasting that it wants to replace the human workforce \u2014 as its dystopian billboard ad in San Francisco demonstrates.\n\nAn ad for AI company Artisan. Image Credits:Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nPlenty of other companies are also laying the foundation for agentic AI to flourish.\n\nLattice, an HR and \u201cpeople management\u201d platform last valued at $3 billion, is going further by giving \u201cdigital workers\u201d official employee records, meaning that its customers\u2019 AI agents actually show up in the organizational chart, replete with profile photo and a manager assigned to them.\n\nSarah Franklin, who joined Lattice as CEO last year, called this transition a \u201cgreat new age of collaboration,\u201d where humans and AI agents work side by side. And what this means is managing these agents in a similar fashion to humans, to foster transparency and accountability.\n\n\u201cWe want to prioritize the success of people as the primary, and when you\u2019re working with AI agents, it\u2019s important to understand what they are assigned to be doing,\u201d Franklin explained at Davos. \u201cIt\u2019s not saying that AI is human; it\u2019s more that we need to clearly identify where AI is. As AI speaks on behalf of brands and people, makes decisions on behalf of brands and people, and integrates with other systems, we need to be able to track that.\u201d\n\nLattice organizational chart with Piper AI included. Image Credits:Lattice\n\nBut if companies can operate at scale without any significant human workforce, what does this mean for society? People need to earn money; they need purpose \u2014 wouldn\u2019t society just implode on itself if people aren\u2019t able to work?\n\nAs with previous industrial revolutions, a common refrain around the AI revolution is that new jobs will crop up in the longer term \u2014 we just don\u2019t know what they are yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of job creation, too,\u201d Mitchell Green, founder of investment firm Lead Edge Capital, said at Davos. \u201cIf you think about when the iPhone came out in 2007 \u2014 Uber and Airbnb are now $100 billion companies. [They] could not have existed before this. Where the opportunities can be are the companies that we\u2019re not even thinking about yet \u2014 they are going to be these next giant businesses.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be a whole heap of pain in the short term, though. And as we\u2019re already seeing with Chinese AI sensation DeepSeek, the rate of AI\u2019s advance is significant in terms of cost-to-performance ratio of AI models. And this could be a key differentiator versus previous industrial and technological revolutions: We might not be able to adapt quickly enough.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a lot to talk about in terms of retraining and upskilling,\u201d Liu said. \u201cBut there\u2019s something quite unique about the pace of developments and how quickly these models are getting better, specifically where we\u2019re seeing these AI systems do the work of entire teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cManager of AIs\u201d\n\nThere was a general consensus among the panel that regardless of the rate of change, everyone will have to learn not only to live with AI, but also learn how to use it to thrive in the workplace.\n\nWith You.com, for example, companies can access its API to bring real-time web search to any large language model (LLM). While it offers its own suite of agents for specific tasks, companies can also create their own custom agents, choosing their preferred AI model and giving it instructions based on whatever sources of data they need to connect.\n\n\u201cWe, as CEOs, are going to be the first generation that manages people and AI,\u201d You.com CEO Richard Socher said at Davos. \u201cBut I think the most interesting change here is actually that every individual contributor, every employee, is going to become a manager of AIs. And in that sense, everyone is going to become kind of an entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nSo the jury is still very much out on whether we\u2019ll ever see a true one-person unicorn company. However, the principle behind the sentiment has already kind of been proven, as we\u2019ve seen with the insanely high value-to-headcount ratio of WhatsApp, which worked out at $345 million for each employee at the time Facebook bought it.\n\nEven Nvidia, with a market cap of more than $3 trillion, has a relatively slender workforce of fewer than 30,000 employees \u2014 that\u2019s the equivalent of around $100 million in value per employee.\n\nWith the right type of company, and the right execution, it\u2019s difficult to see how AI won\u2019t nudge these dollar figures north as the headcount heads south. But in all likelihood, it will just come down to whether there is a desire for one person to build alone, with enough entrepreneurial knowledge to embed a strong, defensible business model that someone else can\u2019t just replicate at the drop of a hat.\n\nBut whether society will be ready to handle this is an entirely different question.",

                "text": "India announced a new $1.15 billion Fund of Funds for startups on Saturday while unveiling sweeping regulatory reforms and an ambitious nuclear energy program, as New Delhi seeks to boost tech innovation and clean energy in the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting the federal budget for 2025-26, said the fund builds on earlier startup funding programs that have already deployed more than $1 billion from alternate investment funds. The new fund will have an \u201cexpanded scope\u201d compared to previous initiatives, though specific focus areas weren\u2019t detailed in the budget.\n\nShe also outlined plans for a High-Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms that will review all non-financial sector regulations, certifications, licenses, and permissions within a year. The initiative aims to strengthen \u201ctrust-based economic governance\u201d and ease compliance burdens for startups and technology companies, she said.\n\nNew Delhi will explore creating a separate Deep Tech Fund of Funds to catalyze next-generation startups working on advanced technologies, part of a broader push to strengthen India\u2019s position in emerging tech sectors.\n\nThese measures come as India\u2019s startup ecosystem emerges as a large jobs creator and a source of pride for the country, whose broader economy is projected to grow between 6.3% and 6.8% in the coming year. The government is betting on innovation and entrepreneurship to help achieve its longer-term goal of 8% growth needed to create adequate jobs for its young population.\n\nIndia startups have attracted over $100 billion in the past decade from investors, including Norges, SoftBank, Sequoia, Accel, Tiger Global, General Catalyst, and General Atlantic. Home to over 100 unicorn startups, India has also cemented its place as perhaps the last great growth market for Silicon Valley giants.\n\n\u201cThe first fund done a few years ago gave a huge fillip to the Indian venture capital industry,\u201d said Sanjeev Bikhchandani, a high-profile investor who is among the earliest backers of Zomato and Policybazaar. \u201cDozens of Indian VC funds got set up providing risk capital to hundreds of startups. India needs domestic venture capital.\u201d\n\nThe government also announced a $2.3 billion Nuclear Energy Mission aimed at developing at least five indigenous small modular reactors by 2033. The program is part of India\u2019s goal to achieve 100 gigawatts of nuclear energy capacity by 2047, with planned amendments to the Atomic Energy Act to enable private sector participation.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to ensure that our regulations keep up with technological innovations and global policy developments,\u201d Sitharaman said in her budget speech, announcing plans to decriminalize more than 100 provisions across various laws through a new Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0.\n\nThe government also extended tax benefits for startups by five years, allowing companies incorporated before April 2030 to claim certain deductions. For startups in 27 sectors deemed crucial for India\u2019s self-reliance goals, the government reduced guarantee fees to 1% while doubling their credit guarantee limit to $230,000.\n\nA new scheme targeting 500,000 first-time entrepreneurs, particularly women and those from scheduled castes and tribes, will provide term loans up to $24,000 over the next five years. The program builds on lessons from the existing Stand-Up India scheme, the minister said, aiming to broaden the startup ecosystem\u2019s reach.\n\nTo boost innovation in electronics manufacturing, a key focus area for tech startups, the government introduced a presumptive taxation scheme for non-residents involved in establishing manufacturing facilities. The budget also proposes \u201cBharatTradeNet,\u201d a unified platform for trade documentation and financing solutions that could benefit fintech startups.",

                "text": "A startup called Graze, which lets you build your own feeds for the Bluesky social network, has caught investors\u2019 attention. In addition to offering tools to easily build, customize, publish, and manage Bluesky feeds, Graze will soon allow feed creators to monetize their efforts with advertising, sponsored posts, and subscriptions.\n\nIn other words, Graze has stumbled upon a potentially viable business model for Bluesky before the social network itself has. Investors are taking notice, too: Graze is poised to announce the close of an oversubscribed pre-seed round of funding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing tech startups for 30 years and this is actually the craziest early-stage growth curve I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Graze co-founder and CEO Peat Bakke, speaking to the tool\u2019s adoption. \u201cWe went from zero \u2014 literally no traffic \u2014 to serving hundreds of thousands of unique people every day, tens of millions of content impressions. It\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s totally nuts. And it\u2019s all word of mouth.\u201d\n\nBakke is joined by co-founder Devin Gaffney, whose background is in social media and network analysis. The two began working together around 12 years ago on Little Bird, a social data analysis startup that relied on parsing Twitter\u2019s full feed, also known as the \u201cFirehose,\u201d to extract insights that could be useful to businesses.\n\nNow, they\u2019re working with the new generation\u2019s firehose: the \u201cJetstream\u201d offered by the open and decentralized social network Bluesky, which includes all the public posts from its now more than 30.3 million users, as well as future apps building on the underlying AT Protocol (or AT Proto, for short).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been interested in social networks, especially the nascent, growing social networks, to see what\u2019s happening next,\u201d Bakke says.\n\nImage Credits:Graze\n\nFollowing the events that drove millions to leave X to join Bluesky over the past year (and in even larger numbers after the U.S. presidential elections), the two founders seized the opportunity to start working in this space again.\n\nIn November, they began building Graze, a tool that gives Bluesky users the ability to \u201ccreate their own algorithm,\u201d so to speak, in the form of custom feeds built with complex logic, multiple filters, and rules. And its tools have rapidly taken off.\n\nGraze\u2019s growth is being helped by Bluesky\u2019s increasing popularity; the network added 23 million users over the past year.\n\nThough Bluesky looks and feels much like X, with its text-first nature, timeline, and DMs, it\u2019s offering a more democratized experience than traditional social networks. Instead of being centrally managed by a billionaire owner like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, anyone can run their own Bluesky Personal Data Server and set their own moderation controls. They can also build their own custom feeds to filter the network\u2019s content in a variety of ways, instead of only relying on Bluesky\u2019s algorithm.\n\nImage Credits:Graze\n\nGraze operates on Bluesky\u2019s Jetstream and works with AT Proto allowing people to build not just feeds, but also their own websites and experiences based on their filtered versions of the Jetstream.\n\nFor instance, one Graze customer is building a social media platform focused on professional cycling. With Graze\u2019s toolset, the customer can create different algorithms that identify and track specific teams and people, and also moderate the feed so it\u2019s \u201csafe for work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the tool that built top Bluesky feeds like News and BookSky.\n\nSeveral of the apps building their own \u201cTikTok for Bluesky\u201d-type video experiences are working with Graze\u2019s toolset, too.\n\nImage Credits:Graze\n\nWhat\u2019s potentially more interesting is that Graze is one of the only platforms working to monetize these custom Bluesky feeds, and it\u2019s doing it with the Bluesky team\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe startup has already quietly tested sponsored posts via its platform, which loads ads into custom feeds. (Because Bluesky doesn\u2019t have a way of differentiating ads in its product, these posts use a hashtag to flag themselves as ads.)\n\n\u201cTemu can\u2019t just come in and buy like $100,000 of advertising on [someone\u2019s] news feed,\u201d Bakke says. Instead, an advertiser offers a sponsored post and the number of impressions they\u2019re aiming for. \u201cThe feed operator has to consent to it. They maintain 100% editorial control over what goes into their feed.\u201d\n\nPlus, he says, if someone overruns their feed with ads, the users will likely abandon it. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a natural ecosystem balancing process,\u201d he says.\n\nThe ads can be set at whatever price point the feed\u2019s creator chooses. Initially, Graze\u2019s guidance is a $1 to $3 CPM rate. That\u2019s a quarter of what it costs to advertise on other social networks, but so far, the click-through rates and engagement are comparable, he says.\n\nImage Credits:Graze\n\nGraze also respects Bluesky\u2019s existing privacy guidelines \u2014 meaning the ads are not targeted by collecting users\u2019 personal data and or demographic info, but rather by which feeds the advertiser wants to reach. (Presumably, a cat food brand would do well advertising in a feed focused on cats, for example.)\n\nOther Graze tools will soon allow for private feeds, including those that require a subscription payment to access.\n\nWith both ads and subscriptions, Graze is eyeing a 30/70 revenue split, similar to the App Store, with creators taking the larger share. It will also work with brands and businesses to match them to feeds that would best serve their interests via a creator marketplace, launching next week.\n\nPortland-based Graze is currently a team of three, including front-end developer Andrew Lisowski, based in San Jose.",

                "text": "Perplexity, the venture-backed startup building AI-powered search products, has been sued in federal court for allegedly violating another company\u2019s trademark.\n\nIn a complaint filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, attorneys representing a company called Perplexity Solved Solutions accuse Perplexity of infringing on its trademark rights by using the brand \u201cPerplexity.\u201d\n\nPerplexity Solved Solutions, a Plano, Texas-based firm founded in 2017, applied to register the Perplexity trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in October 2021, according to the complaint.\n\nPerplexity Solved Solutions primarily sells HR and workplace collaboration software, including a unified dashboard for HR analytics and a videoconferencing tool called Perplexity Meet. The company secured a trademark registration by November 2022 and started promoting products on its site, perplexityonline.com, a domain that Perplexity Solved Solutions had registered in 2021.\n\nPerplexity and counsel for Perplexity Solved Solutions did not respond as of press time. TechCrunch will update the article if either party comments.\n\nThe Texas company alleges that AI startup Perplexity began infringing on its trademark \u201cin or around\u201d August 2022 to promote its AI-powered search engine. The month prior \u2014 July 2022 \u2014 Perplexity had registered the domain perplexity.ai, which the complaint also alleges is infringement.\n\n\u201cThe [Perplexity] website currently located at the infringing domain name prominently features the Perplexity [trademark],\u201d the complaint reads, \u201c[and] the infringing goods and services are highly similar to those offered by Perplexity [Solved Solutions] and appeal to a similar customer base. For example, Perplexity [Solved Solutions\u2019] \u2018Perplexity Meet\u2019 and defendant\u2019s \u2018Perplexity Spaces\u2019 both are software platforms that facilitate communication and collaboration among colleagues in businesses and other organizations.\u201d\n\nPerplexity Spaces, which the San Francisco-based AI startup launched for enterprise customers in October, are hubs with a customizable AI assistant and connectors to third-party platforms, apps, and file systems.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Perplexity has \u201csaturated the market\u201d with its infringing branding, including marketing across its various social media accounts. The AI startup declined to purchase the Perplexity trademark in September 2023 when offered, per the complaint, and instead opted to file for its own trademark with the USPTO, which is still pending.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Perplexity didn\u2019t comply with a cease and desist letter from Perplexity Solved Solutions\u2019 counsel, and it hasn\u2019t withdrawn its pending trademark application \u2014 despite efforts to oppose the application before the USPTO\u2019s trial and appeal board.\n\nAttorneys for Perplexity Solved Solutions say that Perplexity\u2019s use of its trademark is likely to sow confusion.\n\n\u201cIn fact, upon information and belief, consumers already have been confused,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cFor example, on numerous occasions, social media users have \u2018tagged\u2019 Perplexity in their posts about defendant\u2019s infringing goods and services.\u201d\n\nThe complaint alleges that Perplexity\u2019s conduct violates laws, including the Lanham Act \u2014 the U.S. federal law that regulates trademarks and unfair competition. Among other forms of legal relief, Perplexity Solved Solutions is seeking to bar Perplexity from using its trademark, as well as the trademark \u201cPerplexity AI,\u201d pay damages, and transfer ownership of any domains that include Perplexity branding.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest courtroom headache for Perplexity, which is currently battling a lawsuit filed by News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones and the NY Post over what the plaintiffs describe as a \u201ccontent kleptocracy.\u201d Many other news sites have expressed concerns that Perplexity closely replicates their content \u2014 just last October, The New York Times sent the startup a cease and desist letter.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "Stress isn\u2019t just bad for you \u2014 it\u2019s also bad for your employer. Factoring in absenteeism, diminished productivity, turnover, medical costs, and accidents, the nonprofit American Institute of Stress estimates that workplace stress costs U.S. businesses over $300 billion annually.\n\nOne way to measure stress is by monitoring cortisol levels. Even influencers know this, with \u201ccortisol face\u201d becoming a trending TikTok topic. But to approach things scientifically, the hormone needs to be measured throughout the day, because it\u2019s variation that matters the most.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the day, we should have the lowest levels,\u201d says Nutrix CEO Maria Hahn. Her company\u2019s newly unveiled hardware, cortiSense, which measures cortisol in saliva, recently won the CES Innovation Award 2025 in the Digital Health category.\n\nProviding patients with a device instead of having them go to a clinic isn\u2019t just more convenient; it also allows for tracking cortisol levels right after waking up, Hahn told TechCrunch.\n\nDeveloped with the support of the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland, cortiSense integrates with Nutrix\u2019s digital health platform, gSense, which includes a digital health platform, continuous glucose monitoring, AI-powered dietary management, and telemedicine.\n\nImage Credits:Nutrix\n\nThis also connects with Nutrix\u2019s initial focus: diabetes. While it pivoted its hardware roadmap toward cortiSense, the company\u2019s eye is still on chronic diseases. \u201cCortisol is a hormone that controls many other hormones, so it plays an important role in mental health, but also metabolic health,\u201d the Switzerland-based entrepreneur said.\n\nThis vision helped Nutrix gain support from Swiss innovation agency, Innosuisse, as well as private investment. The startup raised $4 million to date, including a previously unannounced $2.5 million seed round co-led by Polish impact fund Simpact and Japan deep tech fund OIST-Lifetime Ventures. Mayo Clinic also came on board, after meeting the team at CES 2024.\n\nThe startup is seeking to raise a large Series A round to fund its expansion, but its seed round has already kicked off the U.S. launch of cortiSense. With support from the Mayo Clinic, it is planning to open offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nNutrix isn\u2019t new to market expansion; its gSense platform is integrated with the public insurance system in Chile, a country where it received support from public program Start-Up Chile. In 2024, the Swiss health tech startup also launched operations in Mexico and Peru.\n\nWhat\u2019s new for Nutrix, however, is the pushback over a model that targets corporations, rather than consumers. While less common in the U.S., in countries such as Chile, Mexico, and Peru, health screenings are part of an employers\u2019 obligation to strive for employee wellness, with an understanding that private health data remains private.\n\nWith the U.S. now at the top of Nutrix\u2019s cortiSense roadmap, Hahn will have to get used to clarifying \u201cthe company will only get the aggregated data.\u201d And while a utilitarian pitch around the economic costs of job stress may seem distasteful to some, it may also serve as a reminder to employers that mental health is, indeed, health.\n\nCortisol is, \u201calso extremely important in women\u2019s health, especially in the perimenopause and menopause, but it\u2019s also a space that was very abandoned from the research and studies point of view,\u201d Hahn said. She now plans to use some of Nutrix\u2019s funding to conduct further investigations into these ties. \u201cFor me as a woman, that\u2019s also very important,\u201d she said.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe aftermath of DeepSeek\u2019s launch was arguably the biggest tech story of the week, especially for anyone keeping a close eye on public markets. But private companies, too, made headlines.\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nImage Credits:Voi Technology\n\nIn startup land, even a small profit is newsworthy and could lead to tomorrow\u2019s IPOs. In the meantime, we look at an M&A and some mission-driven startups fighting fire.\n\nScooting along: Swedish shared micromobility startup Voi reported its first profitable year. While modestly cash-positive, these 2024 results put the scooter and e-bike company in a better position to explore an IPO in upcoming years.\n\nMerging humanoids: OpenAI-backed Norwegian robotics startup 1X acquired Kind Humanoid, whose three-person team had started working with high-profile designer Yves B\u00e9har in 2024.\n\nOn track: French health insurance startup Alan revealed that it generated approximately $525 million in revenue in 2024 and confirmed its goal to reach profitability by 2026.\n\nFirefighters: In the aftermath of Southern California\u2019s recent devastating fires, TechCrunch\u2019s Tim De Chant rounded up startups that help measure and mitigate wildfire risk.\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nImage Credits:Mike Kane/Bloomberg / Getty Images\n\nSome significant rounds were announced this week, but perhaps even more interestingly, we saw some sizable valuation increases.\n\nHot like fusion: Nuclear startup Helion raised a $425 million Series F round of funding to help build a fusion reactor for Microsoft. This new round is smaller than the previous one, but valuation increased to $5.245 billion.\n\nPerking up: Barcelona-based corporate travel management platform TravelPerk closed a $200 million Series E round of funding at a $2.7 billion valuation \u2014 almost twice its previous $1.4 billion valuation.\n\nQuantum race: With $104 million in Series B funding, French startup Alice & Bob secured one of the larger rounds for a quantum computing startup in Europe.\n\nAI against cancer: Quibim, a Spanish startup that\u2019s developing AI models for medical imaging, raised a $50 million Series A round of funding to double down on its U.S. expansion plans. Its flagship product, QP-Prostate, focuses on prostate cancer detection.\n\nChallenging Autodesk: Motif, a startup developing architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) software, secured $46 million in seed and Series A funding to challenge its founders\u2019 former employer, Autodesk, with a next-generation design platform for buildings.\n\nBigger target: Regulatory filing revealed that 8VC, the Austin-based VC firm led by Palantir founder Joe Lonsdale, is hoping to raise around $1 billion for its sixth fund. Its previous flagship vehicle closed at $880 million in 2023.\n\nTaking it to 11: ElevenLabs, which works in the AI audio field, announced that it raised $180 million in a Series C round, valuing the company at $3.3 billion post-money. Andreessen Horowitz and ICONIQ Growth are co-leading investment.\n\nLast but not least\n\nImage Credits:Stefan Herrick / Getty Images\n\nApologies for ending on a negative note, but data suggests that 2025 will be another brutal year of startup wind-downs. However, AngelList CEO Avlok Kohli provided a more positive outlook, noting that these figures \u201care still very low relative to the number of companies that were funded across both years.\u201d",

But it\u2019s gearing up to raise billions more, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPer The WSJ, OpenAI is in talks to secure up to $40 billion in a funding round that would value the startup at $340 billion. SoftBank would lead the round, pouring between $15 billion to $25 billion into the ChatGPT maker, according to The WSJ.\n\nShould OpenAI successfully close the round, it\u2019d be a remarkable feat for the startup, which was valued at $157 billion in October. The WSJ says that OpenAI would use the capital to fund its money-losing business operations and fulfill its commitment to Stargate, its ambitious project to build AI data centers across the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, OpenAI reportedly lost around $5 billion against revenues of $3.7 billion. The losses could mount. In conjunction with partners including SoftBank, OpenAI aims to contribute billions of dollars to Stargate to start.",

                "text": "Last week, Founders Fund partner Delian Asparouhov realized he hadn\u2019t checked on his genetics in a while. He clicked open a dashboard created by Nucleus Genomics, a Founders Fund-backed startup that gets saliva samples sequenced and then compares the DNA results to extensive data linking health issues to genes. Within seconds, he concluded that he had a predisposition for schizophrenia, a sky-high IQ, and prostate cancer. \u201cBummer,\u201d he shrugged.\n\nIf Asparouhov\u2019s reaction seems nonchalant, it\u2019s only because he and the Nucleus team he backed are dreaming much, much bigger. Imagine a world where your medical treatments are tailored to your genetics or where every couple gets their DNA sequenced before having kids together \u2014 or a world where, as Asparouhov imagines, dating apps have a \u201ckid simulation\u201d that meshes your genetic tests together and shows you what a child might inherit.\n\nToday, Nucleus is a step closer to that future. The company, founded by 25-year-old Kian Sadeghi, announced a $14 million Series A, bringing its total funding to about $32 million. Investors like Alexis Ohanian\u2019s Seven Seven Six, Balaji Srinivasan and SpaceX alum Achal Upadhyaya have all rallied behind Sadeghi\u2019s vision for widely available genetic testing.\n\n\u201cDNA is actually the kind of ultimate health test,\u201d Sadeghi said. \u201cSo one swab and you get your analysis on about 800-plus conditions. And that\u2019s going to be rapidly growing over the next several months, until it\u2019s effectively every common and rare disease known.\u201d\n\nNucleus is possible because the cost of genome sequencing has plummeted in recent years. In 2007, genome sequencing cost close to $1 million. Today, Nucleus, staffed by a team of PhDs and genetic experts, charges $400 to send a saliva sample to a third-party sequencer and then analyze the results, telling users a host of potential illnesses they may be at risk for. Sadeghi believes that, in the next five years, \u201cthe cost of sequencing the genome is going to be negligible,\u201d and everyone will have \u201ctheir genome on their smartphone.\u201d\n\nSadeghi\u2019s dream began with tragedy. One night, his cousin died in her sleep from a previously unknown genetic condition. The loss permanently altered his life\u2019s path. He dropped out of college and moved home, where his schedule was as follows: wake up, meditate for an hour, scribble gene-related company plans in a notebook for 12 hours, meditate for another hour. \u201cI do believe in the soul,\u201d he reflected. \u201cI\u2019ve meditated every day for, I think, five years.\u201d\n\nHis year of work and meditation birthed Nucleus \u2014 and sent Sadeghi into the orbit of Silicon Valley\u2019s most famous contrarians. He first met Peter Thiel at Hereticon, the Founder Fund bash that celebrates all that is controversial (Sadeghi recalls a particularly exciting exorcist). It was a fitting place to meet, considering all the controversy that Sadeghi would court.\n\nLast year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which tells users how much their genetics correlate with markers for high intelligence. Sadeghi puts a huge asterisk next to that claim: There is still much we don\u2019t know about the connection between genes and IQ, and, even if we did, genetics can only account for so much, while one\u2019s environment handles the rest.\n\nGeneticist Sasha Gusev called into question the accuracy of Nucleus\u2019s IQ tests (Sadeghi then published a lengthy defense), and others pointed out that Nucleus\u2019s IQ tests could lead to discrimination and stigmatization. Sadeghi\u2019s approach is also markedly different from competitors: Back in 2018, 23andMe told the MIT Technology Review it purposefully wouldn\u2019t release consumer information around genetics and intelligence for fear of \u201cmisinterpretation.\u201d\n\nBut Sadeghi and Asparouhov believe that the average American should have as much information about their genetics as possible. Asparouhov finds the hesitancy around Nucleus IQ \u201cvery odd,\u201d adding that if we\u2019re able to acknowledge genetic advantages in athletes (like, say, Michael Phelps\u2019 astonishing wingspan), why wouldn\u2019t we do the same for IQ? \u201cExperts claim that they know what\u2019s best for you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s best to just give consumers the information that\u2019s available to them and let them decide.\u201d\u2019\n\nAs Nucleus acquires more customers, Asparouhov says the company\u2019s insights will get even better, the results on a Nucleus dashboard automatically updating with new information. \u201cAt some point maybe there will be, like, phenotypic reporting, where you tell Nucleus, I have blue eyes, I have brown hair, maybe you come in for an IQ test, etc., and that actually improves the model,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if linking things like blue eyes, blonde hair, and IQ could be interpreted as eugenics, he clarified with a laugh, \u201cI said brown hair!\u201d\n\nThen, miming the same hand motion that Elon Musk performed following President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Asparouhov joked, \u201cMy heart goes out to you.\u201d",

                "text": "Cushion, a fintech startup that described itself as the \u201cPlaid for buy now, pay later (BNPL),\u201d has shut down.\n\nOn Thursday, founder and CEO Paul Kesserwani posted on LinkedIn about the decision to wind down the company at the end of 2024.\n\nIn the post, Kesserwani said that \u201cdespite bringing multiple new fintech products to market,\u201d Cushion \u201cdidn\u2019t reach the scale needed to sustain the business.\u201d\n\nFounded in late 2016, San Francisco-based Cushion had raised a total of $21.6 million from investors such as Afore Capital, Flourish Ventures, Vestigo Ventures, Better Tomorrow Ventures, and 500 Global.\n\nIts last publicly announced raise was in May, 2022 when it closed a $12 million Series A. Its post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nKesserwani did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCushion offered a consumer app that sucked in the transaction history from its users\u2019 bank accounts, determined what fees had been assessed and then conducted negotiations on their behalf to get a refund. It was designed, Kesserwani told TechCrunch in 2019, to be incentive-aligned with consumers by only taking a commission on any returned cash.\n\nKesserwani got the idea for Cushion after leaving his job at Twitter. While taking some time off to think about what he wanted to do next, he was helping his parents manage their bank accounts while they were traveling for work in Lebanon. Due to bank security policies, his parents weren\u2019t able to log into their accounts from Lebanon, and eventually, they faced a mountain of banking fees as their accounts went unattended. As Kesserwani investigated, he turned to his own accounts, and realized he had also been paying fees to the tune of $400 that he had no memory of agreeing to.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s LinkedIn post, Kesserwani said that Cushion had automated bank fee negotiation and reached $3 million ARR in 10 months and processed over $300 million in BNPL loans. He added that the company had onboarded over 1 million consumers over time, with more than 200,000 paying customers.\n\nWrote Kesserwani: \u201cI gave Cushion everything I had for 8+ years. While the outcome wasn\u2019t what we hoped for, we built something that moved the industry forward \u2014 and I\u2019m proud of that. As for me, I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nData suggests that 2025 is expected to be another brutal year for startup shutdowns. In late December, another fintech \u2014 Bench \u2014 shut down abruptly only to be acquired days later.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

                "text": "Serial entrepreneur and former recording artist Victor D. Lombard, also known as DIVINE, announced this week the launch of a new company, in partnership with RAKIM, one of hip-hop\u2019s most influential emcees.\n\nThe company is called Notes, a fintech specifically for independent urban musicians and creators. It provides the knowledge and tools to help artists manage their careers \u2014 such as providing resources to help them apply for loans or access credit scores. It provides financial literacy and music business education by offering multimedia courses, step-by-step guides on financial management and how to monetize music. It also has a feature that lets artists write lyrics and connect with their peers on the app.\n\nNotes has a \u201cdigital passport\u201d feature that lets users track credit scores, access loans, and budget tools. The company partners with lenders and creditors and earns a commission on referral fees when users apply for loans through the platform.\n\nThe app, currently in beta, has AI tools, including an AI voice assistant in RAKIM\u2019s voice. It is hoping to launch fully at the end of February.\n\nChatting with TechCrunch, DIVINE said he was inspired to launch this company alongside RAKIM because of his firsthand experience dealing with the indie urban music scene and the hardship that comes when trying to fund a career. It\u2019s well-documented, through movies, profiles, and music itself, that breaking into the music industry is hard and expensive. For every big-named artist that hits the charts, there are thousands simply struggling to get by.\n\n\u201cThe music industry, as it stands, is structured to take advantage of artists through exploitative contracts and limited financial resources, forcing them into predatory deals just to survive,\u201d he said. Having spent the past 10 years building fintech companies, he also said he\u2019s come to view technology as a great equalizer, a way to redistribute control back to artists and creators. DIVINE previously founded fintech BLAK, which focused on serving underbanked communities, and built Solvent, a neobank also for underserved communities.\n\nSo he thought of Notes, to allow musicians to educate themselves, fund their own projects, and build careers on their own terms. He said now is a good time for this product because indie artists and creators are becoming more powerful and influential, yet still lack a lot of financial support.\n\nDIVINE then pitched the company to RAKIM\u2019s team as a way to partner, and \u201cit became an even more powerful force for change,\u201d DIVINE said.\n\nRAKIM was part of the hip-hop group Eric B. & RAKIM, which made waves during the golden age of hip-hop during the 80s. Their album \u201cPaid in Full\u201d was listed as one of the Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone in 2020 as it was one of the first albums to use funk samples and influenced the flow and lyricism of rappers to come.\n\nDIVINE says he\u2019s known RAKIM for 20 years and always admired him for \u201cstaying true to his artists and principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I started ideating Notes, I knew it had to be more than just a fintech platform, it had to be a movement rooted in the values of empowerment and cultural authenticity,\u201d DIVINE continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why it made perfect sense to bring RAKIM on board.\u201d\n\nHip-Hop legend Rakim. Image Credits:Felix Manuel Photography\n\nThe partnership sees RAKIM come on as a co-founder and as an advisory board member. RAKIM\u2019s son, Tahmell Griffin, also holds an executive position at the company.\n\nRight now, the company is self-funded, but DIVINE said the company is seeking a pre-seed round. Notes offers freemium and premium subscription memberships. It seeks to make money from its subscription models and referral fees. He says this company is the culmination of his music and technological journey.\n\n\u201cI want Notes to shift the narrative from artists being exploited by record labels to artists owning their financial future and career success,\u201d DIVINE said. \u201cIf an artist can use Notes to get funding for their next album, learn how to run their music career as a business, and leverage community collaboration for growth, then we\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d",

                "text": "Schools have faced an onslaught of cyberattacks since the pandemic disrupted education nationwide five years ago, yet district leaders across the country have employed a pervasive pattern of obfuscation that leaves the real victims in the dark, an investigation by The 74 shows.\n\nAn in-depth analysis chronicling more than 300 school cyberattacks over the past five years reveals the degree to which school leaders in virtually every state repeatedly provide false assurances to students, parents, and staff about the security of their sensitive information. At the same time, consultants and lawyers steer \u201cprivileged investigations\u201d that keep key details hidden from the public.\n\nThis article was copublished with The 74, a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here.\n\nIn more than two dozen cases, educators were forced to backtrack months\u2014and in some cases more than a year\u2014later after telling their communities that sensitive information, which included, in part, special education accommodations, mental health challenges, and student sexual misconduct reports, had not been exposed. While many school officials offered evasive storylines, others refused to acknowledge basic details about cyberattacks and their effects on individuals, even after the hackers made student and teacher information public.\n\nThe hollowness in schools\u2019 messaging is no coincidence.\n\nThat\u2019s because the first people alerted following a school cyberattack are generally not the public nor the police. District incident response plans place insurance companies and their phalanxes of privacy lawyers first. They take over the response, with a focus on limiting schools\u2019 exposure to lawsuits by aggrieved parents or employees.\n\nThe attorneys, often employed by just a handful of law firms\u2014dubbed breach mills by one law professor for their massive caseloads\u2014hire the forensic cyber analysts, crisis communicators, and ransom negotiators on behalf of the schools, placing the discussions under the shield of attorney-client privilege. Data privacy compliance is a growth industry for these specialized lawyers, who work to control the narrative.\n\nThe result: Students, families, and district employees whose personal data was published online\u2014from their financial and medical information to traumatic events in young people\u2019s lives\u2014are left clueless about their exposure and risks to identity theft, fraud, and other forms of online exploitation. Told sooner, they could have taken steps to protect themselves.\n\nSimilarly, the public is often unaware when school officials quietly agree in closed-door meetings to pay the cybergangs\u2019 ransom demands in order to recover their files and unlock their computer systems. Research suggests that the surge in incidents has been fueled, at least in part, by insurers\u2019 willingness to pay. Hackers themselves have stated that when a target carries cyber insurance, ransom payments are \u201call but guaranteed.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, there were 121 ransomware attacks on US K-12 schools and colleges, according to Comparitech, a consumer-focused cybersecurity website whose researchers acknowledge that number is an undercount. An analysis by the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes reported 265 ransomware attacks against the education sector globally in 2023\u2014a 70 percent year-over-year surge, making it \u201cthe worst ransomware year on record for education.\u201d\n\nDaniel Schwarcz, a University of Minnesota law professor, wrote a 2023 report for the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology criticizing the confidentiality and doublespeak that shroud school cyberattacks as soon as the lawyers\u2014often called breach coaches\u2014arrive on the scene.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between misleading and, you know, technically accurate,\u201d Schwarcz told The 74. \u201cWhat breach coaches try to do is push right up to that line\u2014and sometimes they cross it.\u201d\n\nWhen Breaches Go Unspoken\n\nThe 74\u2019s investigation into the behind-the-scenes decisionmaking that determines what, when, and how school districts reveal cyberattacks is based on thousands of documents obtained through public records requests from more than two dozen districts and school spending data that links to the law firms, ransomware negotiators, and other consultants hired to run district responses. It also includes an analysis of millions of stolen school district records uploaded to cybergangs\u2019 leak sites.\n\nSome of students\u2019 most sensitive information lives indefinitely on the dark web, a hidden part of the internet that\u2019s often used for anonymous communication and illicit activities. Other personal data can be found online with little more than a Google search\u2014even as school districts deny that their records were stolen and cyberthieves boast about their latest score.",

                "text": "The rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI platform, heightened concerns this week over the United States\u2019 AI dominance as Americans increasingly adopt Chinese-owned digital services. With ongoing criticism over alleged security issues posed by TikTok\u2019s relationship to China, DeepSeek\u2019s own privacy policy confirms that it stores user data on servers in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, security researchers at Wiz discovered that DeepSeek left a critical database exposed online, leaking over 1 million records, including user prompts, system logs, and API authentication tokens. As the platform promotes its cheaper R1 reasoning model, security researchers tested 50 well-known jailbreaks against DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot and found lagging safety protections as compared to Western competitors.\n\nBrandon Russell, the 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore\u2019s power grid and trigger a race war. The trial provides a look into federal law enforcement\u2019s investigation into a disturbing propaganda network aiming to inspire mass casualty events in the US and beyond.\n\nAn informal group of West African fraudsters calling themselves the Yahoo Boys are using AI-generated news anchors to extort victims, producing fabricated news reports falsely accusing them of crimes. A WIRED review of Telegram posts reveals that these scammers create highly convincing fake news broadcasts to pressure victims into paying ransoms by threatening public humiliation.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal, hacking groups with known ties to China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea are leveraging AI chatbots like Google Gemini to assist with tasks such as writing malicious code and researching potential attack targets.\n\nWhile Western officials and security experts have long warned about AI's potential for malicious use, the Journal, citing a Wednesday report from Google, noted that the dozens of hacking groups across more than 20 countries are primarily using the platform as a research and productivity tool\u2014focusing on efficiency rather than developing sophisticated and novel hacking techniques.\n\nIranian groups, for instance, used the chatbot to generate phishing content in English, Hebrew, and Farsi. China-linked groups used Gemini for tactical research into technical concepts like data exfiltration and privilege escalation. In North Korea, hackers used it to draft cover letters for remote technology jobs, reportedly in support of the regime\u2019s effort to place spies in tech roles to fund its nuclear program.\n\nThis is not the first time foreign hacking groups have been found using chatbots. Last year, OpenAI disclosed that five such groups had used ChatGPT in similar ways.\n\nOn Friday, WhatsApp disclosed that nearly 100 journalists and civil society members were targeted by spyware developed by the Israeli firm Paragon Solutions. The Meta-owned company alerted affected individuals, stating with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that at least 90 users had been targeted and \u201cpossibly compromised,\u201d according to a statement to The Guardian. WhatsApp did not reveal where the victims were located, including whether any were in the United States.\n\nThe attack appears to have used a \u201czero-click\u201d exploit, meaning victims were infected without needing to open a malicious link or attachment. Once a phone is compromised, the spyware\u2014known as Graphite\u2014grants the operator full access, including the ability to read end-to-end encrypted messages sent via apps like WhatsApp and Signal.",

                "text": "Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022, hackers and security researchers have tried to find holes in large language models (LLMs) to get around their guardrails and trick them into spewing out hate speech, bomb-making instructions, propaganda, and other harmful content. In response, OpenAI and other generative AI developers have refined their system defenses to make it more difficult to carry out these attacks. But as the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek rockets to prominence with its new, cheaper R1 reasoning model, its safety protections appear to be far behind those of its established competitors.\n\nToday, security researchers from Cisco and the University of Pennsylvania are publishing findings showing that, when tested with 50 malicious prompts designed to elicit toxic content, DeepSeek\u2019s model did not detect or block a single one. In other words, the researchers say they were shocked to achieve a \u201c100 percent attack success rate.\u201d\n\nThe findings are part of a growing body of evidence that DeepSeek\u2019s safety and security measures may not match those of other tech companies developing LLMs. DeepSeek\u2019s censorship of subjects deemed sensitive by China\u2019s government has also been easily bypassed.\n\n\u201cA hundred percent of the attacks succeeded, which tells you that there\u2019s a trade-off,\u201d DJ Sampath, the VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, tells WIRED. \u201cYes, it might have been cheaper to build something here, but the investment has perhaps not gone into thinking through what types of safety and security things you need to put inside of the model.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have had similar findings. Separate analysis published today by the AI security company Adversa AI and shared with WIRED also suggests that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a wide range of jailbreaking tactics, from simple language tricks to complex AI-generated prompts.\n\nDeepSeek, which has been dealing with an avalanche of attention this week and has not spoken publicly about a range of questions, did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about its model\u2019s safety setup.\n\nGenerative AI models, like any technological system, can contain a host of weaknesses or vulnerabilities that, if exploited or set up poorly, can allow malicious actors to conduct attacks against them. For the current wave of AI systems, indirect prompt injection attacks are considered one of the biggest security flaws. These attacks involve an AI system taking in data from an outside source\u2014perhaps hidden instructions of a website the LLM summarizes\u2014and taking actions based on the information.\n\nJailbreaks, which are one kind of prompt-injection attack, allow people to get around the safety systems put in place to restrict what an LLM can generate. Tech companies don\u2019t want people creating guides to making explosives or using their AI to create reams of disinformation, for example.\n\nJailbreaks started out simple, with people essentially crafting clever sentences to tell an LLM to ignore content filters\u2014the most popular of which was called \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d or DAN for short. However, as AI companies have put in place more robust protections, some jailbreaks have become more sophisticated, often being generated using AI or using special and obfuscated characters. While all LLMs are susceptible to jailbreaks, and much of the information could be found through simple online searches, chatbots can still be used maliciously.",

                "text": "The Chinese generative artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek has had a meteoric rise this week, stoking rivalries and generating market pressure for United States\u2013based AI companies, which in turn has invited scrutiny of the service. Amid the hype, researchers from the cloud security firm Wiz published findings on Wednesday that show that DeepSeek left one of its critical databases exposed on the internet, leaking system logs, user prompt submissions, and even users\u2019 API authentication tokens\u2014totaling more than 1 million records\u2014to anyone who came across the database.\n\nDeepSeek is a relatively new company and has been virtually unreachable to press and other organizations this week. In turn, the company did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about the exposure. The Wiz researchers say that they themselves were unsure about how to disclose their findings to the company and simply sent information about the discovery on Wednesday to every DeepSeek email address and LinkedIn profile they could find or guess. The researchers have yet to receive a reply, but within a half hour of their mass contact attempt, the database they found was locked down and became inaccessible to unauthorized users. It is unclear whether any malicious actors or authorized parties accessed or downloaded any of the data.\n\n\u201cThe fact that mistakes happen is correct, but this is a dramatic mistake, because the effort level is very low and the access level that we got is very high,\u201d Ami Luttwak, the CTO of Wiz tells WIRED. \u201cI would say that it means that the service is not mature to be used with any sensitive data at all.\u201d\n\nExposed databases that are accessible to anyone on the open internet are a long-standing problem that institutions and cloud providers have slowly worked to address. But the Wiz researchers note that the DeepSeek database they found was visible almost immediately with minimal scanning or probing.\n\n\u201cUsually when we find this kind of exposure, it\u2019s in some neglected service that takes us hours to find\u2014hours of scanning,\u201d says Nir Ohfeld, the head of vulnerability research at Wiz. But this time, \u201chere it was at the front door.\u201d Ohfeld adds that the \u201ctechnical difficulty of this vulnerability is the bare minimum.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say that the trove they found appears to have been a type of open source database typically used for server analytics called a ClickHouse database. And the exposed information supported this, given that there were log files that contained the routes or paths users had taken through DeepSeek\u2019s systems, the users\u2019 prompts and other interactions with the service, and the API keys they had used to authenticate. The prompts the researchers saw were all in Chinese, but they note that it is possible the database also contained prompts in other languages. The researchers say they did the absolute minimum assessment needed to confirm their findings without unnecessarily compromising user privacy, but they speculate that it may even have been possible for a malicious actor to use such deep access to the database to move laterally into other DeepSeek systems and execute code in other parts of the company\u2019s infrastructure.",

                "text": "This week started off with a bang and just kept going. In the wee hours of Saturday night, TikTok cut off access to users in the United States ahead of Sunday\u2019s deadline that forced Apple and Google to remove the video-sharing app from their app stores. While TikTok was dark, US users raced to get around the TikTok ban while several other unexpected apps saw their access to Americans severed as well. By midday on Sunday, however, TikTok access was already coming back in the US. By Monday night, newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump had signed an executive order delaying the TikTok ban by 75 days.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made good on his promise to free Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road dark-web market, where users sold drugs, guns, and worse. Ulbricht had spent more than 11 years behind bars after he was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and later sentenced to life in prison. Trump\u2019s decision to pardon Ulbricht is largely seen as linked to the support he\u2019s received from the libertarian cryptocurrency community, which has long considered the Silk Road creator a martyr.\n\nAs the world enters the second Trump era, WIRED sat down with Jen Easterly, who recently left her top spot as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to discuss the cyber threats facing the US and CISA\u2019s uncertain future as the frontline watchdog against nation-state hackers and other digital security threats facing the US.\n\nLastly, we detailed new research that revealed how trivial bugs had exposed Subaru\u2019s system for tracking the locations of its customers\u2019 vehicles. The researchers found they could access a web portal for Subaru employees that allowed them to pinpoint up to a years\u2019 worth of a car\u2019s location\u2014down to the parking spots they use. The flaws are now patched, but Subaru employees still have access to sensitive driver location data.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nA US judge in New York this week found that the FBI\u2019s practice of searching data on US persons under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without obtaining a warrant is unconstitutional. FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform \u201cbackdoor searches\u201d for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. \u201cTo hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702\u2014including those of US persons\u2014that can later be searched on demand without limitation,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nAn \u201cissue\u201d with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare\u2019s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples\u2019 internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person\u2019s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image\u2014and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.\n\nIn one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency\u2019s advisory committees. This includes the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was investigating widespread attacks on the US telecommunications system by the China-backed hacker group Salt Typhoon. US authorities revealed in mid-November that Salt Typhoon had embedded itself in at least nine US telecoms for espionage purposes, potentially exposing anyone using unencrypted calls and text message to surveillance by Beijing. While the future of the CSRB remains uncertain, sources tell reporter Eric Geller that their investigation into Salt Typhoon\u2019s attacks is effectively \u201cdead.\u201d",

                "text": "Curry and Shah reported their findings to Subaru in late November, and Subaru quickly patched its Starlink security flaws. But the researchers warn that the Subaru web vulnerabilities are just the latest in a long series of similar web-based flaws they and other security researchers working with them have found that have affected well over a dozen carmakers, including Acura, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, and many others. There\u2019s little doubt, they say, that similarly serious hackable bugs exist in other auto companies' web tools that have yet to be discovered.\n\nIn Subaru's case, in particular, they also point out that their discovery hints at how pervasively those with access to Subaru's portal can track its customers' movements, a privacy issue that will last far longer than the web vulnerabilities that exposed it. \u201cThe thing is, even though this is patched, this functionality is still going to exist for Subaru employees,\u201d Curry says. \u201cIt's just normal functionality that an employee can pull up a year's worth of your location history.\u201d\n\nWhen WIRED reached out to Subaru for comment on Curry and Shah's findings, a spokesperson responded in a statement that \u201cafter being notified by independent security researchers, [Subaru] discovered a vulnerability in its Starlink service that could potentially allow a third party to access Starlink accounts. The vulnerability was immediately closed and no customer information was ever accessed without authorization.\u201d\n\nThe Subaru spokesperson also confirmed to WIRED that \u201cthere are employees at Subaru of America, based on their job relevancy, who can access location data.\" The company offered as an example that employees have that access to share a vehicle's location with first responders in the case when a collision is detected. \u201cAll these individuals receive proper training and are required to sign appropriate privacy, security, and NDA agreements as needed,\u201d Subaru's statement added. \u201cThese systems have security monitoring solutions in place which are continually evolving to meet modern cyber threats.\u201d\n\nResponding to Subaru's example of notifying first responders about a collision, Curry notes that would hardly require a year's worth of location history. The company didn't respond to WIRED asking how far back it keeps customers' location histories and makes them available to employees.\n\nShah and Curry's research that led them to the discovery of Subaru's vulnerabilities began when they found that Curry's mother's Starlink app connected to the domain SubaruCS.com, which they realized was an administrative domain for employees. Scouring that site for security flaws, they found that they could reset employees' passwords simply by guessing their email address, which gave them the ability to take over any employee's account whose email they could find. The password reset functionality did ask for answers to two security questions, but they found that those answers were checked with code that ran locally in a user's browser, not on Subaru's server, allowing the safeguard to be easily bypassed. \u201cThere were really multiple systemic failures that led to this,\u201d Shah says.\n\nThe two researchers say they found the email address for a Subaru Starlink developer on LinkedIn, took over the employee's account, and immediately found that they could use that staffer's access to look up any Subaru owner by last name, zip code, email address, phone number, or license plate to access their Starlink configurations. In seconds, they could then reassign control of the Starlink features of that user's vehicle, including the ability to remotely unlock the car, honk its horn, start its ignition, or locate it, as shown in the video below.",

                "text": "When I walk into Jen Easterly\u2019s office on a bright January day in Arlington, Virginia, I\u2019m greeted by a giant shark head lurking on the floor. I instantly spot a Rubik\u2019s Cube\u2014an Easterly hallmark\u2014emblazoned with the logo of the organization she\u2019s run for the past three and a half years\u2014the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which President Donald Trump created during his first term.\n\nEasterly, who is 56 years old, jumps to her feet to greet me. The first thing that hits me is her denim pants, which have a dragon on one leg and a serpent on the other. Then she launches into updates on CISA\u2019s animated \u201cSecure Our World\u201d video series and, in the same breath, laments that she hasn\u2019t had time for a private guitar lesson in weeks. Seemingly a regular day on the job for her, except for one thing. As of January 20, Inauguration Day, Easterly\u2019s time at CISA would be over. Trump had fired the agency\u2019s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn\u2019t asked to stay. Rumors are swirling that CISA programs\u2014or even the entire agency\u2014may soon be on Trump\u2019s chopping block.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group called Salt Typhoon spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year\u2014warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.\n\nThe work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn\u2019t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be \u201csmaller\u201d and \u201cmore nimble.\u201d And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board\u2014who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches\u2014were let go.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nWhen Easterly officially became the agency\u2019s second director, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack\u2014SolarWinds. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn\u2019t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or\u2014more realistically\u2014get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.\n\nIt takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley\u2019s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she\u2019s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there\u2019s her eclectic style\u2014high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks\u2014but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions.

                "text": "The United States\u2019 recent regulatory action against the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok prompted mass migration to another Chinese app, the social platform \u201cRednote.\u201d Now, a generative artificial intelligence platform from the Chinese developer DeepSeek is exploding in popularity, posing a potential threat to US AI dominance and offering the latest evidence that moratoriums like the TikTok ban will not stop Americans from using Chinese-owned digital services.\n\nDeepSeek, an AI research lab created by a prominent Chinese hedge fund, recently gained popularity after releasing its latest open source generative AI model that easily competes with top US platforms like those developed by OpenAI. However, to help avoid US sanctions on hardware and software, DeepSeek created some clever workarounds when building its models. On Monday, DeepSeek\u2019s creators limited new sign-ups after claiming the app had been overrun with a \u201clarge-scale malicious attack.\u201d\n\nWhile DeepSeek has several AI models, some of which can be downloaded and run locally on your laptop, the majority of people will likely access the service through its iOS or Android apps or its web chat interface. Like with other generative AI models, you can ask it questions and get answers; it can search the web; or it can alternatively use a reasoning model to elaborate on answers.\n\nDeepSeek, which does not appear to have established a communications department or press contact yet, did not return a request for comment from WIRED about its user data protections and the extent to which it prioritizes data privacy initiatives.\n\nAs people clamor to test out the AI platform, though, the demand brings into focus how the Chinese startup collects user data and sends it home. Users have already reported several examples of DeepSeek censoring content that is critical of China or its policies. The AI setup appears to collect a lot of information\u2014including all your chat messages\u2014and send it back to China. In many ways, it\u2019s likely sending more data back to China than TikTok has in recent years, since the social media company moved to US cloud hosting to try to deflect US security concerns\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a panic over Chinese AI to remind people that most companies in the business set the terms for how they use your private data\u201d says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. \u201cAnd that when you use their services, you\u2019re doing work for them, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nWhat DeepSeek Collects About You\n\nTo be clear, DeepSeek is sending your data to China. The English-language DeepSeek privacy policy, which lays out how the company handles user data, is unequivocal: \u201cWe store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\u201d\n\nIn other words, all the conversations and questions you send to DeepSeek, along with the answers that it generates, are being sent to China or can be. DeepSeek\u2019s privacy policies also outline the information it collects about you, which falls into three sweeping categories: information that you share with DeepSeek, information that it automatically collects, and information that it can get from other sources.",

They\u2019ll frequently stoop to blackmail\u2014and are constantly creating more devious approaches to incorporate it into their grifts. In recent months, cybercriminals have taken their blackmailing efforts up a notch, creating realistic-looking \u201cnews\u201d videos that claim their victims are wanted for crimes.\n\nScammers based in West Africa, likely in Nigeria, and going under the broad umbrella of the Yahoo Boys, have increasingly been seen sending blackmail victims videos likely using AI-generated news anchors in a bid to pressure victims into paying up. A WIRED review of posts on Telegram by self-styled Yahoo Boys shows the cybercriminals are impersonating television stations based in the US and sharing tutorials about how to create the blackmailing videos.\n\nThe videos follow a sinister pattern. One video\u2014which can be seen in the image below\u2014uses CNN\u2019s logo and branding to impersonate the news organization, with text at the bottom of the screen describing the \u201cbreaking news.\u201d On the screen, a likely AI-generated newsreader starts talking.\n\n\u201cGood day.

In the video, the man, who is the target of the scam, is named, and a photograph of him appears onscreen.\n\nOther videos seen by WIRED feature different news readers and names of news channels, but they also show more graphic photos of the potential blackmail targets, including nude and explicit images. In one \u201cnews\u201d clip, the screen is split in two, with a photo of a man\u2019s face on one side and the other side is a short video clip of him allegedly masturbating.\n\nDavid Maimon, the head of fraud insights at SentiLink and a professor at Georgia State University who first spotted the CNN video in December, says the fraudsters have made a number of \u201cdisturbing\u201d changes to their blackmailing tactics in recent months, including trying to humiliate people and potentially targeting those outside of English-speaking countries.",

                "text": "After an opaque and uncertain saga, TikTok went dark on millions of phones across the United States on Saturday evening around 10:30 pm EST. Google Play and Apple\u2019s App Store both pulled the app late Saturday as well. If it was already installed prior to Saturday evening, the app is still there on your phone, but launching it only reveals a pop-up warning about the ban. As the deadline loomed, TikTok users had been bracing for the change and flooding other platforms, including the Chinese social app Xiaohongshu or \u201cRedNote.\u201d But if you\u2019re not quite ready to give up the latest skin-care hacks, budgeting tips, and pet tortoise influencers, there are some options for circumventing the ban and continuing to use the platform.\n\n\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d the app alert reads. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d Other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut and Lemon8, also disappeared from US app stores.\n\nSuch a ban has never existed in the US before, so the technical methods being employed to implement it are still evolving, and circumvention techniques may need to change as well. The law driving the situation, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), doesn\u2019t make it illegal to have TikTok on your phone. And, notably, it also doesn\u2019t say that TikTok itself has to stop the app from working in the US.\n\nNonetheless, the company said in the days before the law took effect that it planned to make the app inaccessible to US users\u2014a level of cooperation and accommodation that the outgoing Biden White House called a \u201cstunt\u201d on Saturday afternoon. Even if TikTok itself had obligations under the law, the Biden White House had signaled that it did not plan to enforce the ban before Trump took office on Monday.\n\nRather than putting the pressure on TikTok, PAFACA requires app stores and cloud hosting services to stop doing anything to \u201cdistribute, maintain or update\u201d TikTok. That puts the pressure on Apple and Google to stop new users from downloading TikTok, as well as infrastructure providers like Oracle to keep new content or software updates from reaching the app\u2019s users. Over time, TikTok would likely degrade and become unusable.\n\nOfficials in India banned TikTok in 2020, and the company also proactively blacked out the app in that case. When Indian users who already had the app installed tried to launch it, a pop-up appeared telling them that they couldn\u2019t access the service.\n\nDevashish Gosain, a network analysis researcher and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, says that in India, TikTok users must remove their Indian SIM card from their phone or use an international SIM card and then run a VPN in order to load content in the app.",

                "text": "In March 2020, Frank van der Linde entered the immigration line for European Union citizens at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol international airport. Linde, a Dutch citizen and human rights advocate, was returning home from outside the EU, and the immigration officer asked him a series of questions about his trip. Linde thought it was a random check; after a few minutes, he was cleared for entry. But unbeknownst to Linde, his answers were recorded and shared with a Dutch public prosecutor, who was collecting information on Linde\u2019s movements.\n\nThe officer had been tipped off about Linde\u2019s arrival that day through a seemingly innocuous action that occurs whenever you board a flight to the United States, much of Europe, and increasingly anywhere in the world\u2014the exchange of detailed personal data about each traveler between airlines and governments. The data, which is retained about you for years, is increasingly valuable for technology companies that are experimenting with using algorithms that could decide who is allowed to cross international borders.\n\nLinde, who is publicly outspoken about homeless rights, anti-racism, and pacifism, was first secretly flagged by Dutch police in 2017 as a person of interest under an Amsterdam municipality counter-terrorism program. In July 2018, Linde had a \u201cweird feeling\u201d that he was being monitored; he would eventually sue the government over 250 times under freedom of information laws to uncover the extent of the surveillance. Although Linde was removed in 2019 from the city\u2019s watchlist, later receiving a personal apology from the mayor of Amsterdam, the scrutiny continued. When Linde learned that the police had put his name on an international travel alert, he wondered if they were also using his travel data to track him.\n\nIn October 2022, Linde requested his flight records from the government. The data, called a Passenger Name Record (PNR), is a digital trail of information related to an airline ticket purchase. PNR records are sent by most commercial airlines to the destination country some 48 to 72 hours before departure. While PNR records might seem innocuous, they contain highly sensitive personal information, including the traveler\u2019s address, cell phone number, date of flight booking, where the ticket was purchased, credit card and other payment information, billing address, baggage information, frequent flyer information, general remarks related to the passenger, date of intended travel, complete travel itinerary, names of accompanying travelers, travel agency information, historical changes to the ticket, and more.\n\nIn December 2022, over two years after Linde passed through Schiphol, the Dutch PNR office, called a Passenger Information Unit, handed over 17 travel records to Linde. They stated that they had not shared his data with others, but Linde was suspicious. He swiftly filed an appeal. In March 2023, the Dutch government admitted that in fact they had shared Linde\u2019s PNR details three times with the border police, including ahead of the March 2020 flight, when the immigration officer was instructed to covertly extract information. (They also shared an additional seven flight records that they claimed to have only discovered on a second search.)\n\nAs Linde reviewed his PNR records, he was surprised to find that some of the travel data the government had on him was incorrect\u2014some flights were missing, and in four cases, the government had records of flights he never took. For example, one PNR record from 2021 stated Linde traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland; Linde says he had reserved the ticket, but changed his plans and never boarded the plane. \u201cWhat do companies do with the data?\u201d Linde asked as he scrolled through copies of the PNR records on his laptop. \u201cIf commercial companies help to analyze data that\u2019s incorrect, you could draw all kinds of conclusions.\u201d",

                "text": "In my testing, speeds with TunnelBear were competitive with the other options listed here. One of my favorite parts of TunnelBear is the free trial option, which makes it easy to test-drive it and see what your speeds are like without committing. TunnelBear has fewer geographic server locations than some of our other options, but unless you're traveling abroad or need to get around a specific geo-restriction, that shouldn't matter for most users.\n\nTunnelBear costs $3.33 per month if you buy one year upfront.\n\nThe Fastest VPN\n\nNordVPN has been in our guide for years, though after some bad customer-service incidents we pulled it out to retest. After testing NordVPN over the past six months, and repeatedly asking customer service to solve problems, which they did, I am adding it back to our list of recommendations.\n\nIn 2020 Nord Security merged with Surfshark VPN (recommended above). Both VPNs continue to operate independently, but there is considerable overlap in the services offered. Nord's parent company is based in Panama, which is outside the 14-Eyes Alliance, meaning there's nothing forcing NordVPN to gather user data.\n\nNordVPN has much to recommend about it, perhaps the highlight being speed, especially when it comes to upload speeds, which makes it a popular choice for sharing torrents. I like the built-in ad and tracking blocker in the mobile app, and NordVPN is great for unblocking entertainment sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Max. The NordVPN apps offer a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and it supports multi-hop VPN connections. NordVPN supports a good variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and what the company calls NordLynx, which is based on WireGuard.\n\nNordVPN's track record for privacy is pretty good too. In October 2024, in connection with a criminal investigation, NordVPN received a binding warrant from the Panamanian government to provide user data. The company says \u201cthe only information we were able to provide was payment-related data and confirmation about the existence of the account tied to the email address provided to us by the authorities.\u201d\n\nBest for High-Risk Use Cases\n\nIf you're in a situation where personal security is of the utmost importance, do not rely on a VPN. Use Tor (ideally through Tails) instead. Using the Tor network accomplishes some of the same things as a VPN, but it's different. Tor provides anonymity, meaning no one can figure out who you are, but not necessarily privacy. People still might be able to see what you're doing, they won't know it's you doing it. (VPNs provide privacy because no one can see what you're doing while you're going out of a VPN tunnel, but you don't have anonymity because the VPN provider knows who you are.)\n\nTor is simple to set up. All you need to do is download the Tor browser and it will connect you to the web. Once connected to the Tor network, you can browse the web normally. Except everything will be slower. When using Tor, your request for a website hops around the Tor network, bouncing between servers, before emerging and connecting to the site you want to visit. This makes Tor slow, sometimes incredibly slow, but that's necessary to protect your anonymity. And yes, you can combine a VPN with Tor, though that's somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.\n\nOther VPNs We\u2019ve Tried\n\nExpressVPN: We also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it.\n\nWe also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it. Google One VPN: Google One VPN was part of Google One but is slated to be shut down. We never recommended it\u2014let us not forget that Google has repeatedly been caught collecting data that it said it wasn't collecting, which is not what you want to hear from a VPN provider. Nor do we recommend the VPN that comes with Google Fi or the one available in Pixel phones. If you aren't paying for your VPN, two things will happen: It will either shut down, or you will be the thing being sold. Most of the VPNs we recommend are about $5 per month; real privacy is worth $5 a month.\n\nThere are a lot of VPNs out there, but most are not worth your money. If all you want to do is circumvent some Netflix geographic restrictions, then just about any of them will work (we still suggest sticking with our recommended options, but if you can't be stopped, then carry on). For anything more serious, like actually protecting your privacy and data, learn to use Tor. Yes, it's a little technical, but trust me, it's worth learning how to do if your life, family, and job are at stake.\n\nThe Best Free VPN\n\nAs noted above, ProtonVPN has a free version. It's limited to a single device and there are only three servers to connect to which means it can be slow. There are no logs, no ads, and no other limits. In my testing, it was slower than the paid account, but it does work. Several other VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, here's the details on NordVPN's refund policy.\n\nOther than that, it's worth keeping in mind the adage, \u201cIf you're not paying for it, you are the product.\u201d Do not trust a VPN that isn't taking your money (and don't trust many that are either). The good news is that all the picks above offer free trials, which allow you to evaluate how well each VPN will work in your unique situation and for your needs.",

                "text": "If you're worried about possible expansions of government surveillance and access to your information, or simply want to do some digital purging so you're not saddled with old data, there are a bunch of concrete steps you can take to protect your digital privacy. Just as archeologists study carefully preserved tombs and ancient trash heaps to gain insight into historic communities, your long-forgotten digital footprint could be more revealing and sensitive than you realize. And while you can't control everything\u2014particularly information stolen in breaches or gathered by data brokers\u2014you probably have a digital attic full of old data that you can delete or download and save offline. First stop? Old message histories.\n\nChats are a good place to start your digital decluttering. Their real-time nature makes it easy to forget that if you don't have auto-delete turned on for a chat (or if a platform doesn't offer it), all of those \u201cbe there in 10 minutes,\u201d \u201cwait, what color is this dress???\u201d and \u201cwelp, I have covid\u201d messages are still knocking around years later. If you sent them on an end-to-end encrypted platform like Signal or WhatsApp, they only exist on your device and the devices of the other person or people you were chatting with. That means that for governments or bad actors to read them, they would need direct control of your device\u2014a good level of protection, though not foolproof.\n\nCrucially, though, messages that you sent on regular web apps like Slack, Facebook Messenger for most of its history, and Google Chat/Hangouts/Gchat are sitting on a cloud server somewhere. And while they're probably stored in an encrypted form to protect against theft, the platform itself has the keys to decrypt your data and would be able to comply with government requests for it, no matter how old the information is. Sure, all of those \u201cu up?\"s may not seem significant now, but years and years of chat histories can paint a very detailed picture of your life, associations, political beliefs, and past movements and activity.\n\n\u201cDoing a good digital cleaning from time to time is a great habit, especially with social media and old chat messages,\u201d says Kenn White, security principal at the database developer MongoDB and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. \u201cWho you were five or 10 years ago is probably very different than who you are today, so it's worth asking yourself, \u2018Do I really need those seven-year-old inside jokes and sarcastic posts? Do I need to keep old group chat messages and carry them forward to every new phone I get?\u2019\u201d\n\nSome programs like Apple's Messages make it easy to auto-delete your chat histories after a set period of time. On iOS, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and then scroll and tap Keep Messages. Then choose whether to keep messages forever, for one year, or for 30 days before auto-deleting.\n\nOn the free version of Slack, data older than a year is automatically deleted. The company keeps data forever on paid plans, unless the administrator sets up rolling deletion. This is useful if you have an active Slack with your friends, but most people who use Slack at work don't make decisions about administrative policies and can't control deletion. Keep this in mind for any communication you do on an employer's platforms. You may be able to go through and delete messages or files one by one, but you likely won't have the access to make policy decisions about automatic or batch deletion.",

If you own a more recent smartphone from Apple, you might be able to use precision location data to find the hidden device.\n\nMonths after the release of the AirTag, Apple launched the Tracker Detect app for Android phones, where users had to initiate the scan. Google and Apple since have continued working together to make it easier for Android phones to detect unwanted AirTag trackers and for Apple phones to spot Android trackers. Recently, Google rolled out automatic smartphone alerts for unknown Bluetooth trackers, similar to what iPhone owners receive for AirTags.\n\nPhotograph: Google\n\nWhile some guides to finding AirTags recommend using Bluetooth scanners, Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation does not consider this method to be reliable for tracker searching. \u201cI have tried using various Bluetooth scanners in order to detect AirTags, and they do not work all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nMillions of Americans still do not own a smartphone. Without a device on hand, you must rely on visual and audible clues to find any hidden AirTags. The circular white disc is slightly larger than a quarter. As reported by The New York Times, Ashley Estrada discovered an AirTag lodged under her license plate, and her video documenting the incident was viewed more than 22 million times on TikTok.\n\nWhen the AirTag was first released, the tracker would emit a beeping noise if away from the owner for longer than three days. Apple has since shortened the time to 24 hours or less. Despite the update, you might not want to rely only on sound to detect AirTags. Numerous videos on YouTube offer DIY instructions to disable the speaker, and noiseless versions of the trackers were even listed for a short time on Etsy.\n\nWhat if I Find One?\n\nThe best way to disable an AirTag is to remove the battery. To do this, flip the AirTag so the metallic side with an Apple logo is facing you. Press down on the logo and turn counterclockwise. Now you will be able to remove the cover and pop out that battery.\n\nApple\u2019s support page for the AirTag suggests reaching out to the police if you believe you are in a dangerous situation. \u201cIf you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement, who can work with Apple to request information related to the item,\u201d the support page reads. \u201cYou might need to provide the AirTag, set of AirPods, Find My network accessory, and the device's serial number.\u201d One way to figure out the serial number is to hold the top of an iPhone or other near-field-communication-enabled smartphone to the white side of an AirTag. A website with the serial number will pop up.",

                "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He\u2019s vowed to jail his political foes and journalists. A Republican-controlled government could further restrict abortion and transgender rights. Influential conservatives have called for a crackdown on left-leaning activist groups, a replay of Trump\u2019s hardline attitude against protesters in his first administration.\n\nTo carry out all of those spoken and unspoken threats, the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress will tap into\u2014and may very well expand\u2014the American government\u2019s vast surveillance machinery, and they appear poised to use it more than any administration in recent US history.\n\nThat means now is the time for anyone in an at-risk group, those who communicate with them\u2014or even those who want to normalize privacy and create cover for more vulnerable people\u2014to think about how they can upgrade their data security and surveillance resistance ahead of a second Trump administration.\n\n\u201cUndocumented immigrants, Muslims, pregnant people, journalists, really anyone who doesn't support him\u201d need to reconsider their personal privacy safeguards, says Runa Sandvik, a former digital security staffer for The New York Times and the founder of the security firm Granitt, which focuses on protecting members of civil society. \u201cWhatever platforms you're on, whatever devices you have, you need to have a sense of what kind of data you're generating and then use the controls available to limit who can see what you're doing.\u201d\n\nProtection from surveillance comes in two forms: top-down legal and policy limits on data collection, and bottom-up technological protections in the hands of the targets of that surveillance. A new era looms just weeks ahead where Trump and his allies control all three branches of government and tech companies will very likely bend to their will\u2014as evidenced by the Silicon Valley CEOs\u2019 race to congratulate the president-elect.\n\nThat may leave the technology you choose to use as a last line of defense, says Harlo Holmes, the director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \u201cThis is the last recourse of a lot of people in vulnerable positions,\u201d says Holmes. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to increase our efforts to make sure that people have the best tools in their hands and their pockets to maintain their privacy. And it's going to matter more and more.\u201d\n\nAhead of that impending new reality, WIRED asked security and privacy experts for their advice for hardening personal privacy protections and resisting surveillance. Here are their recommendations.\n\nEncrypted Communications\n\nSecuring your data starts with securing your communications, and securing your communications means using end-to-end encryption.\n\nEnd-to-end encrypted messengers like Signal, WhatsApp, and Apple\u2019s iMessage and FaceTime are all designed to encrypt your messages and phone calls such that no one can decrypt and access your conversations other than the recipient\u2014not even the company that offers the service. That\u2019s very different from traditional calls and texts, which are subject to law enforcement interception and data requests to your phone carrier.",

                "text": "Brandon Russell, arguably one of the most influential figures in the American neofascist revival of the past decade, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore\u2019s power grid and trigger a race war.\n\nThe 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization that was responsible for five homicides and a number of bomb plots before the FBI dismantled it in 2020, Russell was arrested by federal agents in February 2023 along with his girlfriend, Sarah Clendaniel. If convicted of his charges of conspiring to destroy an energy facility, Russell could face 20 years behind bars thanks to a prior conviction and the potential penalty for his current charges.\n\nRussell\u2019s case represents one of the last gasps of the Biden administration\u2019s hard-charging approach to tackling violent far-right extremism that is all but guaranteed to change during US president Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office. It also offers a unique look inside federal law enforcement\u2019s investigation into an insidious accelerationist propaganda network that mixes neo-Nazi ideology with nihilist, Columbine-style violence to inspire mass casualty events in the United States and beyond.\n\nRussell allegedly hatched the plot to black out Baltimore while, according to prosecutors, participating in a noxious, prolific propaganda network hellbent on fomenting violence and chaos. The Terrorgram Collective, which took its name following a massive influx of neo-Nazis to Telegram at the end of the last decade, ran several channels on the messaging\u200b\u200b app and developed a series of \u201chow-to\u201d domestic terrorism manuals that sought to inspire disaffected young men and women into committing mass casualty events. Terrorgram is currently designated a \u201ctier one\u201d extremism threat by the US Department of Justice.\n\nTo date, Terrorgram has released four publications\u2014a blend of ideological motivation, mass-murder worship, neofascist indoctrination, and how-to manuals for chemical weapons attacks, infrastructure sabotage, and ethnic cleansing. Court records indicate there are at least three unreleased Terrorgram Collective compendiums, including \u201cThe Saint Encyclopedia\u201d of the far-right mass killers they venerate, including Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Timothy McVeigh; and \u201cThe List,\u201d a collection of politicians, government officials, business leaders, journalists, activists, and other people deemed legitimate assassination targets.\n\nThe screeds appear to have directly inspired a series of ideologically motivated attacks around the world, including a 2022 mass shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, successful attacks on power infrastructure in North Carolina and similar failed plots in Baltimore and New Jersey, and a stabbing spree in the Turkish city of Eskisehir. There are currently more than a dozen separate federal prosecutions around the United States that involve people alleged to be core Terrorgram Collective members or individuals allegedly inspired toward violent attacks on infrastructure or civilians.\n\nIn one of the Biden administration\u2019s last policy moves against right-wing extremism, on January 13, the State Department formally classified the Terrorgram Collective as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a listing usually reserved for militant groups that hold territory and have a formal real-world paramilitary structure as opposed to a loose propaganda network that seeks to inspire mass casualty events. While it is not unique\u2014the British Home Office formally proscribed Terrorgram as an extremist organization last May, and Russell\u2019s Atomwaffen Division was banned by the UK, Australia, and Canada\u2014it is likely to be the last such action taken toward neo-Nazi groups by the United States government for the foreseeable future.",

                "text": "A little over 11 years and three months ago, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in the science fiction section of a public library in San Francisco, caught with his laptop still logged in to the Silk Road, the world\u2019s first dark-web drug market that he created and ran under the pseudonym the Dread Pirate Roberts.\n\nNow, after being sentenced to life in prison and spending more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht will walk free, thanks to Donald Trump\u2014and to the president\u2019s ever-closer ties to the American cryptocurrency world.\n\n\u201cI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\u201d president Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, misspelling Ulbricht's last name. \u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!\u201d\n\nFor close to two and a half years after Ulbricht created the Silk Road in 2011, the dark-web site facilitated the sale of vast amounts of narcotics, as well as counterfeit documents, money laundering services and, at times, guns, for hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin payments. After the FBI located the Silk Road\u2019s server in Iceland in 2013 and arrested then 29-year-old Ulbricht in San Francisco, he was convicted on seven charges relating to the distribution of narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, as well as a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d statute\u2014sometimes known as the \u201ckingpin statute\u201d\u2014usually reserved for mob bosses and cartel leaders. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison, a punishment beyond even the 20-plus years that prosecutors in the case requested.\n\nSince then, a Free Ross movement has steadily pressed for Ulbricht\u2019s release, first in a failed appeal, then in petitions for clemency. Many of Ulbricht\u2019s supporters have long argued that the Silk Road was a principled libertarian experiment in free trade, one in which Ulbricht allowed only \u201cvictimless crime\u201d\u2014despite prosecutors arguing during his trial that at least six people died of opioid overdoses from drugs linked to the Silk Road. They point out that Ulbricht never actually sold or possessed drugs himself, and rather ran a website that facilitated their sale. And they argue that by moving the sale of narcotics online, he reduced violence in the drug trade and committed no violence himself.\n\nThat argument has been complicated, however, by allegations that Ulbricht tried to have six people killed who presented a threat to him or the Silk Road. Ultimately all six alleged murders-for-hire were fake\u2014one was staged by undercover DEA agents and five more were a scam. Ulbricht was charged with only one of those alleged paid killings in a separate prosecution in Maryland, which was then dropped after he received a life sentence in his New York trial. But evidence presented at Ulbricht\u2019s trial showed him allegedly arranging those killings and even pinpointed transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that showed a payment for them from Ulbricht\u2019s laptop to the would-be killer.\n\nThose allegations of murders-for-hire, in fact, dissuaded the first Trump administration from granting clemency to Ulbricht. The White House in 2020 considered freeing Ulbricht but ultimately rejected the idea because of the alleged role of violence in the case, according to one former government official involved in the process who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity.\n\nSince then, however, the Trump administration has shifted its stance on Ulbricht\u2019s case\u2014in part, perhaps, due to its embrace of the libertarian cryptocurrency community, for whom Ulbricht has become a martyr and cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. At the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, last May, then presidential candidate Trump promised to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence \u201con day one\u201d if reelected. (Ultimately, day one passed with no clemency for Ulbricht, even as Trump pardoned more than a thousand participants in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, though Trump ally Elon Musk promised in a post to X on Monday evening that \u201cRoss will be freed too.\u201d)",

                "text": "As the Biden administration comes to a close, the White House released a 40-page executive order on Thursday aimed at shoring up federal cybersecurity protections and placing guardrails on the US government\u2019s use of AI. WIRED also spoke with outgoing US ambassador for cyberspace and digital policy, Nathaniel Fick, about the urgency that the Trump administration not cow to Russia and China in the global race for technical dominance. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel details to WIRED the threats facing US telecoms, at least nine of which were recently breached by China\u2019s Salt Typhoon hackers. Meanwhile, US officials are still scrambling to get a handle on multiple espionage campaigns and other data breaches, with new revelations this week that a breach of AT&T disclosed last summer compromised FBI call and text logs that could reveal the identity of anonymous sources.\n\nHuione Guarantee, the massive online marketplace that researchers say provides an array of services to online scammers, is expanding its offerings to include a messaging app, stablecoin, and crypto exchange and has facilitated a whopping $24 billion in transactions, according to new research. New findings indicate that GitHub\u2019s efforts to crack down on the use of deepfake porn software are falling short. And WIRED did a deep dive into the opaque world of predictive travel surveillance and the companies and governments that are pumping data about international travelers into AI tools meant to detect people who might be a \u201cthreat.\u201d\n\nBut wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nChina spies, the US spies, everybody spies. Mutual espionage is a geopolitical game played by virtually every nation in the world. So when the US government singles out a single hacker for espionage-focused intrusions, naming him and targeting him with sanctions, he must have spied aggressively\u2014or effectively\u2014enough to have made powerful people very angry.\n\nThe US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Yin Kecheng, a 39-year old Chinese man accused of being involved in both the breach of nine US telecommunications companies carried out by the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon, as well as another recent breach of the US Treasury. In a statement about the news, Treasury alleges that Yin is affiliated with China\u2019s Ministry of State Security and has been a \u201ccyber actor\u201d for over a decade. It also imposed sanctions on Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a company that Treasury says is also associated with Salt Typhoon.\n\nSalt Typhoon\u2019s breach of US telecoms gave Chinese hackers enormous access to the real-time texts and phone calls of Americans, and was reportedly used to spy on president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance, among other targets. FBI director Christopher Wray has called the telecom breaches China\u2019s \"most significant cyberespionage campaign in history.\u201d\n\nAs the Treasury hits back at China\u2019s spy operations, it\u2019s also still working to determine the scope of the intrusion some of those same hackers carried out inside its network. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency\u2019s PCs and stolen more than 3,000 files in a recent breach. The espionage-focused intrusion appears to have gone after sanctions and law-enforcement related information, the report found, as well as other intelligence materials. Despite that vast access, the intruders didn\u2019t gain access to Treasury\u2019s emails or classified portions of its network, the report states, nor did they leave behind malware that would suggest an attempt at maintaining longer-term access.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed this week that the FBI carried out an operation to delete a specimen of malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers around the world. The malware, which was typically transmitted to computers via infected USB drives, has persisted for at least a decade and been used at times by Chinese state-sponsored hacker groups to target Chinese dissidents. In July of last year, cybersecurity firm Sekoia and French law enforcement took over the command-and-control server behind the malware. This week, the FBI obtained a court order that allowed the bureau to send a self-destruct command to the software on infected machines.\n\nAfter news earlier this week of a cyberattack in December that breached the US education technology platform PowerSchool, school districts targeted in the intrusion told TechCrunch on Thursday that attackers gained access to \u201call\u201d stored student and teacher data in their accounts. PowerSchool is used by more than 60 million K-12 students in the US. Hackers gained access to the information by stealing login credentials that gave them access to the company\u2019s customer support portal. The attack has not yet been publicly linked to a specific perpetrator. PowerSchool has not yet disclosed the exact number of victim schools nor whether all of its customers were affected.",

                "text": "As the United States scrambles to kick China out of its communications networks, Jessica Rosenworcel, the outgoing Democratic chair of the Federal Communications Commission, says it\u2019s vital for her Republican successor to maintain strong oversight of the telecommunications industry.\n\nThe government is still reeling from the Chinese \u201cSalt Typhoon\u201d hacking campaign that penetrated at least nine US telecom companies and gave Beijing access to Americans\u2019 phone calls and text messages and the wiretap systems used by law enforcement. The operation exploited US carriers\u2019 shockingly poor cybersecurity, including an AT&T administrator account that lacked basic security protections.\n\nTo prevent a repeat of the unprecedented telecom intrusion, Rosenworcel used the waning days of her FCC leadership to propose new cybersecurity requirements for telecom operators. On Thursday, the commission narrowly voted to approve her proposal. But those rules face a bleak future, with president-elect Donald Trump preparing to take office and control of the FCC transferring to commissioner Brendan Carr, a Trump ally who voted against Rosenworcel\u2019s regulatory plan.\n\nIn an interview days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Rosenworcel is adamant that regulation is part of the answer to America\u2019s telecom security crisis. And she has a stern message for Republicans who think the solution is to let the telecoms police themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are wrestling with what has been described as the worst telecommunications hack in our nation's history,\u201d she says. \u201cEither you take serious action or you don't.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Right Thing to Do\u201d\n\nRosenworcel\u2019s plan consists of two steps. First, the FCC formally declared that the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which required telecom companies to design their phone and internet systems to comply with wiretaps, also requires them to implement basic cyber defenses to prevent tampering. Next, the FCC proposed requiring a wider range of companies regulated by the commission to develop detailed cyber risk-management plans and annually attest to their implementation.\n\nThe outgoing chairwoman describes the rules as a commonsense response to a devastating attack.\n\n\u201cIn the United States in 2025, it would shock most consumers to know that our networks do not have minimum cybersecurity standards,\u201d Rosenworcel says. \u201cWe're asking the carriers to develop a plan and certify they follow that plan. That's the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nAbsent these standards, she adds, \u201cour networks are going to lack the protection they need from nation-state threats like this in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans are unlikely to embrace the new regulations on telecom networks. The powerful telecom industry tends to staunchly oppose any new regulations, and Republicans almost always side with the industry in these debates.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who now chairs the Commerce Committee, called Rosenworcel\u2019s plan \u201ca Band-Aid at best and a concealment of a serious blind spot at worst\u201d during a hearing in December.\n\nCarr\u2014who last month called Salt Typhoon \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d\u2014voted against Rosenworcel\u2019s proposal, along with his fellow Republican commissioner Nathan Simington. Carr\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the new regulations. But he has repeatedly criticized Rosenworcel\u2019s approach to enforcing rules on the telecom industry, accusing her of overreach and warning that the FCC must rein itself in or face pushback from courts.",

                "text": "The United States telecom giant AT&T disclosed a breach in July involving call and text messaging logs from six months in 2022 of \u201cnearly all\u201d its more than 100 million customers. In addition to exposing personal communication details for a slew of individual Americans, though, the FBI has been on alert that its agents\u2019 call and text records were also included in the breach. A document seen and first reported by Bloomberg indicates that the bureau has been scrambling to mitigate any potential fallout that could lead to revelations about the identities of anonymous sources connected to investigations.\n\nThe breached data didn't include the content of calls and texts, but Bloomberg reports that it would have shown communication logs for agents' mobile numbers and other phone numbers they used during the six months period. It is unclear how widely the stolen data has spread, if at all. WIRED reported in July that after the hackers attempted to extort AT&T, the company paid $370,000 in an attempt to have the data trove deleted. In December, US investigators charged and arrested a suspect who reportedly was behind the entity that threatened to leak the stolen data.\n\nThe FBI tells WIRED in a statement: \u201cThe FBI continually adapts our operational and security practices as physical and digital threats evolve. The FBI has a solemn responsibility to protect the identity and safety of confidential human sources, who provide information every day that keeps the American people safe, often at risk to themselves.\u201d\n\nAT&T spokesperson Alex Byers says in a statement that the company \u201cworked closely with law enforcement to mitigate impact to government operations\u201d and appreciates the \u201cthorough investigation\u201d they conducted. \u201cGiven the increasing threat from cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we continue to increase investments in security as well as monitor and remediate our networks,\u201d Byers adds.\n\nThe situation is surfacing amid ongoing revelations about a different hacking campaign perpetrated by China's Salt Typhoon espionage group, which compromised a slew of US telecoms, including AT&T. This separate situation exposed call and text logs for a smaller group of specific high-profile targets, and in some cases included recordings as well as information like location data.\n\nAs the US government has scrambled to respond, one recommendation from the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been for Americans to use end-to-end encrypted platforms\u2014like Signal or WhatsApp\u2014to communicate. Signal in particular stores almost no metadata about its customers and would not reveal which accounts have communicated with each other if it were breached. The suggestion was sound advice from a privacy perspective, but was very surprising given the US Justice Department's historic opposition to the use of end-to-end encryption. If the FBI has been grappling with the possibility that its own informants may have been exposed by a recent telecom breach, though, the about-face makes more sense.\n\nIf agents were following protocol for investigative communications strictly, though, the stolen AT&T call and text logs shouldn't pose a big threat, says former NSA hacker and Hunter Strategy vice president of research Jake Williams. Standard operating procedure should be designed to account for the possibility that call logs could be compromised, he says, and should require agents to communicate with sensitive sources using phone numbers that have never been linked to them or the US government. The FBI could be warning about the AT&T breach out of an abundance of caution, Williams says, or it may have discovered that agents' mistakes and protocol errors were captured in the stolen data. \u201cThis wouldn't be a counterintelligence issue unless someone was not following procedure,\u201d he says.\n\nWilliams adds, too, that while the Salt Typhoon campaigns are only known to have impacted a relatively small group of people, they affected many telecoms, and the full impact of those breaches still may not be known.\n\n\u201cI worry about the FBI sources who might have been affected by this AT&T exposure, but more broadly the public still doesn't have a full understanding of the fallout of the Salt Typhoon campaigns,\u201d Williams says. \u201cAnd it seems that the US government is still working on getting a grasp of that as well.\u201d",

                "text": "America\u2019s outgoing cyber ambassador has a warning for his successors in the incoming Trump administration: Stay engaged with tech and digital security debates on the world stage, because otherwise, Russia and China will fill the void.\n\n\u201cAn increasingly isolationist United States creates or amplifies a lot of problems that we're not going to be able to turn our backs on,\u201d says Nathaniel Fick, who has spent almost two and a half years as the US\u2019s first ambassador at large for cyberspace and digital policy. \u201cWe may not be interested in the world, but the world is interested in us.\u201d\n\nThe warning from Fick comes as foreign diplomats and cybersecurity experts nervously await indications of how Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, stocked with \u201cAmerica First\u201d conservatives, will handle issues such as foreign aid, digital security norms, and the tech competition with authoritarian nations.\n\nSpeaking to WIRED a few days before he\u2019s set to step down from his post\u2014one that still lacks a Trump nominee\u2014Fick says he\u2019s proud of the work that his relatively new State Department bureau has done and hopeful that Trump\u2019s team will see the value in building on that legacy.\n\nStaying in the Game\n\nThe Biden administration has spent years trying to convince \u201cmiddle ground\u201d countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to embrace the Western approach to technology and cybersecurity over China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s authoritarian visions. But it\u2019s an open question whether Trump\u2014who has disdained international institutions and insulted a host of foreign countries\u2014will continue this diplomatic campaign.\n\nTo Fick, the persuasion strategy is a no-brainer, because it\u2019s on the cusp of bearing real fruit. He\u2019s confident that more and more countries investing in cutting-edge technology like 5G wireless networks will ultimately pick Western vendors over Chinese businesses, for two big reasons: the privacy and security risks of hiring companies that are subservient to China\u2019s authoritarian regime and the lure of foreign direct investment (FDI) by Western governments looking for new supply chains free of untrustworthy electronics.\n\n\u201cEvery country in the world is competing for this FDI by big global technology businesses, or tech-enabled businesses, and countries are going to be able to carve out an advantaged position for themselves if they're using trusted technology,\u201d Fick says. \u201cI think that's an argument that this next team is going to be all over.\u201d\n\nOne of the strategic shifts that Fick oversaw involved knitting together US campaigns to promote Western 5G vendors and to spur the construction of new undersea internet cables. \u201cWe need to think about the full tech ecosystem,\u201d he says.\n\nTwo examples show the opportunities in this area. In Costa Rica, US support after devastating Russian cyberattacks helped convince San Jos\u00e9 to become a regional leader in promoting Western 5G technology, making it a hub of foreign supply-chain investment. And last month, the tiny South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu broke ground on its first undersea cable, financed by the US and Western allies. In Tuvalu, Fick says, \u201cwe preempted a generational buildout of fundamentally untrusted [Chinese] architecture.\u201d",

                "text": "In late November, a deepfake porn maker claiming to be based in the US uploaded a sexually explicit video to the world\u2019s largest site for pornographic deepfakes, featuring TikTok influencer Charli D\u2019Amelio\u2019s face superimposed onto a porn performer\u2019s body. Despite the influencer presumably playing no role in the video\u2019s production, it was viewed more than 8,200 times and captured the attention of other deepfake fans.\n\n\u201cSo nice! What program did you use for creating the deepfake??\u201d one user going by the name balascool commented. \u201cI love charli.\u201d D\u2019Amelio\u2019s agent did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe video\u2019s creator, \u201cDeepWorld23,\u201d has claimed in the comments that the program was a deepfake model hosted on developer platform GitHub. This program was \u201cstarred\u201d by 46,300 other users before being disabled in August 2024 after the platform introduced rules banning projects for synthetically creating nonconsensual sexual images, aka deepfake porn. It became available again in November 2024 in an archived format, where users can still access the code.\n\nGitHub\u2019s crackdown is incomplete, as the code\u2014along with others taken down by the developer site\u2014also persists in other repositories on the platform. A WIRED investigation has found more than a dozen GitHub projects linked to deepfake \u201cporn\u201d videos evading detection, extending access to code used for intimate image abuse and highlighting blind spots in the platform\u2019s moderation efforts. WIRED is not naming the projects or websites to avoid amplifying the abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to always remove something the moment it comes online,\u201d says Henry Ajder, an AI adviser to tech companies like Meta and Adobe on the challenge of moderating open source material online. \u201cAt the same time, there were red flags that were pretty clear.\u201d\n\nImplemented in June 2024, GitHub\u2019s policy bans projects that are \u201cdesigned for, encourage, promote, support, or suggest in any way the use of synthetic or manipulated media for the creation of nonconsensual intimate imagery or any content that would constitute misinformation or disinformation.\u201d\n\nGitHub has disabled at least three repositories identified by WIRED in December 2024 and is clearly taking action on abusive code. But others have popped up elsewhere on the platform, including some with near-identical branding or clear descriptors as \u201cNSFW,\u201d \u201cunlocked\u201d versions, or \u201cbypasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe condemn using GitHub to post sexually obscene content and prohibit such conduct in our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies,\u201c says Jesse Geraci, online safety counsel at GitHub. \u201cGitHub conducts proactive screening for such content, in addition to actively investigating abuse reports, and we quickly take action where content violates our terms.\u201d\n\nOne project identified by WIRED in December 2024 had branding almost identical to a major project\u2014self-described as the \u201cleading software for creating deepfakes\u201d\u2014which GitHub disabled for several months last year for violating its terms of service. GitHub has also since disabled this additional version.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hiding,\u201d says Ajder. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t particularly subtle.\u201d\n\nHowever, an archived version of the major repository is still available, and at least six other repositories based on the model were present on GitHub as of January 10, including another branded almost identically.",

                "text": "Four days before he leaves office, US president Joe Biden has issued a sweeping cybersecurity directive ordering improvements to the way the government monitors its networks, buys software, uses artificial intelligence, and punishes foreign hackers.\n\nThe 40-page executive order unveiled on Thursday is the Biden White House\u2019s final attempt to kickstart efforts to harness the security benefits of AI, roll out digital identities for US citizens, and close gaps that have helped China, Russia, and other adversaries repeatedly penetrate US government systems.\n\nThe order \u201cis designed to strengthen America\u2019s digital foundations and also put the new administration and the country on a path to continued success,\u201d Anne Neuberger, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nLooming over Biden\u2019s directive is the question of whether president-elect Donald Trump will continue any of these initiatives after he takes the oath of office on Monday. None of the highly technical projects decreed in the order are partisan, but Trump\u2019s advisers may prefer different approaches (or timetables) to solving the problems that the order identifies.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t named any of his top cyber officials, and Neuberger said the White House didn\u2019t discuss the order with his transition staff, \u201cbut we are very happy to, as soon as the incoming cyber team is named, have any discussions during this final transition period.\u201d\n\nThe core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents\u2014namely, the security failures of federal contractors.\n\nThe order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on a mandate that debuted in 2022 in response to Biden\u2019s first cyber executive order. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would be tasked with double-checking these security attestations and working with vendors to fix any problems. To put some teeth behind the requirement, the White House\u2019s Office of the National Cyber Director is \u201cencouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General\u201d for potential investigation and prosecution.\n\nThe order gives the Department of Commerce eight months to assess the most commonly used cyber practices in the business community and issue guidance based on them. Shortly thereafter, those practices would become mandatory for companies seeking to do business with the government. The directive also kicks off updates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s secure software development guidance.\n\nAnother part of the directive focuses on the protection of cloud platforms\u2019 authentication keys, the compromise of which opened the door for China\u2019s theft of government emails from Microsoft\u2019s servers and its recent supply-chain hack of the Treasury Department. Commerce and the General Services Administration have 270 days to develop guidelines for key protection, which would then have to become requirements for cloud vendors within 60 days.\n\nTo protect federal agencies from attacks that rely on flaws in internet-of-things gadgets, the order sets a January 4, 2027, deadline for agencies to purchase only consumer IoT devices that carry the newly launched US Cyber Trust Mark label.",

                "text": "The scam ecosystem has been booming around the world, with criminals honing a handful of strategies to trick victims into voluntarily sending their money into the abyss. And as the cash\u2014or, typically, cryptocurrency\u2014flows in, a set of digital services and infrastructure offerings have increasingly emerged. The scam economy helps criminals with everything from creating fake social media pages to buying SIM cards\u2014and, crucially, with money laundering. Now, researchers say that in the pantheon of dark web marketplaces, the \u201clargest illicit online marketplace\u201d ever is now one that sells services to other scammers rather than focusing on drugs or other contraband.\n\nNew findings from the crypto-tracing firm Elliptic show how one of the biggest players in that sphere, Huione Guarantee, has likely enabled $24 billion in gray market transactions\u2014with the volume of activity on the platform rocketing up 51 percent since initial investigations last summer. At the same time, the platform is offering more services than ever, including launching its own messaging app, stablecoin, and cryptocurrency exchange. Expanding the empire means more profits for administrators, but it may also be part of an effort to, according to Elliptic, flood the zone and protect Huione Guarantee from potential law enforcement action or technological crackdowns.\n\n\u201cWhat platforms really do is help scammers to scale up their operations, and it\u2019s really enabled the industrialization of online scams,\u201d says Tom Robinson, Elliptic\u2019s cofounder and chief scientist. \u201cHuione Guarantee is a key node in this network of facilitators of online scams. Preventing it from operating would have a significant impact on online scams and would have an immediate beneficial effect on victims and potential victims.\u201d\n\nA Chinese-language platform that has wider links to businesses associated with the Cambodian ruling family, Huione Guarantee first emerged in 2021 as investment scams\u2014or so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams\u2014from Southeast Asia boomed. One of the platform\u2019s centerpiece features is a deposit and escrow service, connecting buyers and sellers to help facilitate their transactions. But the service also acts as a general store that fulfills every scammer\u2019s needs, with sellers hawking victim contact details, deepfake tools to trick targets, fake investment websites, and more.\n\nHuione Guarantee mostly operates through the social media app Telegram, organized around groups and bots that have tens of thousands of members and followers. Transactions typically take place using the Tether stablecoin. Telegram did not return WIRED\u2019s request for comment about Huione Guarantee\u2019s activity and growth on its platform. Tether also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHuione Guarantee itself did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. However, last year, following the publication of Elliptic\u2019s previous research, Huione Guarantee posted a statement to its website where it claimed to be an \u201cinformation publishing and guarantee trading platform,\u201d and the services \u201care provided by third-party merchants and we only provide guarantee services.\u201d The company also said that after it saw Elliptic\u2019s previous report, it removed some sellers.",

                "text": "A device capable of intercepting phone signals was likely deployed during the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, WIRED has learned, raising critical questions about who authorized its use and for what purpose.\n\nThe device, known as a cell-site simulator, was identified by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights advocacy organization, after analyzing wireless signal data collected by WIRED during the August event.\n\nCell-site simulators mimic cell towers to intercept communications, indiscriminately collecting sensitive data such as call metadata, location information, and app traffic from all phones within their range. Their use has drawn widespread criticism from privacy advocates and activists, who argue that such technology can be exploited to covertly monitor protesters and suppress dissent.\n\nThe DNC convened amid widespread protests over Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza. While credentialed influencers attended exclusive yacht parties and VIP events, thousands of demonstrators faced a heavy law enforcement presence, including officers from the US Capitol Police, the Secret Service, Homeland Security Investigations, local sheriff\u2019s offices, and Chicago police.\n\nConcerns over potential surveillance prompted WIRED to conduct a first-of-its-kind wireless survey to investigate whether cell-site simulators were being deployed. Reporters, equipped with two rooted Android phones and Wi-Fi hot spots running detection software, used Rayhunter\u2014a tool developed by the EFF to detect data anomalies associated with these devices. WIRED\u2019s reporters monitored signals at protests and event locations across Chicago, collecting extensive data during the political convention.\n\nInitial tests conducted during the DNC revealed no conclusive evidence of cell-site simulator activity. However, months later, EFF technologists reanalyzed the raw data using improved detection methods. According to Cooper Quintin, a senior technologist at the EFF, the Rayhunter tool stores all interactions between devices and cell towers, allowing for deeper analysis as detection techniques evolve.\n\nA breakthrough came when EFF technologists applied a new heuristic to examine situations where cell towers requested IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) numbers from devices. According to the EFF\u2019s analysis, on August 18\u2014the day before the convention officially began\u2014a device carried by WIRED reporters en route a hotel housing Democratic delegates from states in the US Midwest abruptly switched to a new tower. That tower asked for the device\u2019s IMSI and then immediately disconnected\u2014a sequence consistent with the operation of a cell-site simulator.\n\n\u201cThis is extremely suspicious behavior that normal towers do not exhibit,\u201d Quintin says. He notes that the EFF typically observed similar patterns only during simulated and controlled attacks. \u201cThis is not 100 percent incontrovertible truth, but it\u2019s strong evidence suggesting a cell-site simulator was deployed. We don\u2019t know who was responsible\u2014it could have been the US government, foreign actors, or another entity.\u201d\n\nUnder Illinois law, law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant to deploy cell-site simulators. Similarly, federal agents\u2014including those from the Department of Homeland Security\u2014are required to secure warrants unless an immediate national security threat exists. However, a 2023 DHS Inspector General report found that both the Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations did not always comply with these requirements.",

                "text": "Some of the world\u2019s most popular apps are likely being co-opted by rogue members of the advertising industry to harvest sensitive location data on a massive scale, with that data ending up with a location data company whose subsidiary has previously sold global location data to US law enforcement.\n\nThe thousands of apps, included in hacked files from location data company Gravy Analytics, include everything from games like Candy Crush and dating apps like Tinder to pregnancy tracking and religious prayer apps across both Android and iOS. Because much of the collection is occurring through the advertising ecosystem\u2014not code developed by the app creators themselves\u2014this data collection is likely happening without users\u2019 or even app developers\u2019 knowledge.\n\nThis article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.\n\n\u201cFor the first time publicly, we seem to have proof that one of the largest data brokers selling to both commercial and government clients appears to be acquiring their data from the online advertising \u2018bid stream,\u2019\u201d rather than code embedded into the apps themselves, Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push and who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.\n\nThe data provides a rare glimpse inside the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data firms paid app developers to include bundles of code that collected the location data of their users. Many companies have turned instead to sourcing location information through the advertising ecosystem, where companies bid to place ads inside apps. But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and harvest the location of peoples\u2019 mobile phones.\n\n\u201cThis is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data scraped from the RTB systems, but there's some company out there acting like a global honey badger, doing whatever it pleases with every piece of data that comes its way,\u201d Edwards says.\n\nIncluded in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates of devices inside the US, Russia, and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each piece of location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and built a list of mentioned apps.\n\nThe list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games such as Candy Crush, Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells; transit app Moovit; My Period Calendar & Tracker, a period-tracking app with more than 10 million downloads; popular fitness app MyFitnessPal; social network Tumblr; Yahoo\u2019s email client; Microsoft\u2019s 365 office app; and flight tracker Flightradar24. The list also mentions multiple religious-focused apps such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, various pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.\n\nThe full list can be found here. Multiple security researchers have published other lists of apps included in the data, of varying sizes. Our version is relatively larger because it includes both Android and iOS apps, and we decided to keep duplicate instances of the same app that had slight name variations to make it easier for readers to search for apps they have installed.\n\nAlthough this dataset came from an apparent hack of Gravy, it is not clear whether Gravy collected this location data itself or sourced it from another company, or which location company ultimately owns it or is licensed to use it.",

                "text": "Over the past decade, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton has wielded his office\u2019s significant resources to investigate well-known tech giants including Google and Meta over how they moderate content and treat rivals. He helped win settlements against Apple for allegedly misleading users and is suing TikTok for allegedly endangering children's privacy. Now, Paxton\u2019s latest tech investigation includes an expansive number of targets, WIRED has learned.\n\nRumble, Quora, and WeChat are among the 15 companies from which Texas has demanded answers by next week about their collection and use of data of people under 18 years old. Paxton announced the investigation in a press release last month but named only four of the companies being probed\u2014Character.AI, Red\u00addit, Insta\u00adgram, and Dis\u00adcord. WIRED obtained the names of additional targeted companies through a public records request. They also include Kick, Kik, Pinterest, Telegram, Twitch, Tumblr, WhatsApp, and Whisper.\n\nPaxton\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment, including about how it chose which businesses to investigate. But the variety of companies questioned highlights the sprawling reach of a new Texas law aimed at increasing oversight of minors\u2019 use of social media and chat services.\n\nThree experts in youth privacy regulations who have been following Paxton\u2019s enforcement efforts say the new investigation should be treated credibly, and they believe it could result in companies agreeing to improve their practices. The alternative could be up to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties per company. \u201cWhen you bring all the statutes together, Texas has a pretty significant hammer,\u201d says Paul Singer, a partner and section chair at the law firm Kelley Drye & Warren.\n\nSpokespeople for Character.AI and Tumblr say they take safety issues seriously. Meta and WeChat declined to comment. Other companies under investigation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPaxton launched his probe three days after the families of an 11-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy in Texas sued chatbot startup Character.AI, claiming the company designed its product in an unsafe way that exposed the kids to sexualized and violent responses. In October, a similar case was filed in Florida by the family of a 14-year-old who shot himself to death allegedly following conversations with a Character.AI chatbot. Character.AI later introduced an experience aimed at kids and plans to roll out parental controls.\n\nOther services under investigation including Kik, Instagram, and Discord have faced public scrutiny over their use by children. But less so WeChat, a messaging app popular among Chinese Americans, and Quora, a forum for crowdsourcing information that\u2019s recently expanded into AI chatbots.\n\nPaxton\u2019s interest in Rumble, a YouTube-like website popular among US conservative political commentators, is also perhaps unexpected given his track record of partisan views about social media companies. Rumble has touted itself as a haven for free expression, unlike platforms that engage in allegedly heavier content moderation. Paxton is a Republican and has criticized platforms that unfairly silence Texans.",

                "text": "TikTok\u2019s day of reckoning in the US has arrived. On Friday, the United States Supreme Court will hear the company\u2019s appeal against its slated nationwide ban, which could come into force in a little more than a week if the company\u2019s efforts fail.\n\nThe social video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance and is used by around 170 million Americans, has been appealing the ban since US president Joe Biden signed the law underpinning it last year. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) states that ByteDance must sell TikTok\u2019s US business to a non-Chinese company by January 19\u2014no buyer has yet been found\u2014or see the app blocked in the US. Donald Trump, who retakes the White House on January 20, publicly originated the idea that ByteDance be forced to sell TikTok during his first presidential term but has since reversed course.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which is hearing the case quickly due to the impending deadline and following a federal court upholding the ban in December, will determine whether the US Constitution\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech is overruled by the government\u2019s belief that TikTok is a threat to US national security. Proponents of PAFACA claim TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership could allow China to steal data on Americans and spread disinformation\u2014although little evidence has been presented to support those claims, which the company denies.\n\nIf the court allows the ban to go ahead\u2014and Trump doesn\u2019t find a way to stop it\u2014the move will be an unprecedented technological clampdown in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a national-level ban that appears imminent in the United States,\u201d says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist at the Internet Society. TikTok has been banned or faces lawsuits in other countries, such as India, and the pressures come against the backdrop of total internet shutdowns and increased online censorship. \u201cWhat we learned from all of those is that this ends up really hurting the people of the country, that the economic effects are immediate for people,\u201d Hall says.\n\nSo, how would TikTok actually be banned?\n\nApp Stores, Hosting Providers\n\nUnpicking TikTok from the nation\u2019s consciousness\u2014thousands of influencers and businesses use the app to make money and promote themselves\u2014is not exactly straightforward. Nor is it simple to untangle the company from US-based internet infrastructure.\n\nPAFACA doesn\u2019t require anyone to uninstall TikTok from their phones. It also doesn\u2019t say TikTok should directly stop its services from working in the US. Instead, it effectively tries to throttle TikTok by making it harder to use over time and by stopping companies from providing services that help it to keep working and quickly loading videos.\n\nTikTok, as with all companies mentioned in this story, did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment and hasn\u2019t, at this stage, outlined what technical steps it will or will not take if the ban does eventually come into place.",

                "text": "In a May interview with WIRED, Torswats admitted that he made his hoax calls partly for fame and partly for political reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s taking money that would normally be used for welfare checks to Jews and to bankers and to oligarchs,\u201d he said in his drawl, \u201cand it\u2019s being spent on searching schools.\u201d\n\nDennis, for his part, has settled on a simpler theory to explain Torswats\u2019 behavior\u2014and the entire scourge of swatting as a means to blindly terrorize strangers. He defaults to the same principle he used to explain why Dshocker swatted him nearly two decades earlier.\n\n\u201cPower,\u201d Dennis says. \u201cBecause they can.\u201d\n\nIn November, just weeks after his 18th birthday, Filion pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his nationwide spree of swatting calls. He faces up to 20 years in prison for four counts of making interstate threats to injure another person. As of mid-December, the teenager is awaiting sentencing in a Seminole County, Florida, jail cell.\n\nDennis remains in a different form of purgatory. On a recent night, when a WIRED reporter visited him, he went through his usual routine: he ate breakfast, checked his email for leads on work, played the video game Rocket League, and idled aimlessly around his apartment. Throughout the evening, he carried a loaded glock in a holster, a round in the chamber, no safety. He drinks Red Bulls every two hours, exactly, now timed with alarms on his phone, to space out his caffeine intake. He no longer gets visits from the squirrels. He can\u2019t be sure, but he believes that his favorites\u2014Jackie, Jesse, Alvin, Doug\u2014have died of old age or been killed by other animals. Dennis doesn\u2019t have it in him to befriend new ones.\n\nOn one of his nighttime drives through Seattle\u2019s skid rows, he recently spotted an 11-year-old girl near a Krispy Kreme. He recognized her from a poster of missing and exploited children. She approached his car thinking he might be a customer; he then helped local police to find her and reconnect her with a foster family. He\u2019s proud of that, just as he\u2019s proud of having cracked the Torswats case. But he has received little recognition for either, from police agencies or the FBI. His paid work as a private eye has largely evaporated. To stay afloat, he has sold off possessions\u2014including the very computer he used to find Torswats\u2014and for a time took up driving for Uber Eats. \u201cIt\u2019s been the worst year I\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the meantime, Dennis has watched in dismay as swattings\u2014and school swattings in particular\u2014have continued to spread across the US. There\u2019s been no new Torswats, no single, prominent villain who single-handedly represents the threat. But nor has there been a shortage of new nihilist trolls willing to pick up where Torswats left off.\n\nDennis has no faith any of that will change. The US remains a country awash in guns, where the prospect of a mass shooting has become a pervasive, looming menace. And American police remain a hair-trigger, militarized force ready to be exploited by anyone with modest technical skills and a convincing voice.\n\nIf Dennis is hopeful about anything, it\u2019s that another high-profile case will come his way, one that will give him the same sense of purpose he felt during the Torswats investigation. As he drives around in the dark, he seems to hope that another monster will appear for him to hunt\u2014that it might offer him a chance to repair his career and some part of the world.\n\n\u201cThings will happen that will change the course of your life,\u201d he says from the driver\u2019s seat of his Honda as he peers out of the windshield at the North Seattle streets. \u201cThings will reveal themselves.\u201d\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.

                "text": "In just 20 minutes this morning, an automated license-plate-recognition (ALPR) system with an IP address geolocated to Tennessee captured photographs and detailed information from nearly 1,000 vehicles as they passed by. Among them: eight black Jeep Wranglers, six Honda Accords, an ambulance, and a yellow Ford Fiesta with a vanity plate.\n\nThis trove of real-time vehicle data, collected by one of Motorola\u2019s ALPR systems, is meant to be accessible by law enforcement. However, a flaw discovered by a security researcher has exposed live video feeds and detailed records of passing vehicles, revealing the staggering scale of surveillance enabled by this widespread technology.\n\nMore than 150 Motorola ALPR cameras have exposed their video feeds and leaking data in recent months, according to security researcher Matt Brown, who first publicized the issues in a series of YouTube videos after buying an ALPR camera on eBay and reverse engineering it.\n\nAs well as broadcasting live footage accessible to anyone on the internet, the misconfigured cameras also exposed data they have collected, including photos of cars and logs of license plates. The real-time video and data feeds don\u2019t require any usernames or passwords to access.\n\nAlongside other technologists, WIRED has reviewed video feeds from several of the cameras, confirming vehicle data\u2014including makes, models, and colors of cars\u2014have been accidentally exposed. Motorola confirmed the exposures, telling WIRED it was working with its customers to close the access.\n\nOver the last decade, thousands of ALPR cameras have appeared in towns and cities across the US. The cameras, which are manufactured by companies such as Motorola and Flock Safety, automatically take pictures when they detect a car passing by. The cameras and databases of collected data are frequently used by police to search for suspects. ALPR cameras can be placed along roads, on the dashboards of cop cars, and even in trucks. These cameras capture billions of photos of cars\u2014including occasionally bumper stickers, lawn signs, and T-shirts.\n\n\u201cEvery one of them that I found exposed was in a fixed location over some roadway,\u201d Brown, who runs cybersecurity company Brown Fine Security, tells WIRED. The exposed video feeds each cover a single lane of traffic, with cars driving through the camera\u2019s view. In some streams, snow is falling. Brown found two streams for each exposed camera system, one in color and another in infrared.\n\nBroadly, when a car passes an ALPR camera, a photograph of the vehicle is taken, and the system uses machine learning to extract text from the license plate. This is stored alongside details such as where the photograph was taken, the time, as well as metadata such as the make and model of the vehicle.\n\nBrown says the camera feeds and vehicle data were likely exposed as they had not been set up on private networks, possibly by law enforcement bodies deploying them, and instead exposed to the internet without any authentication. \u201cIt\u2019s been misconfigured. It shouldn\u2019t be open on the public internet,\u201d he says.\n\nWIRED tested the flaw by analyzing data streams from 37 different IP addresses apparently tied to Motorola cameras, spanning more than a dozen cities across the United States, from Omaha, Nebraska, to New York City. Within just 20 minutes, those cameras recorded the make, model, color, and license plates of nearly 4,000 vehicles. Some cars were even captured multiple times\u2014up to three times in some cases\u2014as they passed different cameras.",

                "text": "Gabriele Marcotti believes Arsenal's titles hopes are very dependent on keeping Kai Havertz fit for the rest of the season. (2:26)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nMikel Arteta has described Kai Havertz as a genetic \"powerhouse\" and backed the Germany international to compensate for Arsenal's failure to sign a forward in January.\n\nThe Gunners made no secret of their desire add an attacking player in the midseason window following injuries to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus but were unsuccessful after having a \u00a340 million ($49.9m) bid rejected by Aston Villa for Ollie Watkins.\n\nJesus is set to be sidelined for the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery while Saka is not expected back until next month at the earliest, putting more focus on Havertz to play a key role as Arsenal challenge on three fronts.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's Carabao Cup semifinal second leg against Newcastle, Arteta backed Havertz -- a \u00a365m signing from Chelsea in 2023 -- to handle the workload, which could theoretically mean starting every game for the rest of the season.\n\nKai Havertz scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season in Arsenal's 5-1 drubbing of Manchester City on Sunday. David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\n\"I don't know ... it is a possibility [he could start every game],\" Arteta said. \"Maybe we go through that scenario and he scores another 15 or 18 goals? Can you imagine? That's a good scenario.\n\n\"Genetically, he is a powerhouse. He is so well-built. He is a player that anything you ask him, he is happy to do: to run in zone six, to be very robust, to make long distances. His body absorbs everything. And then he really looks after himself.\n\n\"When you see the professional, how he lives his life, it is immaculate. He does more than any other player there. That is not a coincidence. And then I think he is so intelligent.\n\n\"He knows what is good for him and what is not. We know how to manage him and we believe that when he says something it is for the right reason, not because he wants to avoid something. When something works, don't touch him.\"\n\nHavertz has scored 15 goals and registered five assists in 33 games this season but has faced criticism for a series of bad misses, particularly during the period when Arsenal won just once in five games last month, including a 2-0 first-leg defeat to Newcastle.\n\n\"He has played a lot of football but his robustness, his availability is unbelievable,\" Arteta continued.\n\n\"When you ask him he feels better when he is playing every three days. Against Girona for example, we gave him a rest. And then he felt fresher.\n\n\"He then had a very demanding game physically against Manchester City for the role that he had to do. We will see how they are. Players give you a lot of information but if you are playing well and scoring goals, all this helps.\"\n\nArteta also claimed Arsenal will soon appoint a permanent sporting director to replace Edu, who resigned in November and is set to take up a prominent role leading the multi-club model spearheaded by Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis after completing six months of gardening leave.\n\nSources have told ESPN that the Gunners have now identified a shortlist of candidates to consider alongside interim sporting director Jason Ayto, who stepped up following Edu's exit.\n\n\"The decision I think will be done relatively quickly, whether it's Jason or somebody else I don't know but I think that decision will be done quite early,\" Arteta added.",

                "text": "Julien Laurens looks at new Manchester City midfielder Nico Gonz\u00e1lez and explains why Pep Guardiola needed him a month ago. (1:25)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Premier League has said \"significant progress\" has been made with testing of semi-automated VAR offside technology (SAOT) in recent weeks, adding that it still plans to introduce the new system this season.\n\nIt's almost a year since clubs unanimously voted to bring in the technology, which is intended to reduce the time taken for an offside check by an average of 31 seconds.\n\nThe system was not ready at the start of the season, but it was supposed to be brought in \"after one of the Autumn international breaks.\"\n\nHowever, no information was forthcoming on the progress of testing, and as the calendar crossed into 2025 it seemed as though SAOT would not arrive in the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nExtensive testing and analysis was conducted throughout last season but the Premier League is not yet confident the technology is fully reliable and won't use it live until it is.\n\n\"We are still testing it, but we are making significant progress,\" Tony Scholes, the Premier League's chief football officer, revealed on Tuesday. \"We're in a different place to when I spoke to managers just over Christmas, we've made a lot of progress in this area.\n\n\"Now I'm hopeful that at some point this season we will be able to introduce semi-automated technology but I repeat the points I've made a number of times. We are not going to introduce it if we've got any doubts at all with regards to its operation.\"\n\nSAOT removes the manual element of placing the lines onto players and to pitch level, making it quicker and more accurate. SAOT also provides a much-improved graphical visualisation of an offside decision, rather than the existing method of displaying lines on the broadcast camera.\n\nFIFA and UEFA have used an enhanced system in the World Cup and the UEFA Champions League, which sees a chip inside the ball for better detection of when the ball has been touched. However, Adidas owns the patent for that system, and none of the major European leagues use the company as ball supplier.\n\nSerie A was the first European domestic league to switch to SAOT, introducing it in January 2023 after a high-profile VAR error early in that campaign had seen a stoppage-time winning goal for Juventus incorrectly disallowed.\n\nSAOT provides a much-improved graphical visualisation of an offside decision. FIFA\n\nLaLiga became the second top European league to move over to SAOT at the start of this season, though its accuracy has been called into doubt several times including when Robert Lewandowski had a goal disallowed for Barcelona against Real Sociedad.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Premier League developing its own SAOT, when other leagues have already introduced it.\n\n\"The system that we've adopted, we believe it to be the best system,\" Scholes added. \"We believe it to be the most accurate and the most futureproof system as well and that's why we went with that.\n\n\"I have to confess, given the difficulties that we had over the first few months of the season, I had severe doubts about this, but the progress made over the last four to six weeks has been significant.\n\n\"We believe we're going to be adopting the best system and the most accurate system without the need for the chip in the ball.\"\n\nScholes also defended the prospect of switching from the legacy VAR offside technology to SAOT when the majority of the season will have been played.\n\n\"It's a very fair question and we've sort of questioned ourselves about this,\" Scholes admitted. \"But fundamentally, the operation of semi-automated offside technology does not change the integrity of the offside law and doesn't change the integrity of the decision making.\n\n\"What it does is makes the process more efficient. So if we hold true to that basis that we're not actually changing the integrity of it, we're just making it more efficient, you arrive at a place that says, well, why wouldn't you introduce it when you're absolutely confident it's ready.\n\n\"Clearly if we're not confident until the last two or three match rounds, I think you then arrive at a pragmatic place where you just say it wouldn't make sense to introduce it now. But if we're able to introduce it in advance of that, then it's something that we are actively considering.\"\n\nVAR mistakes after 23 rounds Interv.

The statistics produced by the Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) Panel revealed that the number of errors after 23 games had fallen from 20 last season to 13 in the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nHe added that the Elite Referee Development Plan, which aims to fast-track promising referees through the level, is already producing results.\n\n\"These are referees whose potential has been identified and plucked out from whatever level they're operating in the game,\" Scholes explained. \"We're investing in them to shorten the time it takes them to get to the league. Sixty-five games have been officiated by officials in the development group already this season at a level higher than they operate.\n\n\"Two years ago, Sam Barrott was a League One and League Two referee. He's now on the FIFA list. And then there's Lewis Smith, who's refereed four Premier League games. Two years ago, Lewis was refereeing Premier League Two [academy teams] and National League games. So PGMOL deserved great credit for the work that they are doing in shortening the amount of time it takes for these officials to come through to be able to officiate in the Premier league.\"\n\nScholes also revealed that the Premier League intends to introduce referees announcing VAR decisions to the crowd, which has been tested in the Carabao Cup semifinals, at the start of next season. The Bundesliga became the first major European league to trial it, starting with select fixtures last weekend.\n\nScholes added that he wants fans inside the stadium to have \"at least an equal experience as to those at home\" when it comes to VAR, and the league's position is \"to get to a place where we have full visibility and full audio of the conversation between the referee and the VAR.\"\n\nThe Premier League will continue to lobby for change with the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which controls VAR protocol.\n\nAll 13 VAR errors in the Premier League this season\n\nIncorrect interventions (4)\n\n1.

(2:04)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nManchester United are hoping their conservative approach to the January transfer window will allow them to complete a major rebuild of the playing squad in the summer, a source has told ESPN.\n\nUnited signed left-back Patrick Dorgu from Lecce and youngster Ayden Heaven from Arsenal in January while allowing Marcus Rashford and Antony to leave on loan. Tyrell Malacia is also expected to seal a temporary move to PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday.\n\nThere has been criticism from supporters over the club's reluctance to sign another attacking player despite a desperate lack of goals.\n\nStrikers Rasmus H\u00f8jlund and Joshua Zirkzee have scored just five Premier League goals between them so far this season.\n\nA source has told ESPN that United looked at various options to bolster Ruben Amorim's attacking options, including Mathys Tel.\n\nMan United have struggled for form since Ruben Amorim's arrival, but the club opted to stay conservative in the January transfer window. Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\n\nHowever, there was concern internally that any money spent would have reduced their budget for the summer window when it was more likely that players who better fit their long-term plans will be available.\n\nUnited, according to an ESPN source, ended their interest in Tel because of Bayern Munich's demand for a loan fee of around \u00a35 million ($6.2m) with no option or obligation to make the move permanent built into the deal.\n\nThe feeling was that they were being asked to provide game time to a young player to aid his development for the benefit of Bayern.\n\nUnited's financial position is being described by insiders as \"very tight\" but there is hope that their approach to the January window will aid prospects of a substantial overhaul in the summer.\n\nVictor Lindel\u00f6f and Christian Eriksen, both out of contract at the end of the season, are expected to leave on free transfers. United will also attempt to remove Casemiro's large salary from their wage bill with a permanent move.\n\nA source has told ESPN that Sporting CP's Geovany Quenda is one of the summer targets. The 17-year-old has a release clause of \u20ac100m ($103m) but there is a belief that Amorim's former club will be willing to negotiate a fee closer to \u20ac60m.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMikel Arteta has admitted his disappointment at Arsenal's failure to sign a striker in the January transfer window but believes the club need to stay \"very disciplined\" to remain on track.\n\nThe Gunners had an offer in the region of \u00a340 million ($50m) for Ollie Watkins rejected by Aston Villa last week and despite Arteta publicly declaring their need for attacking reinforcements following injuries to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus, the club was unable to bring anyone in.\n\nArteta said: \"We had a clear intention which is obvious. There is a window open to explore the possibilities to improve our squad with players that can impact it. We haven't achieved it.\n\n\"So we are disappointed in that sense but as well we are very aware that we only want to bring certain kind of players. We have to be very disciplined with that as well and I think we were.\n\n\"I wouldn't like to go into too much detail. We couldn't do it for certain reasons and we have to accept it, that's it. It was a combination of things.\"\n\nMikel Arteta hoped to make a signing in January but Arsenal couldn't find the right deal. Visionhaus/Getty Images\n\nPushed to explain how that show of discipline could impact Arsenal's summer plans -- when longer-term targets including Red Bull Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Newcastle's Alexander Isak could be available -- Arteta replied: \"What I mean about that is in everything, in the kind of profile, in the kind of player that we believe can really make us much better.\n\n\"Financially. In a lot of ways, there are a lot of things that we must stay in the lane that has taken us this far and from there, try to improve.\"\n\nArteta suggested last week that Arsenal's decision not to sign a striker last summer left them \"short\" in terms of numbers and when asked how much of a gamble it was in that context not to add to his squad mid-season, the Spaniard said: \"It is not a gamble, it is reality. We have to face the reality as well that we have. We have the players that we have.\n\n\"Some of them are on loan. We have never had a squad of 35, 40, 45 players. So many other clubs they have 45 players on the list. We don't have that size at the moment. It is our reality.\n\n\"We have had to do so much in the last few years that's where we are so we will have to evolve there as well and have more, more players from the academy and the ones that are here to be fitter for longer. That is a job that is permanent and it keeps evolving. We need to be on our toes.\"\n\nArsenal travel to Newcastle on Wednesday for their Carabao Cup semifinal, second-leg clash aiming to overturn a 2-0 deficit from the first leg.",

Photo by HENRY NICHOLLS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn his first statement to the CPS, the officer made no mention of the \"stupid and white\" comment having an impact on him, the jury was told.\n\nPolice submitted a request to review the CPS decision not to prosecute, and it responded that the outcome would be limited to an apology, the court heard.\n\nProsecutors later requested further evidence, and a second statement from Lovell was provided in December 2023 mentioning the alleged impact.\n\nHe read a section of the statement to the court which said the comments made him \"shocked, upset, and [left] me feeling humiliated.\"\n\nThe charge was authorised later in December 2023, nearly a year after the incident.\n\nGrace Forbes, defending Kerr, said during cross-examination: \"The only reason you made that statement was because the Crown Prosecution Service had declined to authorise a criminal charge to prosecute Ms Kerr.\"\n\nHe responded \"no\" before agreeing that officers were dealing with whether to pursue prosecution in August 2023.\n\n\"Throughout July and August 2023, the Women's World Cup was playing,\" the defense lawyer said.\n\nLovell responded: \"If you say so, yes.\"\n\nForbes said \"Ms Kerr was playing for her country\" and \"she would have been all over TV -- do you recall seeing her?\"\n\nThe officer denied seeing the striker on TV before the defense barrister said \"this person who made you feel unimportant.\"\n\nShe added: \"You were determined to pursue this person, weren't you?\"\n\nLovell said \"yes\" and Forbes asked \"through the criminal courts?\"\n\nThe officer said \"yes\" again.\n\nDuring re-examination by prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones, Lovell told the jury that being called \"stupid\" had made him feel \"belittled and upset.\"\n\nJones asked if his race had \"any relevance as far as you can see to what was going on,\" and Lovell said \"no\" and later added that the reference to him being white \"upset me, I guess.\"\n\nThe prosecutor asked: \"Is that correct, Pc Lovell, that you just made something up to get a charge over the line?\" He replied: \"No, I didn't make it up to get a charge over the line.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

(0:34)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nCristiano Ronaldo said he is \"the most complete player to have existed,\" saying he respects fans who prefer Lionel Messi, Pel\u00e9 or Diego Maradona, but arguing that statistics back up his claim.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner, 39, has broken a host of records during his career and is the highest men's goal scorer in football history with 923 goals, the latest coming in a brace in Al Nassr's 4-0 AFC Champions League win over Al Wasl on Monday.\n\n\"Who's the best goal scorer in history? It's about numbers. Full stop,\" Ronaldo told Spanish television show El Chiringuito in an extensive interview on Monday.\n\n\"Who's the player in history who's scored most goals with their head, their left foot, penalties, free kicks? I was looking the other day, and not being left-footed, I'm in the top 10 goal scorers with their left foot in history. And with my head, and with my right foot, and penalties. All of them.\"\n\nRonaldo has faced constant comparisons with Messi throughout his career, as both battled to be recognised as the best player on the planet.\n\n\"I'm talking about numbers,\" Ronaldo said. \"I think I'm the most complete player to have existed. In my opinion, I think it's me. I do everything well in football: with my head, free kicks, left foot. I'm fast, I'm strong.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in a 4-0 win for Al Nassr on Tuesday. Al Nassr FC/Al Nassr FC via Getty Image\n\n\"One thing is taste -- if you like Messi, Pel\u00e9, Maradona, I understand that and I respect that -- but saying Ronaldo isn't complete... I'm the most complete. I haven't seen anybody better than me, and I say it from the heart.\"\n\nAt 39, Ronaldo still isn't contemplating retirement from club or international football.\n\n\"I'm so competitive that sometimes I forget what I've achieved,\" he said, \"Because it gives me motivation to do more and do better every year ... I think that's the difference with others. Somebody else in my position would have left football 10 years ago. I'm different, full stop.\"\n\nRonaldo was one of the first elite players to move to the Saudi Pro League when he left Manchester United and signed for Al Nassr in 2023.\n\n\"People don't know, they give their opinion, they talk too much,\" he said, when asked about the quality of the Saudi league.\n\n\"It's a shame, because it's a different reality when people talk about Arabia and the USA. [Is Major League Soccer worse?] Obviously, but as it's Arabia, it's disrespected ... People don't know what they're talking about. With those [players] who are here, you have to respect it.\"\n\nRonaldo discussed his departure from Real Madrid in 2018, saying the club \"didn't behave well with him\" in contract negotiations, but said he wouldn't rule out a return to the Bernab\u00e9u one day when his career ends.\n\nHe praised Madrid star Jude Bellingham, saying the England midfielder \"reminds me of [Zinedine] Zidane.\"\n\n\"Zidane was brilliant, beautiful,\" Ronaldo said. \"Bellingham is 21, he has his whole future ahead of him. The lad will be a top player.\"",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAnother fortnight without a break, another Musings that gets to cover two weeks' worth of ISL action. And some action it's been.\n\nWe muse, then, on matchweeks 18 and 19.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nOwen Coyle is feeling the pressure, and then some\n\nAfter Chennaiyin got smacked around by the Kerala Blasters at home, Owen Coyle trained his guns on ISL commentator Robin Singh in the post-match briefing. The reason for his ire? An admittedly poor decision to send Wilmar Jordan Gil off for a flailing hand in the 37th minute. You can understand why Coyle was angry, but he's seen worse and reacted better. His loss of control in going after Robin hinted at a deeper issue.\n\n11th in the league, ten points off the playoffs pace, without a win in their last seven (and just one, against Hyderabad, in their last 12), Chennaiyin's season has completely derailed. Quiet fan protest has now found voice, both online and off, and it appears evident that Coyle is feeling the heat. Can he buckle down and turn it around for a late unlikely charge for the top 6?\n\nThe Blasters soap opera rolls on\n\nA stumble in Kolkata against a fired up East Bengal. Beating neighbours Chennaiyin comprehensively a few days later. A normal couple of matches in what's been a proper rollercoaster of a season for the Blasters. But, but... a win and a loss? That's it? Well, no.\n\nKwame Peprah scored the third goal for Kerala Blasters against Chennaiyin FC. Shibu Preman/Focus Sports/FSDL\n\nIn the dying minutes of that game against Chennaiyin, arguably their performance of the season, Adrian Luna and Noah Sadaoui came this close to Lee Bowyer-Kieron Dyer part II. Luna was furious Sadaoui had shot instead of passing when 3-on-1, Sadaoui was furious because he saw that as a legitimate shooting opportunity, and Ishan Pandita (the free-est of the three on that counter, and most aggrieved party in all this) had to play the role of peacemaker. Now, of course, both Luna and Sadaoui are great professionals, and probably hashed it out in the dressing room immediately or at training the next day, but that little moment was another reminder that there is no such thing as a regular matchweek for the Kerala Blasters.\n\nHyderabad really are great spoilsports\n\nFirst, they pulled off draws (that probably deserved more) against title challengers FC Goa and Bengaluru. Then they pulled off a remarkable comeback to beat a very strong Jamshedpur outfit. Positive results against three of the best teams this season... and all done through solid performances. Shameel Chembakath has done a stellar job since taking over and his team has inadvertently done quite the job in ensuring Mohin Bagan get a free-ish run to the league shield.\n\nWhat's more, they're great fun to watch. The goals that brought them back against Jamshedpur -- Joseph Sunny's sublime touch and finish plus Andrei Alba's long-range howitzer -- exemplifies this.\n\nSure, like they did in the hammering by NorthEast United, they still sometimes slip into the poor habits that saw them start the season so slowly but the difference from week 1 to week 9 is stark: credit to Chembakath and the team for that.\n\nAlaeddine, the genie, can only do so much\n\nThere are dream debut seasons, and there's whatever Alaeddine Ajaraie is having in ISL 2024-25. 18 goals the man has now, the joint-most any player has ever scored in a single season and with five more games to go just in this league phase, that 'joint' won't be there for much longer.\n\nA force of goal-plundering nature, Alaeddine has been the genie NorthEast United have craved for so long, and his goals are powering them along in their quest for a place in the playoffs. But will it be enough?\n\nTake their game against Odisha on Monday, for instance. Alaeddine scored the two goals that put his team 2-1 up, but from the moment he got taken off it seemed inevitable Odisha would equalise -- and they did. Alaeddine's face at that moment made for quite the picture: it can't be all on him.\n\nWith just one win in their last six matches, their winning momentum from earlier in the season has stalled... while they maybe fourth in the table as things stand, they need to rediscover it pronto to keep away the charge that will surely come from those below them.\n\nJamshedpur are the business\n\nJavier Siverio scoring braces. Lazar Cirkovic scoring stunners. Mohammed Sanan sitting down fullback after fullback. Javi Hernandez doing whatever he likes. Beating Manolo Marquez's high-flying Goa 3 - 1 with 38% possession. Hello, Khalid Jamil, Indian football is a better place with you in it.\n\nAdimazes / ISL\n\nJamil's men have been in a proper run of form in this back half (especially at home), and while their poor early away form may have cost them a proper tilt at Mohun Bagan and their league shield, the playoffs will present a massive opportunity. Unlike the shield, the destination of the ISL cup is by no means a foregone conclusion, and Jamil's Jamshedpur are the main reason for that.\n\nSpeaking of, can we just crown Mohun Bagan champions now?\n\nIt's not just the fact that no one has conceded fewer goals than Mohun Bagan this season, it's that the next lowest have conceded eight more...and only one team has scored more. This season has been one long, nearly unbroken, exhibition of this Bagan squad's vast talents.\n\nThat league shield oughtn't be moving from the Bagan tent in the maidan now. Last season, they won it with 48 points in 22 games. This season they already have 43 in 19... and there's no one within striking distance -- not unless an out-of-the-blue implosion happens.\n\nThe Bengaluru implosion continues\n\nOh, what an implosion it's been. From leading the league to being tight challengers at the top to now barely clinging onto a top 6 post, it's been quite a back half to the season for Bengaluru FC. They have drawn one and lost five of their last six matches and the manner of the latest defeat underlines just how fast their freefall has become.\n\nThey took the lead only to be pegged back inside six minutes against Punjab. They then conceded again, before a stunning late equaliser in the 92nd minute. A draw in a match like this, seized in such a dramatic manner, might just have been the turning point Gerard Zaragoza and his men needed - but Luka Majcen sliced through their defence to score in the 96th minute and that was that.\n\nWith Jamshedpur coming to the Kanteerava next, Bengaluru will need to pull off something special to ensure they get some momentum going and keep what's become an elusive playoff place for them.\n\nMumbai City and Odisha are hanging on\n\nLooking on most gleefully at said BFC implosion are Odisha and Mumbai City. Both have shown glimpses of how good they can be (sample Isak's equaliser vs NEUFC) without doing anything that would mark them out as special. A loss here, a draw there, a win now and then, and they have just kept on keeping on all season long.\n\nMumbai don't concede much (second-best), but they don't score much (fourth worst); Odisha score a lot (joint second-best), but they concede a lot too (fourth worst); but in all this they have kept within range of the playoffs. Mumbai are sixth, and Odisha seventh, but if BFC keep slipping they are well poised to move a place up each.\n\nCan Punjab mount a late rush?\n\nThe team mostly like to make a charge from outside the current playoff spots, though, looks to be Punjab FC. Another team that started strong before petering into mediocrity, Luka Majcen's late winner against BFC was exactly the push they needed to remind themselves that they are so much better than they have shown recently. With a match in hand over Odisha and Mumbai and two over the Blasters, BFC and NEUFC, they really could make the race for the playoffs a thrilling finish.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 season of the Indian Super League is in full swing, and with games coming thick and fast, this is a convenient place to catch up on every match. We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nThe report on all matches from matchweek 19 is here.\n\nHere are the details for matchweek 20 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n\nOdisha FC 2-2 NorthEast United FC\n\n(Thoiba Morrangthem 78', Isak Ralte 90+4' - Alaeddine Ajaraie 67', 83')\n\nOdisha FC grabbed a crucial point in the playoff race, scoring in injury time to earn a 2-2 draw at home to NorthEast United. Alaeddine Ajaraie's brace looked to have given fourth-placed NorthEast the win, only for Isak Ralte to score a late equaliser and ensure Sergio Lobera's side were within three points of the final playoff spot.\n\nOdisha ought to have taken the lead in the 18th minute, when Jerry Mawihmingthanga missed from a yard out after mis-hitting Diego Mauricio's cross, and seconds later Rahul KP forced Gurmeet into a good save with a low drive. That proved to be as exciting as the first half was with both sides heading into the break goalless.\n\nAmrinder was forced into a couple of saves midway through the second half, before Alaeddine Ajaraie broke the deadlock with a header in the 67th minute, ghosting in at the far post to head home Buanthanglun Samte's cross. Isak Ralte then brought Odisha back into the game in identical fashion about ten minutes later, sending in a peach of a cross to the far post where Thoiba Moirangthem was on hand to equalize. However, Ajaraie was not to be stopped, and he restored NorthEast's lead in the 83rd minute, rising high to head Nestor Albiach's free kick from the left into the net. The Moroccan thus equalled equal Bart Ogbeche's single season scoring record (18) and Ferran 'Coro' Corominas' goal contribution record (23), and went off with a hamstring injury in added time. There was late drama in store, as Isak Ralte grabbed the equalizer for the hosts with a driving run, 1-2 with Mauricio and low finish into the bottom corner. The final whistle blew, but there was still time for Lobera to be sent off by the referee for dissent.\n\nJamshedpur 3-1 FC Goa\n\n(Lazar Cirkovic 34', Javi Siverio 38', 68' - Ayush Chhetri 45+2')\n\nJamshedpur FC leapfrogged FC Goa into second place in the ISL table, with a hard-fought 3-1 win over Manolo Marquez's side, that brought Khalid Jamil's side to nine points behind leaders Bagan, although JFC have a game in hand. Goa are now a point behind Jamshedpur in third place.\n\nGoa goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari started the game with a stunning double save from Imran Khan and Javi Siverio in the 10th minute. He had no chance against Jamshedpur centre-back Lazar Cirkovic's strike from range in the 34th minute, with his snapshot after pouncing on a loose ball curling into the top corner. Tiwari turned villain a few minutes later as Goa went two goals down, allowing Mohammed Sanan's shot to squeeze under him and Siverio pounced to tap the ball into an empty net. Goa did grab one back in first-half injury time, as Ayush Chhetri curled a shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box, making it 1-2 for the visitors going into the break.\n\nGoa nearly equalized 10 minutes into the second half, with substitute Mohammad Yasir's flick coming off the bar. Jamshedpur responded a few minutes after the hour mark with a shot off the bar too, with Siverio producing a stunning first-time volley from a long goal kick that cannoned off the crossbar. The striker then did send the ball into the net with his head, as Siverio headed home from a 68th minute corner, holding off Sandesh Jhingan to restore JFC's two-goal lead. Jamshedpur closed up shop after their third goal, and Goa struggled to create clear-cut chances as the game petered out and they finished with a loss.\n\nMohun Bagan 4-0 Mohammedan SC\n\nMohun Bagan's romp towards the league shield continued as they beat Mohammedan SC 4-0 in a convincing performance on Saturday evening.\n\nSubhasish Bose and Manvir Singh scored twice each, as Bagan were barely troubled, especially in the second half, after Mirjalol Kasimov was sent off in first half stoppage time. Bagan are 10 points ahead of FC Goa, albeit having played two games more than Manolo Marquez's side.\n\nPunjab FC 3-2 Bengaluru FC\n\nBengaluru FC's horror run in 2025 took another turn for the worse as they were beaten 3-2 by Punjab FC, thanks to Luka Majcen's 96th minute winner, which left the Blues with just a point from their last six games in the league, and puts them in serious danger of missing out on the playoffs.\n\nRahul Bheke had equalised for Bengaluru in the 92nd minute, with a great header from Edgar Mendez's cross, but they couldn't hold on for the point, with a nice flowing move ending up with Nihal Sudheesh crossing for Majcen to slot past Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.\n\nMumbai City FC 0-0 East Bengal\n\nIn a bit of a blow to both teams' hopes of making it to the ISL playoffs this season, Mumbai City FC and East Bengal played out a 0-0 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena on Friday evening.\n\nMumbai had more of the ball and more shots on goal as well, but just couldn't find their way past Prabhsukhan Gill in the East Bengal goal, with the best chances falling to Vikram Partap Singh, who couldn't quite put the ball in the back of the net. East Bengal had a big chance of their own, with Dimitrios Diamantakos's header hitting the post midway through the second half.\n\nAs it stands, Mumbai are sixth with 28 points in 18 games, the same as both Bengaluru FC and NorthEast United above them, while East Bengal are 10th with 18 points in as many games.\n\nChennaiyin FC 1-3 Kerala Blasters\n\n(Barretto 90+1' - Jimenez 3', Korou 45+3', Peprah 56')\n\nKerala Blasters continued their excellent recent form with a 3-1 win in Chennai that heaped more pressure on Owen Coyle and Chennaiyin FC, whose season appears to be hitting a dead end now.\n\nThe Blasters raced out of the traps, with Jesus Jimenez scoring in the third minute - his 11th goal of the season. Chennaiyin's task was made tougher by a red card shown to striker Wilman Jordan in the 37th minute. The Blasters made them pay in first half stoppage time, as Korou Singh's deflected strike from the right went past Mohammed Nawaz in the Chennaiyin goal.\n\nKwame Peprah added a third just 11 minutes after the break, after being beautifully set up by Adrian Luna. Vincy Barretto pulled a goal back for Chennaiyin in second half stoppage time, but that was merely a consolation.\n\nNorthEast United 4-1 Hyderabad FC\n\n(Guillermo 17', Ajaraie 45', Akhtar 79', Bemammer 89' - Manoj 70')\n\nNorthEast United climbed to fourth in the table with a comfortable 4-1 win over Hyderabad, leapfrogging Bengaluru FC on goal difference as the two both have 28 points from 18 games. Hyderabad remained second-from-bottom, 14 points behind the playoff spots with six games to go.\n\nNorthEast took the lead in the 17th minute thanks to some awful defending from Hyderabad. Jithin MS sent in a desperate cross from the byline, right to Abdul Rabeeh's head at the far post, but the defender inexplicably headed it back towards Guillermo Fernandez who tapped the ball home from a yard out at the near post to make it 1-0. The hosts made it 2-0 just before the break, with Alaeddine Ajaraie thundering a free kick right at Arshdeep Singh, but such was the power on the ball that it flew into the net.\n\nJust as it seemed that the hosts were coasting to a win in the second half, Hyderabad came back into the game with a goal in the 70th minute. Ramhlunchhunga Hmar sent in a free-kick from the right, and after his first attempt was blocked, Manoj Mohammed slammed the loose ball into the net from close range. His good work was soon undone however, as NEUFC restored their two-goal lead in the 79th minute. Nestor Albiach's corner from the right saw Ajaraie send a header goalwards, only for Arshdeep to save, but Asheer Akhtar headed it in from a yard out. Nestor missed a 1-on-1 went put through by Jithin in the final minutes, but Mohammed Bemammer made it 4-1 in the 89th minute after his long-range strike was deflected into the net. NEUFC missed a few more opportunities in injury time, but had to make do with the 4-1 scoreline at the final whistle.\n\nPunjab FC 1-2 Jamshedpur FC\n\n(Pratik 41', Javi 48'; Vidal 58')\n\nJamshedpur FC put their travelling blues to bay with a hard fought 2-1 win away at Punjab FC. Pratik Chaudhari opened the scoring with a thunderous header off a Rei Tachikawa set piece delivery late in the first half before Javi Hernandez charged down Punjab keeper Muheet Shabir to make it 2-0 early in the second. A Pulga Vidal shot from range closed the gap to one ten minutes later but Jamshedpur battened down the hatches for the last half hour.\n\nThe result sees JFC move to third, nine points off runaway leaders Mohun Bagan. Punjab, meanwhile, stay ninth, five points off sixth (the last playoff place)\n\nMohun Bagan 1-0 Bengaluru FC\n\n(Liston Colaco 74')\n\nA Liston Colaco wondergoal gave Mohun Bagan their first win in three, and extended Bengaluru FC's winless run in the calendar year 2025 to five games .Bagan extended their lead at the top to seven points over second-placed FC Goa, who have a game in hand.\n\nIt was a tight game at the Salt Lake, and the visitors did have the better of the first half. They should've gone into the break with the lead through Sunil Chhetri, who somehow missed a golden opportunity. He exchanged passes nicely with Alberto Noguera on the edge of the area, and then went through one-on-one with Vishal Kaith but dragged his shot wide of the near-post.\n\nBagan really didn't create that much until the goal, which came out of nothing. A cross from the left wing was cleared to the edge of the penalty area, from where Liston unleashed a sensational volley into the corner, well past the reach of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. Bengaluru could've equalised in stoppage time, but Rahul Bheke's header from point-blank range went just over the bar, as the Bagan faithful heaved a massive sigh of relief, at their team taking another giant stride towards retaining their league shield.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe January transfer window has officially closed and we're sifting through the deals and dollars to assess what every club managed to accomplish in the winter. However, this just brings us all one step closer to the summer window -- which runs from July 1 to Aug. 29 -- which is when teams will make bolder moves and a slew of high-profile free agents could potentially hit the market.\n\nSo, let's review which clubs got what they needed -- or didn't -- in the January window, and weigh that against what they'll need to address when the summer window arrives. After all, the time to look ahead to the next slate of moves is now for the top clubs throughout Europe.\n\nLiverpool\n\nArrivals: FW Kaide Gordon (Norwich City, loan ended)\n\nNotable departures: MF Stefan Bajcetic (Las Palmas, loan), DF Calvin Ramsay (Kilmarnock, loan)\n\nHow well did Liverpool meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nIf any club could afford not to bolster their squad in the transfer market this month, it's Liverpool.\n\nArne Slot's side has defied expectations to climb to the summit of the Premier League and Champions League tables and looks in rude health heading into the business end of the campaign. Standing pat and keeping on as the team has been appears to be a winning strategy.\n\nThat said, Liverpool could come to regret not making a defensive addition, with injuries to Joe Gomez and Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 at various points over the past few months having raised concerns over depth at the back, while Andy Robertson's erratic form has highlighted the need for a left-back.\n\nThe biggest disappointment this month, though, is that Liverpool have been unable to get Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk or Trent Alexander-Arnold signed to new deals. There remains an expectation that Salah and Van Dijk, at least, will commit their futures to Anfield, but the longer these sagas go on, the more unlikely that becomes.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nMuch of Liverpool's summer business will hinge on whether their out-of-contract trio signs new deals. As things stand, the Anfield club will have to replace their captain, vice captain and top goal scorer in the one window, and replacing players of that calibre will not come cheap.\n\nContract impasse aside, however, the most pressing issue in Slot's squad is probably at left-back. Robertson was integral to Liverpool's success under former manager Jurgen Klopp, but has struggled for form this term, while Kostas Tsimikas is not viewed as his long-term successor.\n\nWith the jury still out on whether Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez has a future on Merseyside and Diogo Jota still plagued by injuries, it would also be shrewd to invest in a first-choice No. 9, though the competition for such a player is likely to be fierce, with many of Europe's top clubs in a similar position.\n\nDefensive midfield was Liverpool's biggest priority last summer, with Liverpool coming close to striking a deal for Real Sociedad's Mart\u00edn Zubimendi, who now looks set to join Arsenal at the end of the season. Ryan Gravenberch's emergence as one of the best No. 6's in world football diminishes the need to strengthen in that area of the pitch. However, considering the amount of games Slot's side are likely to play in all competitions next term, bringing in a rotational option would be wise, particularly if Japan international Wataru Endo should leave the club. -- Beth Lindop\n\nArsenal\n\nArrivals: None\n\nNotable departures: DF Ayden Heaven (Man United)\n\nplay 2:26 Marcotti: Arsenal title hopes rest on Havertz fitness Gabriele Marcotti believes Arsenal's titles hopes are very dependent on keeping Kai Havertz fit for the rest of the season.\n\nHow well did Arsenal meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nTo be blunt, they didn't meet them at all.\n\nIf Arsenal gambled by opting against signing a striker last summer, then choosing not to do so again in January is a brave move to double down given the stakes.\n\nManchester City's dramatic fall from grace has created an unexpected opportunity to win the Premier League -- a feeling exacerbated by the Gunners' 5-1 win over Pep Guardiola's side on Sunday -- and many wanted Arsenal to risk a signing or two to give them the best shot at glory in the run-in. Two serious injuries to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus prompted Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta to publicly change his stance through the course of the window from being open to a new signing to insisting the club were seeking to act with significant urgency.\n\nAs it was, the Gunners made a late attempt to pry Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa with a bid that fell considerably short of his valuation. They looked at loan options including a deal for Mathys Tel, but they decided to go with what they have and pursue longer-term targets in the summer. It is a judgment call that may well define their season.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nArsenal made a head start in their summer planning by advancing a deal to sign Zubimendi from Real Sociedad. That agreement is not finalised, but all signs are that the 26-year-old will move to Emirates Stadium in what represents a significant coup given Liverpool, Manchester City and other major clubs were credited with an interest.\n\nThe expected arrival of Zubimendi also eases pressure on the two midfielders who are out of contract at the end of the season. Jorginho is expected to leave and is close to agreeing to move to Brazilian club Flamengo, while it's still unclear whether Thomas Partey will be offered a new deal. The 31-year-old would have to take a pay cut if a fresh contract is forthcoming given that he earns around \u00a3250,000 a week.\n\nOf course, the big issue remains around a centre-forward. It would be a surprise if Arsenal pushed again for Watkins -- though the 29-year-old is a Gunners fan and would be open to a move if Villa allowed it -- and more likely they will revert to one of their leading targets.\n\nArsenal have been tracking Benjamin Sesko since before last summer, when he chose to sign a new contract to stay at Red Bull Leipzig. There is a suggestion he will be allowed to leave this summer for a fee between \u20ac70m to \u20ac75m. That would be of interest to Arsenal, as would any encouragement Newcastle were willing to offload Alexander Isak.\n\nThere are other players in different positions under consideration, too, including Nico Williams at Athletic Bilbao. They will also have a question to answer in goal, with Neto's seasonlong loan as David Raya's backup set to expire. -- James Olley\n\nChelsea\n\nArrivals: DF Trevoh Chalobah (Crystal Palace, loan ended)\n\nNotable departures: MF Cesare Casadei (Torino), MF Carney Chukwuemeka (Borussia Dortmund, loan), DF Renato Veiga (Juventus, loan)\n\nplay 1:19 Laurens: Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix hasn't deserved any of his big transfer moves Julien Laurens reacts to Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix's impending move to AC Milan on loan from Chelsea.\n\nHow well did Chelsea meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nWell, their spending had to slow down sometime. Chelsea need further squad reconstruction to become serious Premier League title contenders, but a period of relative calm was inevitable after the outlay of more than \u00a31 billion since the new owners took charge in May 2022.\n\nRecalling Trevoh Chalobah from his loan at Crystal Palace was a short-term measure that made sense, and they continued their policy of trying to identify the best future prospects with a deal worth \u20ac15m for Saint-Etienne's teenage midfielder Mathis Amougou. Interestingly, the 19-year-old is expected to join up with Chelsea's first-team squad.\n\nMeanwhile, securing exits for fringe players including Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Axel Disasi, in addition to receiving around \u20ac15m from Torino for Cesare Casadei, helps give a once-bloated squad a more streamlined feel.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nGiven neither Graham Potter nor Mauricio Pochettino lasted more than one full season as manager under Chelsea's owners, the future of Enzo Maresca cannot be guaranteed. A top-five finish, which is likely to be good enough for Champions League qualification, would likely be enough to keep the Italian in the post a while longer.\n\nThe Blues' transfer strategy -- signing top young talent on long contracts with incremental incentives built in -- is well established regardless of who the head coach is, but Maresca and his staff will inevitably shape some of Chelsea's thinking this summer. There is a strong suspicion that Chelsea need an upgrade in goal, at centre-back and at centre-forward. It is difficult, although not impossible, to see goalkeeper Robert S\u00e1nchez lasting at the club amid persistent external criticism of his decision-making.\n\nplay 1:51 Hislop underwhelmed by Chelsea's comeback win over West Ham Shaka Hislop and Mario Melchiot share their frustrations with Chelsea after their comeback win over West Ham in the Premier League.\n\nElsewhere, the Blues tried late in the summer window to sign Victor Osimhen before he left Napoli for Galatasaray. It might be one they revisit, though they've also tracked Liam Delap at Ipswich Town. Should Ipswich be relegated from the top flight, a deal would become theoretically cheaper and easier to complete.\n\nBenjamin Sesko (Red Bull Leipzig) or Alexander Isak (Newcastle) could also be of interest, while talk of a move for Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho dominated much of January without ever really going anywhere. Chelsea would also be open to a move for Kobbie Mainoo if United's financial position forced them to offload. -- Olley\n\nManchester City\n\nArrivals: MF Nico Gonzalez (FC Porto), FW Omar Marmoush (Eintracht Frankfurt), DF Abdukodir Khusanov (Lens), DF Vitor Reis (Palmeiras), MF Claudio Echeverri (River Plate)\n\nNotable departures: DF Kyle Walker (AC Milan, loan)\n\nplay 1:25 Laurens: Man City should've had Nico Gonz\u00e1lez in on January 1st Julien Laurens looks at new Manchester City midfielder Nico Gonz\u00e1lez and explains why Pep Guardiola needed him a month ago.\n\nHow well did Man City meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nCity left it late, but they got the central midfielder they wanted in Nico Gonzalez. Losing Rodri has had a major impact on their season and the hope is that Gonzalez can soften the blow until he returns.\n\nOmar Marmoush was also a key signing to replace Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, as City have missed Alvarez's goals since he left for Atletico Madrid last summer. Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis were identified as summer transfer targets, but they've been brought to the club early to help cope with continued injury problems in defence. R\u00faben Dias and Nathan Ak\u00e9 are still out while John Stones has struggled to stay available.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nCity didn't do much transfer business last summer and Guardiola ended up regretting it. They're unlikely to make the same mistake again, and there's a feeling around the club that there could be some major changes to the squad at the end of the season.\n\nThe old guard has already started to move out with Kyle Walker's transfer to Milan, and there's the possibility that others could follow. Kevin De Bruyne is out of contract and his future remains up in the air. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan could also be leaving just one year after his return from Barcelona.\n\nplay 1:49 Why are Man City struggling against bigger teams this season? Julien Laurens believes that Manchester City struggle to play their best football against the big teams this season.\n\nUltimately, City's strong position in line with PSR (profit and sustainability rules), means they will have money to spend. Check-in calls have been made on Bayern Munich pair Joshua Kimmich and Jamal Musiala: Kimmich is out of contract in the summer and Musiala's deal expires the year after. There's interest in Juventus full-back Andrea Cambiaso and Atalanta midfielder \u00c9derson.\n\nLike everyone, City are waiting to discover the outcome of the Premier League's case against them for alleged financial regulation breaches, and the punishment -- if any -- may shape what they can do in the summer. The plan right now is to reestablish City as the dominant team in England after a disappointing campaign. -- Rob Dawson\n\nManchester United\n\nArrivals: DF Patrick Dorgu (Lecce), DF Ayden Heaven (Arsenal)\n\nNotable departures: FW Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa, loan), FW Antony (Real Betis, loan)\n\nplay 2:32 Can Patrick Dorgu help with Man United's system? Luis Miguel Echegaray breaks down Manchester United's most recent signing, Patrick Dorgu, as United continue to struggle with Ruben Amorim's formation changes.\n\nHow well did Man United meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nUnited's priority in the January window was to sign a left wing-back, and they've done that with the \u20ac35m arrival of Patrick Dorgu from Lecce. It was the position that manager Ruben Amorim was focused on because it helps him implement his 3-4-3 system, and he'll be happy the club got someone over the line.\n\nOne issue that has not been addressed, though, is the chronic lack of goals. In fact, Amorim has seen his attacking options diminish with the departures of Antony to Real Betis and Marcus Rashford to Aston Villa. Rashford hasn't played for more than a month, but still has more Premier League goals than Man United forwards Rasmus H\u00f8jlund and Joshua Zirkzee this season.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nA lot.\n\nThe first thing United need to do is to secure permanent exits for a number of senior players. Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Christian Eriksen will leave on free transfers. United also need to get Casemiro and Antony -- as a minimum -- off the books as quickly as possible. The long-term futures of Rashford, Zirkzee and Harry Maguire are also up in the air.\n\nplay 2:04 Laurens slams Amorim after another Man United defeat Julien Laurens goes in on Ruben Amorim's decision to play Kobbie Mainoo as a striker following another home defeat for Manchester United vs. Crystal Palace.\n\nYou could argue that every area of the squad needs to be strengthened. They are certainly in need of a quality striker, but finances are tight at Old Trafford and high-class goal scorers don't come cheap. There is interest in Viktor Gy\u00f6keres at Amorim's former club, Sporting CP, while Jonathan David -- available on a free transfer in the summer -- is a cheaper option.\n\nUnited are also looking closely at Gyokeres' Sporting teammate Geovany Quenda. There's hope he could be acquired for around \u20ac60m, but United are likely to face stiff competition for his signature. Former academy player Angel Gomes is another option. Like his Lille teammate David, he's also out of contract in the summer.\n\nUnited are planning an overhaul of the squad in the summer -- an effort to give Amorim more of the tools he needs -- as long as their limited budget stretches that far. -- Dawson\n\nTottenham\n\nArrivals: GK Antonin Kinsky (Slavia Prague), DF Kevin Danso (Lens), FW Mathys Tel (Bayern Munich, loan)\n\nNotable departures: None\n\nplay 1:50 Laurens: Postecoglou changed Tel's mind after initial Spurs rejection Julien Laurens explains how a chat with Ange Postecoglou made Mathys Tel change his mind and accept a loan move to Tottenham.\n\nHow well did Tottenham meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nThey left it late -- what's new? -- but Tottenham have managed to bolster their squad in a manner that has given manager Ange Postecoglou something to work with.\n\nThey almost had to sign Antonin Kinsky given injuries to goalkeepers Guglielmo Vicario and Fraser Forster, but there will be a degree of satisfaction at Spurs that they beat several Premier League clubs in the race to sign Mathys Tel from Bayern Munich, albeit tempered by the fact they compromised on a straight loan with no option having initially pushed for a \u20ac60m permanent deal.\n\nTel gives Postecoglou the attacking option he craved while at the back, while Kevin Danso's arrival from RC Lens helps offset a season-ending injury to defender Radu Dragusin. They wanted more -- failed pursuits for Axel Disasi, who left Aston Villa for Chelsea; Randal Kolo Muani, who joined Juventus from PSG; and Fikayo Tomori, who stayed at AC Milan are evidence of that -- but something is better than the nothing it long appeared was likely.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nA lot will depend on Postecoglou's future. The 59-year-old is under mounting pressure given Spurs are 15th in the Premier League, but the cup competitions offer hope of a first trophy since 2008. He may have to deliver one to save his job.\n\nEither way, the club are likely to strengthen their forward line in the summer, as Tel will return to Bayern while Timo Werner's loan is unlikely to be renewed. Pair that with growing fears that Son Heung-Min may not quite be the all-conquering force he once was, and the need for attacking reinforcements is clear.\n\nplay 1:47 Can Tottenham's win against Brentford turn their season around? Janusz Michallik reacts to Tottenham's 2-0 win away at Brentford in the Premier League.\n\nSpurs have an eye on Jack Grealish, though it is unclear whether they would make a move for the England winger should he decide to leave Manchester City. Grealish turns 30 in September and Spurs typically target younger players. They also need a robust defensive midfielder able to give them greater control in matches. Among the defensive options Spurs have scouted are Gon\u00e7alo Inacio at Sporting Lisbon.\n\nRumours also persist about the club being up for sale, and any new owners could of course rip up the rulebook and go for broke. After years of conservatism in the market, many Spurs fans would welcome that. -- Olley\n\nBarcelona\n\nArrivals: GK Wojciech Szczesny (free agent)\n\nNotable departures: None\n\nHow well did Barcelona meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nBarcelona have a relatively settled side at the moment, but in an ideal world, they would have strengthened in some areas during this window. Another forward, preferably someone able to play wide, would have been welcome.\n\nThey held talks about a deal for Marcus Rashford, but it wasn't financially viable. Depth is also desired at the full-back positions, but they were never close to recruiting competition for Jules Kound\u00e9 or Alejandro Balde in part because of the club's ongoing financial limitations.\n\nInstead, they spent January trying to maintain Dani Olmo's and Pau V\u00edctor's registrations in the face of the club's failure to get compliant with LaLiga's financial fair play rules. They eventually did get it done, but only via a temporary order from Spain's sports ministry. They also focused on renewing contracts, with Ronald Ara\u00fajo, Gavi and Pedri all signing new deals, too. None of them are shiny new signings, but assuring their futures remain at the club was arguably more important than adding more bodies for the sake of it.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nBar\u00e7a have various needs to address in the summer, some more pressing than others. A forward -- preferably a left winger -- is on the list.\n\nAt some point they will also need to explore signing another No. 9 as Robert Lewandowski turns 37 this year. The Polish striker remains in good form, though, scoring 30 goals already this season -- he's also set to play enough games (at least 45 minutes in 55% of Barca's fixtures) to trigger an automatic contract extension until 2026.\n\nElsewhere, Bar\u00e7a do want to sign a full-back. Either side will do -- or someone who can play right or left -- as they feel Kounde and Balde need more support and more competition. The centre-back situation is also constantly changing. After Araujo's renewal, it is not as clear if they will still go for Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah, who is out of contract in the summer. It may depend on the futures of Eric Garc\u00eda and Andreas Christensen, but Tah may also have been put off by Araujo's renewal, coupled with the form of Pau Cubars\u00ed and I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez.\n\nThat leaves the goalkeeper situation, which is a delicate area at Bar\u00e7a at the moment. I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a has been cast aside by Hansi Flick for Wojciech Szczesny, who signed through the summer as cover for the injured Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen. But how, and when, will Ter Stegen come back? Could Pe\u00f1a feel it's time to move on? Will Szcz\u0119sny stick around? If an alternative option comes up and Bar\u00e7a have the finances to pounce, they may well act.\n\nFinally, teenage sensation Lamine Yamal will extend his contract until 2030 at some point soon -- if not before the summer -- and the club also have to try to convince Frenkie de Jong to renew or risk losing him for free in 2026. -- Sam Marsden, Moises Llorens\n\nReal Madrid\n\nArrivals: None\n\nNotable departures: None\n\nplay 1:07 Real Madrid's outlook after 'disappointing' Espanyol loss Gemma Soler breaks down Real Madrid's disappointing defeat and what it means moving forward.\n\nHow well did Real Madrid meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nThey didn't.\n\nReal Madrid needed to strengthen their defence this window, and after Liverpool rebuffed an early approach to sign Trent Alexander-Arnold this month, they opted not to do so. It means that Lucas V\u00e1zquez, a loyal servant who has repeatedly been exposed defensively this season, remains Madrid's only option at right-back.\n\nAt centre-back, untimely injuries for Antonio R\u00fcdiger and David Alaba this week mean Madrid will go into crunch games like Saturday's Madrid Derby and next week's Champions League playoff first leg with Manchester City fielding a makeshift partnership of midfielder Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and youngster Ra\u00fal Asencio.\n\nMadrid's decision to postpone any reinforcements until this summer means they go into a critical phase of the season with an already shaky defence looking weaker than ever. It's quite a gamble.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nThe arrival of Alexander-Arnold is still Madrid's top priority, now -- as was their original intention, before Dani Carvajal's long-term injury increased their urgency -- on a free transfer in the summer. The Liverpool lad would be a multipurpose solution for Madrid: providing long-term competition for Carvajal at right-back, and also adding to the team's deep-lying creativity and long-range passing options, which have been lacking since the retirement of Toni Kroos.\n\nMadrid have also been on the lookout for a fourth elite centre-back to complement Rudiger, Alaba and \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o. Asencio, 21, has outperformed expectations since being drafted in, but Madrid may still look to make a signing in the position, with Militao having suffered two consecutive cruciate ligament injuries and Alaba's long-term prospects uncertain having just returned from an ACL himself at 32.\n\nIn midfield, the prominence of Dani Ceballos alongside Federico Valverde in recent weeks has highlighted Madrid's need for that kind of tempo-setting, ballplaying central midfielder, too: but perhaps one with a better injury record, and higher ceiling, than Ceballos.\n\nMadrid's other, major preoccupation this summer will be Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior's future. The Ballon d'Or runner-up's contract is up in June 2027. Vin\u00edcius entertained interest from the Saudi Pro League last summer, and the Saudis have stayed in touch with his representatives. This summer, the Brazil international will have a big decision to make and if Madrid want to keep him, they'll have to offer him a significant pay raise. -- Alex Kirkland, Rodri Faez\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nArrivals: None\n\nNotable departures: MF Arthur Vermeeren (RB Leipzig)\n\nHow well did Atletico Madrid meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nAtletico didn't have any urgent needs in this transfer window.\n\nThey invested heavily last summer, bringing in Julian Alvarez, Alexander Sorloth, Robin Le Normand and Conor Gallagher, which left them with arguably the most complete, well-rounded squad in LaLiga. As a result, they were never going to be busy in January. Any business would have been contingent on moving a high-earner -- and in particular, injury-hit midfielder Thomas Lemar, who has made just one league appearance this season.\n\nAtletico couldn't drum up any interest in Lemar, and that meant they couldn't seriously look at making a signing, either.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nThe top position Atletico would like to strengthen is in central midfield, with the addition of a deep-lying pivot, a creative midfielder, or both. Club captain Koke is being slowly phased out of the team -- seven of his 21 LaLiga appearances this season have come as a substitute -- and while Rodrigo De Paul is having his most consistent campaign yet, and Pablo Barrios is an exciting homegrown talent, they could do with some competition, especially with coach Diego Simeone seeming to prefer Gallagher out wide.\n\nOne name mentioned by sources as a priority target is Villarreal's in-demand playmaker \u00c1lex Baena, who just turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia and has an accessible release clause in his contract. Baena didn't want to leave Villarreal midseason, but he might just be persuaded to join Atletico this summer, having said in December that he would depart for only \"a top-10 club in the world.\" Otherwise, Atletico won't be as active this summer as they were last.\n\nOne player to watch is Antoine Griezmann. A superfan of U.S. sports, he's made it clear that he'd like to play in MLS one day; the only question is when. -- Kirkland, Faez\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nArrivals: FW Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli)\n\nNotable departures: MF Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig), MF Cher Ndour (Fiorentina), MF Marco Asensio (Aston Villa, loan), DF Milan Skriniar (Fenerbahce, loan), FW Randal Kolo Muani (Juventus, loan)\n\nplay 1:16 Gab & Juls not convinced Kvaratskhelia is a smart signing for PSG Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens question if Napoli's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, another winger, is a smart signing for PSG.\n\nHow well did PSG meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nPSG did exactly what they wanted and needed. After missing out on the signing of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia last summer, they went back for the Napoli winger and this time managed to recruit him for \u20ac65m. He was their priority and really the only player they wanted in this window. They did look at a defender, but decided not to move.\n\nThe club's other objective was to reduce their squad in terms of numbers, and they managed to loan out playmaker Marco Asensio (to Aston Villa), defender Milan Skriniar (to Fenerbah\u00e7e) and forward Randal Kolo Muani (to Juventus). They also concluded a permanent transfer with RB Leipzig for Xavi Simons -- \u20ac50m, plus \u20ac30m in bonuses -- which is straight profit considering they got him as a free agent at 16. Overall, a great move toward balancing their books.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nThe summer should be very interesting. Manager Luis Enrique and sporting director Luis Campos are hoping this squad reaches new levels in the second half of the season so that they have to make only a couple of adjustments prior to next season. They are convinced that they will be able to keep all their best players -- Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Bradley Barcola, Vitinha, Jo\u00e3o Neves, Willian Pacho, Achraf Hakimi, Warren Za\u00efre-Emery and Kvaratskhelia, to name just a few -- and so then they can just focus on strengthening two positions: goalkeeper and centre-back.\n\nIn goal, there are doubts over the future of 25-year-old Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has blown hot and cold at times since joining the club in July 2021 as a free agent. He wants to stay, but there are no talks about extending his contract after 2027. According to reports, 23-year-old Lucas Chevalier, the very promising Lille No. 1, is a target to replace the Italian.\n\nIn central defence, with Marquinhos turning 31 in May and Lucas Beraldo struggling to convince, the Parisians will look at options. At the moment, they have two players on their short list, sources tell ESPN: Ronald Araujo, if Barcelona have to let him go, and Illia Zabarnyi, who is having a great season with Bournemouth. They should have around \u20ac150m to spend on enhancing these two positions. -- Julien Laurens\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nArrivals: MF Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea, loan), DF Daniel Svensson (Nordsjaelland, loan), MF Salih \u00d6zcan (Wolfsburg, loan ended)\n\nNotable departures: FW Donyell Malen (Aston Villa), FW Sebastien Haller (FC Utrecht, loan)\n\nplay 1:28 Why it's time for Gio Reyna and Dortmund to part ways Derek Rae joins \"Futbol Americas\" to make the case for Gio Reyna leaving Borussia Dortmund to become a regular starter elsewhere.\n\nHow well did Borussia Dortmund meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nDortmund's biggest issue during the January window was the fact that the club only started to be proactive on the market once Niko Kova\u010d was signed, following the sacking of previous manager Nuri \u015eahin.\n\nAt the end of the window, Dortmund made a big push in the transfer market, loaning left-back Daniel Svensson from Nordsjaelland as well as Carney Chukwuemeka from Chelsea. Chukwuemeka is on loan from Chelsea and could be signed permanently only for a fee close to \u20ac50m.\n\nDortmund also recalled midfielder Salih \u00d6zcan from his loan at Wolfsburg, after Felix Nmecha had been diagnosed with a ligament tear. By adding Svensson, Dortmund addressed their shortage of quality full-backs, while Chukwuemeka can be seen as reinforcement for the central midfield just like \u00d6zcan.\n\nDortmund also intended to sign Rayan Cherki as a replacement for Donyell Malen, but the deal ultimately fell through because Lyon rejected Dortmund's deadline day offer. The timing of the offer might have been bad due the club's delayed activity as explained above. Malen, however, was offloaded to Aston Villa for a \u00a321m fee earlier in the window.\n\nIt's hard to say whether Dortmund addressed all their needs in January because the overlaying question remains whether the squad is not good enough or the coaching has been responsible for a disappointing campaign.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nBefore any future transfers should be made, Dortmund need to decide what kind of club they want to be. They could easily offload Jamie Gittens for a transfer fee beyond \u20ac50m, but that would also mean Dortmund lose another talented young player soon after they broke through. Year after year, it seems as if Dortmund lose a few percent of their quality and if that trend continues, the club are in danger of falling well behind Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nEven though they have just signed Svensson, Dortmund might have to sign another full-back who can offer them offensive productivity. Moreover, the team are in need of a transition midfielder who can play between the No. 6 and the attacking midfield.\n\nOn the other side, the club's higher-ups together with manager Niko Kova\u010d, who has signed a contract until 2026, need to decide who out of the current squad should be moved on. The contracts of Niklas S\u00fcle, Giovanni Reyna, Emre Can, Julian Brandt and Pascal Gross run out in 2026. If Dortmund aren't convinced by some of these players, they need to be sold next summer. -- Constantin Eckner\n\nBayern Munich\n\nArrivals: GK Jonas Urbig (Cologne)\n\nNotable departures: FW Mathys Tel (Tottenham, loan), FW Nestory Irankunda (Grasshoppers, loan)\n\nplay 1:28 What went wrong for Bayern in Champions League defeat? Stewart Robson discusses where Bayern Munich faltered in their 3-0 defeat to Feyenoord.\n\nHow well did Bayern Munich meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nAs predicted by Bayern Munich's director of sport Max Eberl before the transfer window opened, Bayern remained pretty inactive in January. In fact, the only signings the record German champions made were done to put things in place for the future. Goalkeeper talent Jonas Urbig has joined the club immediately and will get some playing time next season. Meanwhile, 19-year-old midfielder Tom Bischof will come on a free transfer from Hoffenheim after the season.\n\nOne talent that has left Bayern is Mathys Tel. Last week, Bayern and Tottenham reached an agreement over a \u20ac60m transfer, but Tel did not want to join Spurs at the time. On deadline day, the 19-year-old winger changed his mind and ultimately moved to Tottenham on loan, with an option for the Premier League club to sign him permanently for \u20ac55m.\n\nBayern had hoped to extend the contracts of Joshua Kimmich, Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala in January. While some hiccups have prolonged the negotiations, it remains probable that these players will extend their respective deals. Manuel Neuer extended his contract until 2026, apparently agreeing to give up a small portion of next season's games to Urbig.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nEberl's skills as a dealmaker will be tested this year because he has been asked to reduce the salary budget by \u20ac40 million, which would mean the club spends less than \u20ac300m on salaries every year. This will even be harder if Kimmich, Davies and Musiala all stay. For instance, the contract that has been proposed to Davies would run until 2030 and have a value of \u20ac120m.\n\nTo reduce ongoing expenses, Bayern might part ways with veteran squad members like Leon Goretzka, Serge Gnabry, Leroy San\u00e9 and Kingsley Coman. While San\u00e9's contract runs out at the end of the season, Bayern could find new clubs for Gnabry and Coman and recoup respectable fees.\n\nAt the same time, Eberl would have to find one or more replacements especially on the wing, with Dortmund's Gittens and Chelsea's Christopher Nkunku being potential targets. While the transfer fees for both would be high, the salaries should be lower than what San\u00e9 or Gnabry commanded in Munich. Also, it is understood that Bayern's interest in Florian Wirtz will be unaffected by any plans to save money as he remains the No. 1 target for Bayern.\n\nBayern will also be tasked with finding a competitive striker as a backup for Harry Kane. Even though the England skipper is scoring on a weekly basis, he is getting up there in age and a significant injury would leave Bayern in danger. -- Eckner\n\nBayer Leverkusen\n\nArrivals: DF Mario Hermoso (Roma, loan), FW Emiliano Buend\u00eda (Aston Villa, loan)\n\nNotable departures: None\n\nHow well did Bayer Leverkusen meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nLeverkusen didn't have to address any pressing needs during the January window and thus remained rather quiet, only loaning defender Mario Hermoso from Roma and attacking midfielder Emiliano Buend\u00eda from Aston Villa.\n\nHermoso has not been brought in as a potential replacement for Jonathan Tah: the German international's contract ends in June, and he will be on his way out at the end of the season. Instead, Leverkusen signed Hermoso on a loan deal to fill Jeanu\u00ebl Belocian's gap because Belocian has suffered an ACL tear. Buend\u00eda, meanwhile, is a temporary replacement for Martin Terrier, who will be out for a while due to a ruptured Achilles tendon.\n\nMeanwhile, Leverkusen have made progress in negotiations with Wirtz over a potential contract extension until 2028. The sole point of disagreement remains the value of a release clause, with Leverkusen for a fixed transfer fee of \u20ac150m; Wirtz's camp would prefer \u20ac100m.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nIt would help Leverkusen tremendously to reach an agreement with Wirtz until the summer and thereby immediatelyo eliminate most of the rumours regarding their playmaker. Moreover, Leverkusen need to find a viable successor to Tah or add a quality defender to their squad and promote one of their other defenders. Edmond Tapsoba in particular has the makings of a defensive leader.\n\nMoreover, Victor Boniface's future has become uncertain this season -- he was on the verge of joining Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, only for the deal to fall through during the January window. If the 24-year-old is determined to leave Leverkusen, the Werkself need to find another high-level striker. It would be unwise for Xabi Alonso & Co. to rely on Patrik Schick given his injury history, even though he has been in peak form this season.\n\nMoreover, Leverkusen will need to evaluate if any of their three loan players -- Hermoso, Buend\u00eda and Nordi Mukiele -- could and should be signed on a permanent deal. Mukiele is an interesting option at right-back from a tactical standpoint.\n\nAt the same time, the team might be in need of some fresh blood, with a few ageing players possibly declining next season, with 35-year-old goalkeeper Luk\u00e1\u0161 Hr\u00e1deck\u00fd and 32-year-old midfielder Jonas Hofmann coming to mind. -- Eckner\n\nAC Milan\n\nArrivals: FW Santiago Gim\u00e9nez (Feyenoord), DF Kyle Walker (Man City, loan)\n\nNotable departures: DF Davide Calabria (Bologna), FW \u00c1lvaro Morata (Galatasaray, loan)\n\nplay 2:33 Gomez: Gim\u00e9nez to AC Milan would benefit all parties Herculez Gomez believes an agreement between Feyenoord and AC Milan for Santiago Gim\u00e9nez will benefit all parties involved.\n\nHow well did AC Milan meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nThe big one, obviously, is the arrival of Santiago Gim\u00e9nez. They were crying out for a top-drawer centre-forward: It may take him some time to settle and at \u20ac35m, he represents a commitment, but they have one now. Shifting \u00c1lvaro Morata on loan was necessary to keep the books balanced, but in any case, he had developed into more of a No. 10.\n\nIs Kyle Walker an upgrade over Davide Calabria (who joined Bologna) and Emerson Royal at right-back? Maybe, maybe not. Warren Bondo is another dynamic body in midfield, certainly more so than the exiting Isma\u00ebl Bennacer.\n\nThe gamble is Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, who arrives on loan. He's a huge talent who's never quite gotten it together: this has \"Uncle\" Jorge Mendes' (who also represents coach S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o) fingerprints all over it. It's a weird one too, given his best position are at No. 10 or on the left wing and arguably Milan's two best players -- Christian Pulisic and Rafael Le\u00e3o -- tend to occupy those roles. Riccardo Sottil is another wide option I guess.\n\nAll in all, a lot of wheeling and dealing plus a lot of short-term stuff: other than Gimenez, I don't love any of it.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nThat's an open-ended question given so many players are on loan or on short-term deals. And obviously, it's all subordinate to whether Concei\u00e7\u00e3o does well enough to stick around as manager. Assuming he does, they will have to make a big call on Felix, since he won't come cheap (in terms of transfer fee and wages). If he turns out to be a dud (again), they'll want to find a viable option on the right wing, or a No. 10 and move Pulisic to the right flank on a permanent basis.\n\nThe midfield is pretty settled otherwise, though against teams that park the bus, a deep-lying playmaker type might come in handy. At the back, it's anyone's guess. Theo Hern\u00e1ndez is a crap shoot -- a liability and superstar rolled into one -- at left back, while right back remains up in the air.\n\nAnd then there's central defence: they hope Strahinja Pavlovic and Malick Thiaw play well enough to keep the job, but that's by no means guaranteed. Expect them to move again in the market if either comes up short. -- Gab Marcotti\n\nInter Milan\n\nArrivals: DF Nicola Zalewski (Roma, loan)\n\nNotable departures: None\n\nHow well did Inter Milan meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nInter have a deep squad, and they got their contract renewals done, at least for the guys they risk losing -- some of the older ones, like Stefan de Vrij, Francesco Acerbi and Matteo Darmian, they can slow-play. Tajon Buchanan was getting no playing time, so it's good that they sent him on loan to Villarreal; Nicola Zalewski, who arrived on loan from Roma, gives manager Simone Inzaghi yet another wide alternative.\n\nAll around, job done.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nThey're actually in pretty good shape. They'll want an alternative in goal to Yann Sommer, who turns 37 thi year, but they hope Filip Stankovic (on loan at Venezia) can be that guy. If they don't extend De Vrij's contract, they could probably use another center back though again, they'll see if Tomas Palacios can provide an in-house solution.\n\nMehdi Taremi divides opinion as a third striker and they'll want a fourth, but they also feel that in the Esposito brothers (Francesco Pio and Sebastiano) and Mart\u00edn Satriano, they have kids on loan who could make the grade. Otherwise, they'll look to shift one of them and spend on another striker.\n\nAll the above, of course, is contingent on them hanging on to their crown jewels (Alessandro Bastoni, Fede Dimarco, Marcus Thuram, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez). If the right offer comes in, Inter will cave and then they'll have to find a replacement. -- Marcotti\n\nJuventus\n\nArrivals: DF Alberto Costa (Vitoria de Guimaraes), DF Lloyd Kelly (Newcastle, loan), DF Renato Veiga (Chelsea, loan), FW Randal Kolo Muani (Paris Saint-Germain, loan)\n\nDepartures: MF Arthur Melo (Girona, loan), DF Danilo (Flamengo, loan)\n\nHow well did Juventus meet their transfer needs in January?\n\nJuve needed bodies at the back and got them in the form of Alberto Costa from Vitoria Guimaraes, Renato Veiga from Chelsea and Lloyd Kelly from Newcastle, the latter two on loan. It's nothing to write home about, but at least Costa is young.\n\nThey failed to find a home for Dusan Vlahovic (he had all the leverage anyway) and that could come back to bite them. Either he extends his deal (with a hefty pay cut), or he'll be a year away from free agency in the summer, which isn't great. As for Randall Kolo Muani, they needed another centre-forward, so I guess there's that. I'm just not excited by any of these names: then again, they're on a budget.\n\nWhat transfer needs must they address in the summer?\n\nA lot, and a lot will depend on whether they want to continue with Thiago Motta at the helm.\n\nAssuming they do, they'll want to address the centre-forward situation. It's hard to see how Vlahovic can stay -- he'll have a year left on his deal at a monster wage -- and they'll have to decide on Kolo Muani, who is on loan from PSG. Either way, they're OK in terms of wingers, but you could see them sacrificing someone like Kenan Yildiz to raise the funds to strengthen elsewhere, especially if Motta stays. They'll also need to add depth in midfield and decide what they want to do with Weston McKennie.\n\nAt the back, it will depend on what condition Bremer and Cabal are in when they return from their long injuries. Making Pierre Kalulu's deal permanent is a no-brainer, but Milan may have other ideas. And, of course, we'll see if Veiga and Kelly make the grade. -- Marcotti",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThese have been an interesting few days in Spanish football around the subject of how we treat our stars, what we expect them to accept, and whether we are properly protecting them. It's a morality tale that includes Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Carlo Ancelotti, Gavi and that will extend to Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, and it emerged on Saturday when Spanish and European champions Real Madrid were surprisingly beaten 1-0 at relegation-threatened Espanyol.\n\nLos Blancos have recently restored one of their most thrilling, most chilling skills: The ability to retrieve possession around their own penalty area and, via no more than three or four passes, be up at the other end of the pitch scoring a dazzling goal somewhere between 14-18 seconds later. It's sporting lightning.\n\nAgainst the blue-and-white club in Barcelona, Ancelotti's team were unleashing one of these extraordinary counter-attacks, with Mbapp\u00e9 in full flight, when the guy who would become the infamous name of the evening lunged wildly at the Frenchman. His name is Carlos Romero and by the end of the match, he'd be enjoying the greatest moment of his short career by virtue of scoring the winner. But in the instant when he thought that Espanyol's world was about to collapse, he attempted the ugliest of fouls to bring Mbapp\u00e9 down, at any cost, by diving, leg-extended, to rake his boot down the back of the forward's calf.\n\nAlthough the referee correctly let the move flow to see whether it ended in advantage or even a goal for Madrid, the absolute requirement was that, immediately after the play stopped, this should merit a red card. Neither the on-pitch referee, nor his companion in the VAR room, considered this a foul worthy of expulsion. It became one of the worst decisions in recent Spanish football.\n\nWhile not sending Romero off was ludicrous, the fact that he was at the back post to volley home a wonderful right-wing cross, thus reducing Madrid to holding just a one-point lead over Atletico going into the derbi this weekend, made things much worse. (Stream LIVE: Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid, Saturday, 2:50 p.m. ET, ESPN+)\n\nRomero's foul on Mbappe was cynical, reckless and could have caused serious harm. Alex Caparros/Getty Images\n\nWorst of all was the refereeing team ignoring that Romero had risked, without any thought of the consequences, severe damage to an opponent -- the kind of damage that the sport's lawmakers, and FIFA as governing body, have sought to exterminate from our game so that players are adequately protected. It's unimaginable how these officials decided that they had no duty of care to Mbapp\u00e9: it flew in the face of everything that those who run football have been trying to preach for the past 30 or 40 years.\n\nFortunately, Madrid's leading scorer is fine, but that's not the point and that's not what the laws say: you can be punished for recklessness and the potential for your actions to cause serious injury.\n\nNot for the first time, I'm totally with Carlo Ancelotti when he spoke with dignity and well-contained fury after the match: \"It was an ugly foul with a big risk of injury and it's also VAR's responsibility to look out for and protect players.\" That was part one of the evidence that emerged as to how we think players can or should be treated or protected.\n\nChapter two came the following day and is far more encouraging. Finally, the clear-cut fact that repeated head trauma has a direct impact on the likelihood of post-career issues such as dementia and Alzheimer's is being taken into account and awareness has grown.\n\nThe incident where Barcelona's Gavi clashed heads badly with the Alav\u00e9s attacker, Tom\u00e1s Conechny, was sickening. It's simple misfortune, but it held the potential to be pretty devastating for both men. It also came against the context of Atletico Madrid treating Robin Le Normand's head injury in October with stringent care. The Spanish international defender suffered a serious concussion, Atleti kept him out of action, observed him, and did not let him play again for 61 days -- a total of 12 missed matches.\n\nBravo to Atletico.\n\nSo, back to Sunday. Gavi's collision with Conechny left him dazed and confused, his fate in the hands of Barcelona's long-term club doctor and his coach, Hansi Flick.\n\nIf you know little of Gavi, let me assure you that he is an absolute warrior who bristles with competitive spirit. What ensued was the traditional picture of an athlete who is so dazed that he can't see the sense in withdrawing from play, instead determined to get back on and get on with work.\n\nThe doctor asks him what day it is, he has no idea. He is able to quote the kickoff time of the match, but it becomes evident he's suffered a bad head trauma. The laudable moment comes when Flick, who is trying to buck the trend of his team losing important matches at home, nevertheless turns to the doctor and says: \"it's your decision\" (i.e. not the player's) and then tries to console Gavi with the concept that he's being protected, and that his well-being is more important than three points.\n\nIt was wonderful to see.\n\nGavi, left, was taken out of Saturday's game after a head injury, with coach Hansi Flick, right, making the right call. It was great to see. JOSEP LAGO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nI admit to a minor personal stake in this argument because my 88-year-old father, a wonderful man who introduced me to sport and all its beauties, was amongst other things, a boxer and a rugby player. We're all pretty certain that the number of times he took blows to the head have helped cause the Alzheimer's from which he suffers quite badly.\n\nIt's also true that over the next few days, I will be attending the funerals of two terrific football men, both of whom mattered very much to me: Jimmy Calderwood, who played in midfield with Louis van Gaal and played against Johan Cruyff, a Scotsman somehow cutting it in Dutch football, and my fellow Aberdonian, Denis Law -- the only Ballon d'Or winner Scotland has ever produced, a wonderful man, a prodigious header of the football, and also somebody, like Calderwood, whose death was principally caused by Alzheimers. Sadly, it's too late for them, but we all share the responsibility to ensure that current generations are properly protected, that we learn the lessons which were ignored in previous decades so that the people who now thrill and delight us remain of sound mind right through to their latter years.\n\nProgress in protecting talented players from foul play, as the referees showed when Espa\u00f1ol beat Real Madrid, can be made, but then abandoned or undermined. Progress, as clubs and referees have shown in the case of footballers with concussions or victims of racial abuse needing protection, can be become the norm.\n\nAll of this, I believe, has echoes of the constant battle against racism in sport. All of us -- from legislators to fans, sponsors, clubs, players, managers and the media -- have a responsibility to continue reporting, informing and confronting such abuse. The initiatives to protect players from physical damage on the pitch, whether from deliberate foul tackling or head clashes, are positive, but the past few days have shown that such progress can be interrupted.\n\nFor those of us committed to improving the way players are treated, thought about, talked about and protected, I believe these have been informative incidents. It's an imperfect, frustrating and often slow battle, but one that's worth our effort.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nFor Europe's biggest clubs and leagues, the time for transfers in the 2024-25 season has come and gone.\n\nThe winter window closed at 11 p.m. BST (6 p.m. ET) in England, Italy and Spain on Monday, an hour earlier in France and even earlier in Germany. It remains open in select countries such as Turkey and the Netherlands, but there's little room for more major deals.\n\nAll parties -- clubs, players, managers and agents -- will now sit back and assess. Some got their wishes and some didn't. Some excelled in their movements over the summer, while others will be lamenting missed opportunities.\n\nWith that, let's look back at what happened during the window and neatly sort the results into winners and losers (with a few who sit in between). Here's who nailed it -- and who didn't.\n\nWINNERS\n\nThere is no doubting who won this window, as PSG landed one of the world's best wingers -- Khvicha Kvaratskhelia -- for a fee of just \u20ac60 million. The Georgia international's transfer was being valued at double that just a few months ago, so they really pulled off a coup and \"Kvaradona\" should have a major impact.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the French champions also made a cool \u20ac46m profit on midfielder Xavi Simons' permanent switch to RB Leipzig for \u20ac50m, moved on defender Cher Ndour to Fiorentina, and also found a home for misfiring forward Randal Kolo Muani, who was sent on loan to Juventus for the rest of the season.\n\nAston Villa were among the busiest clubs in Europe during this window and in one fell swoop, they were able to solve all of their profit and sustainability rules (PSR) issues.\n\nA \u20ac77m move to Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr for 21-year-old striker Jhon Dur\u00e1n will aid the club's finances for years, and they did well to find permanent homes for Jaden Philogene (Ipswich Town) and Diego Carlos (Fenerbah\u00e7e), as well as loans for Emiliano Buend\u00eda (Bayer Leverkusen), Kosta Nedeljkovic (RB Leipzig) and Samuel Iling-Junior (Middlesbrough).\n\nMarcus Rashford (on loan from Man United) will replace Dur\u00e1n with the hope of reigniting his career, and Donyell Malen (\u20ac25m, Borussia Dortmund) should provide another option up front. The late loan move for PSG's Marco Asensio is another low-risk, high-reward arrival to help Villa push forward on multiple fronts between now and the end of the season.\n\nA more experienced right-back than Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda (\u20ac8m, Levante) might have been on the cards, but it was the loan signing of Chelsea centre-back Axel Disasi that tipped Villa over into winners. If they hadn't signed someone to plug the gaps in their defence, it would have been bad.\n\nplay 2:09 How Marcus Rashford can prove that he wasn't the problem at Manchester United Mark Ogden breaks down Marcus Rashford's loan move to Aston Villa from his boyhood club Manchester United.\n\nMARCUS RASHFORD\n\nRashford had not featured for Man United since their Europa League win over Viktoria Plzen on Dec. 12 amid new head coach Ruben Amorim's concerns about the forward's application in training. And it will be a relief for him to have found a new club.\n\nAC Milan, Dortmund and Barcelona were all in the running at various points, but Villa managed to persuade Rashford to join and also agreed to cover a substantial part of his wages (which is why United allowed him to go).\n\nRashford will have a lot to prove for the rest of the season, and what he does could very well define the rest of his career. For now, he'll just be delighted to be out of Old Trafford.\n\nDANI OLMO\n\nThe fact that he can even play for Barcelona makes Dani Olmo a winner. At the start of January, it looked very much as if Barca's \u20ac60m summer signing would be kicking his heels on the sidelines for the second half of the season, as the club's financial issues prevented him from being registered with LaLiga.\n\nBut one court battle after another followed, and as it stands, the Spain forward can play for now -- though LaLiga chief Javier Tebas is trying to change that.\n\nOtherwise, it's a bit of a sorry tale for Barcelona, who missed signing Rashford on loan and didn't move out Pau V\u00edctor, Eric Garc\u00eda, Pablo Torre or Ansu Fati on loan.\n\nNEUTRAL\n\nplay 1:25 Laurens: Man City should've had Nico Gonz\u00e1lez in on January 1st Julien Laurens looks at new Manchester City midfielder Nico Gonz\u00e1lez and explains why Pep Guardiola needed him a month ago.\n\nOn the face of it, spending over \u20ac200m to sign four players should qualify Man City as winners, right? Well, the problem is that while struggling City definitely needed an injection of new blood this window, the players they signed aren't a great solution to their immediate issues.\n\nYoung defenders Abdukodir Khusanov (\u20ac48m, Lens) and Vitor Reis (\u20ac35m, Palmeiras) aren't really yet ready for the pace of the Premier League, though they can fill some of the gaps left by City's injuries. Up front, the club spent \u20ac60m (plus another \u20ac10m in add-ons) to sign in-form striker Omar Marmoush from Eintracht Frankfurt, but they are playing him out of position as a withdrawn striker (basically a No. 10) rather than as a No. 9 or out wide on the left where he would be more comfortable.\n\nThe only obvious fit was the signing of former Barcelona defensive midfielder Nico Gonzalez from FC Porto and even then, City were forced to fork over an extra \u20ac20m than what they wanted to, paying his \u20ac60m release clause.\n\nIt could be that it takes another year or so before these signings can be properly judged, but right now it doesn't feel as if they are the answer.\n\nplay 1:50 Laurens: Postecoglou changed Tel's mind after initial Spurs rejection Julien Laurens explains how a chat with Ange Postecoglou made Mathys Tel change his mind and accept a loan move to Tottenham.\n\nTottenham are in the middle of an injury crisis, especially in defence, and manager Ange Postecoglou was pretty vocal about needing some reinforcements if they are to move up from 14th place in the table in the second part of the season.\n\nThe loan signing of centre-back Kevin Danso (with an obligatory \u20ac25m deal set for the summer) will bolster them slightly, but an offer of \u20ac75m to land Crystal Palace's Marc Gu\u00e9hi, which was rejected, showed how much the club wanted to do. And they failed to add more cover.\n\nThey needed a backup goalkeeper and 21-year-old Antonin Kinsky hit the ground running as he was thrown into action from the off, but 18-year-old South Korea prodigy Yang Min-Hyeok, who was then sent on loan to QPR, wasn't going to be enough in attacking areas.\n\nSo, tipping them from losers to neutral was the deadline-day signing of Bayern forward Mathys Tel on loan, with an option to sign permanently in the summer. The club did well to persuade him to join, given he rejected a \u20ac60m permanent move last week, and he could make an immediate difference in attack.\n\nThis one is more about who the club were able to keep hold of rather than who they signed. Teenage arrivals Matai Akinmboni, Julio Soler, Kai Crampton and Zain Silcott-Duberry might not immediately make an impact as they are ones for the future, but Bournemouth will be delighted to have kept hold of their main stars as they push for a spot in Europe this season.\n\nWhile loan exits for Philip Billing (Napoli) and Max Aarons (Valencia) were sanctioned, Bournemouth kept hold of Milos Kerkez, Illia Zabarnyi and Dean Huijsen -- all of whom were attracting interest from some of the biggest clubs in Europe. That is no mean feat.\n\nLOSERS\n\nplay 1:39 Ogden: PSR may trump Amorim over Garnacho future Mark Ogden believes Ruben Amorim wants Alejandro Garnacho to stay at Manchester United however the board are open to selling the forward.\n\nWill a 20-year-old full-back solve all of Man United's issues? The club did well to land highly rated Patrick Dorgu for \u20ac30m from Lecce and he is a good fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation, but they really needed more.\n\nLoan exits for Antony (Real Betis), Rashford (Aston Villa) and Tyrell Malacia (PSV) opened up room on the wage bill, but the signing of 18-year-old defender Ayden Heaven from Arsenal was not going to set pulses racing at Old Trafford. A goal-scoring forward was needed, while a serious injury to Lisandro Martinez could see them regret not adding more to their defensive ranks.\n\nArsenal are the second-highest scorers in the Premier League, but they still needed to sign another forward player if they want to challenge Liverpool for the title. Kai Havertz has done OK, with 15 goals in all competitions to date, but injuries to Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus have left the squad short of options up front and that's not going to change now.\n\nplay 2:26 Marcotti: Arsenal title hopes rest on Havertz fitness Gabriele Marcotti believes Arsenal's titles hopes are very dependent on keeping Kai Havertz fit for the rest of the season.\n\nA \u00a340m bid to sign Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was rejected, while links to Bayern's Tel, Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Athletic Club's Nico Williams came to nothing.\n\nThe club also lost young defender Heaven to Man United for minimal compensation, which they would not have liked.\n\nAn odd window for the usually free-spending Blues, as 19-year-old midfielder Mathis Amougou (\u20ac15m from Saint-Etienne) and Trevoh Chalobah were the only incomings and the latter was a loan recall from Crystal Palace. Links with Man United's Alejandro Garnacho came to nothing and Chelsea were rumored to be interested in almost every central striker around but didn't sign one.\n\nOut went young midfielder Cesare Casadei to Torino, where they got back the \u20ac15m they paid to sign him from Internazionale in 2022, and there were a number of loan deals for the likes of Renato Veiga (Juventus), Ben Chilwell (Crystal Palace) and Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix (AC Milan). Do they feel any better off? Not really.\n\nCHRISTOPHER NKUNKU\n\nSources told ESPN ahead of deadline day that Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku was desperate to leave after playing just 419 minutes in the Premier League so far this season. But when the deadline passed, the France international was still there.\n\nInterest from Bayern Munich and Manchester United came to nothing, as the Blues reportedly wanted at least \u20ac60m for a permanent transfer and it's surprising that he didn't move out on loan in the end. Though it seems neither the player nor club were interested in a short-term deal.\n\nIt remains to be seen what part he will play in the rest of the season, but a summer move is almost certainly on the cards.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nA record $15.6 million was spent on international women's football transfers in 2024, according to the latest FIFA report, more than doubling the previous mark set in 2023. And we even had a new world-record fee ($1.1m) as USWNT defender Naomi Girma moved to Chelsea.\n\nHere are grades for all the major January transfers in the women's game, with each listed in order of date and then highest fee.\n\nAll fees are reported unless confirmed with an asterisk.\n\nJan. 30\n\nKeira Walsh\n\n\u20ac550,000 (\u00a3460,000, $572,000)\n\nBarcelona: D+\n\nChelsea: A\n\nWalsh might not be quite the force she was when she secured a world-record \u20ac400,000 move to Barcelona in the summer of 2022 but she still remains one of the best midfielders in world football and is one of a select group of players who can make this Chelsea team better. Sonia Bompastor's side have had a fruitful January transfer window and the prospect of them sealing a sixth consecutive WSL title now seems almost inevitable, with all the team's main problem areas having now been addressed.\n\nFrom a Barcelona perspective, Walsh's departure is a blow, but it's hefty fee given she was out of contract in the summer. The 27-year-old has started 15 of the Spanish club's 22 games so far this term and is a valuable member of the squad, in terms of both the experience and quality she brings. Not only have Barcelona lost a talented player, they have simultaneously strengthened probably their biggest rivals for the Champions League this season. It will certainly be interesting if the two clubs meet in the final. - BL\n\nJenna Nighswonger\n\n\u00a380,200 ($100,000)\n\nGotham FC: C\n\nArsenal: B\n\nYou don't earn 18 caps for the United States without being a very good player and that is why Nighswonger is a very shrewd addition for Arsenal. At 24, the left-back already has a wealth of experience at the elite level, having been part of the squad that won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer. With Steph Catley now playing more frequently as a centre-back, Arsenal needed depth at left-back, and Nighswonger's arrival will allow Republic of Ireland international Katie McCabe to be rotated or pushed higher up the pitch. She's not a transformational signing, but she should add plenty of quality to the squad.\n\nFrom a Gotham perspective, losing a U.S. international just as she is approaching her prime years is a blow. However, the club are used to navigating a relatively high turnover of players and will likely feel they can find an adequate replacement before the NWSL season starts in March. -- BL\n\nChloe Kelly\n\nLoan\n\nManchester City: C\n\nArsenal: B+\n\nIt has been one of the biggest sagas of the January window. Twelve months ago, the idea of Kelly leaving Manchester City to join Arsenal would have been inconceivable. Now, though, it's reality.\n\nFrom an Arsenal point of view, it's a smart addition. Kelly hasn't been at her best for some time now, but she's still a player with enormous quality and, in the right environment, could thrive. The fact she has only signed on loan makes it a relatively risk-free transfer for Renee Slegers' side and she offers them another dangerous attacking option.\n\nFrom City's perspective, the nature of Kelly's exit leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. She might not have featured prominently this season but she is still a top player, and losing her to a direct rival after the player released a very honest statement about her situation on social media is a blow. -- BL\n\nLaura Wienroither\n\nLoan\n\nArsenal: B\n\nManchester City: B\n\nIt's been a tough couple of years for Wienroither. After sustaining an ACL injury in May 2023, the full-back has found it difficult to break back into the Arsenal team, with U.S. international Emily Fox having joined the club in the interim. With that in mind, it always felt as if Wienroither would have to move elsewhere to find the minutes she requires, having featured only three times in all competitions for Arsenal this season.\n\nOn the face of it, her loan move is a deal which suits all parties. For City, Wienroither provides depth in a crucial area and, if she is able to get back to her best, she will add plenty of quality and experience to the squad. The emergence of academy talent Katie Reid means Arsenal do have cover for Fox if they need it, so Wienroither's exit is not too much of problem. -- BL\n\nJan. 26\n\nNaomi Girma\n\n\u00a3881,000 ($1.1m)\n\nSan Diego Wave: B-\n\nChelsea: A+\n\nIt has happened! The first $1m signing in the women's football is USWNT defender Naomi Girma. Chelsea were willing to pay the largest-ever fee to sign the defender along with the high wages that come with signing such a big name. It is surprising, though, that it is a defender who broke the world record. The past three deals to do so (Racheal Kundananji, Mayra Ramirez and Keira Walsh) were either forwards or midfielders, but this just highlights a lack of world-class defenders, meaning top clubs like Lyon and Chelsea were willing to pay the big bucks to sign one. She is arguably the best centre-back around currently.\n\nFor Chelsea, the signing only strengthens an already stacked squad but comes at a crucial time with the side on course for the Quadruple. With the Wave now under the new leadership of Jonas Eidevall, it did seem surprising that the San Diego club were willing to let their premier defender go. After losing star forward Jaedyn Shaw, too, the Wave are in a transition period and as general manager Camille Ashton told ESPN, this is a time for the club to \"reshape and to build.\" -- EK\n\nplay 1:12 USWNT teammates react to Naomi Girma's record Chelsea move Cat Macario and Emily Fox react to their USWNT teammate Naomi Girma's record transfer to Chelsea following the Blues' 1-0 win over Arsenal.\n\nJan. 21\n\nKerolin\n\nUndisclosed\n\nNC Courage: B-\n\nMan City: A\n\nKerolin, the 2023 NWSL MVP, is set to inject flair into City's forward line at a crucial moment, especially with Lauren Hemp sidelined due to injury. The Brazilian's arrival comes at an ideal time, as winger Chloe Kelly is expected to leave at the end of her contract in the summer-or potentially on loan during the January window. By securing Kerolin, manager Gareth Taylor is strategically bolstering his options in wide attacking positions in the present and thinking for the future.\n\nKerolin's talent has caught the attention of top WSL clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal previously, which was why City were eager to secure her signature. Previously a key player for NC Courage, Kerolin's absence due to an ACL injury last year was a major blow, but since her return in September, the team has adapted well, softening the impact of her loss. -- EK\n\nAlanna Kennedy\n\nUndisclosed\n\nMan City: B-\n\nAngel City: B\n\nIt seems like a strange move for Manchester City to let defender Kennedy depart while Alex Greenwood is still ruled out with a knee injury, leaving their options for centre-back dangerously thin. They have already signed one central defender, and it would be silly to assume Gareth Taylor would not look at a second option to bolster the defence.\n\nKennedy had spells of time confined to the bench, but without Greenwood available, there seemed no better time for the Australian to gather momentum and playing time than now.\n\nIt is a positive addition for Angel City, who finished 12 in the NWSL table last season and conceded the second most goals, 42, during the 2024 campaign. -- EK\n\nJan. 18\n\nKatherine Kuhl\n\nUndisclosed\n\nArsenal: C-\n\nRoma: A\n\nThe Gunners signed Kuhl to be the next big thing two years ago, and after being a vital edition during Arsenal's injury crisis at the end of 2022-23, hopes were high for the youngster's future. But after struggling for game-time last season, she was sent on loan for the remainder of the campaign to Everton. Still, despite positive praise and minutes with the Merseyside club, she returned to north London and was confined to the bench, claiming just six minutes from the first sector.\n\nIt is not a surprise, given the fact that the Gunners have a plethora of midfield options, that Kuhl departed for a chance to play more game time, however, it is a worrying pattern for Arsenal, who have failed to integrate a crop of academy youngsters for several years and failed to build up their acquired young talent. Summer signing Rosa Kafaji is in a similar position, making only one start this season thus far.\n\nIt is a great deal for Roma, who could use some extra talent to bolster their battle against Juventus for the title, and could extend their chances of reaching the Champions League again next season. -- EK\n\nAemu Oyama\n\nUndisclosed\n\nWaseda University: B\n\nMan City: A\n\nCity are in the midst of an injury crisis and need as many signings as they can to bolster the team and add depth. Manager Gareth Taylor has attracted several young talents, especially from Japan, and harnessed their technical ability to advance his side.\n\nOyama is the fifth Japan international to sign for City in the past three years. Summer signing Aoba Fujino, 20, has improved the club's creativity but has not produced as many goals as desired, so 20-year-old midfielder Oyama should add attacking depth. -- EK\n\nJan. 15\n\nLize Kop\n\nUndisclosed\n\nLeicester City: C\n\nSpurs: B+\n\nLeicester are stuck at the bottom of the table, one point shy of the relegation zone and have struggled with injuries this season. But despite their standing, their defensive record is not that bad, only conceding 13 goals this season, so letting go of a goalkeeper with Kop's potential is interesting, given how heavily Leicester have relied on the Netherlands international to rotate with Janina Leitzig.\n\nSpurs were in desperate need of reinforcements after Barbara Votikova departed after one season. Becky Spencer has been a stalwart between the sticks, but she is now 33 years old, meaning the club need to look to bring in their future No. 1 to learn under her guidance. Kop has potential, as she is only 26, but is already a top class goalkeeper. -- EK\n\nJan. 9\n\nMarta\n\nFree\n\nOrlando Pride: A\n\nIn what might be one of the biggest twists of this transfer window, free agent (her Orlando contract expired at the end of 2024) Marta signed a new two-year deal with the NWSL champions, keeping her at the club until 2026.\n\nMarta, who is 39 next month, helped the Pride to their first title and won a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics with Brazil. So it is a big deal for Orlando to retain the one of the world's most iconic players. -- EK\n\nJulia Bartel\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: A\n\nLiverpool: A\n\nWhen Bartel signed for Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer, it very much felt like she was a player for the future. At just 20 years old, it was always going to be difficult for the midfielder to break straight into the Chelsea first team and so it has proven. She had made just two appearances for Sonia Bompastor's side this term, totalling 25 minutes. She's likely to get ample playing time on Merseyside and should return to Cobham in the summer as a more seasoned player.\n\nFor Liverpool, this is another shrewd acquisition. Manager Matt Beard has spoken about funds being limited at the club and bringing in Bartel, as well as Bayern Munich loanee Sam Kerr, should add some extra quality in the middle of the park. Though Bartel is young, she has extensive experience from her time with Barcelona's B team as well as from youth international football with Spain, winning the U20 Women's World Cup in 2022 and the U19 Women's European Championship on two occasions. -- BL\n\nJan. 8\n\nHayley Ladd\n\nUndisclosed\n\nMan United: B-\n\nEverton: A\n\nLadd's Manchester United exit has felt inevitable for some time now. The Wales international has made just three WSL appearances so far this term, with United boss Marc Skinner having bolstered his midfield in the summer transfer window. With Euro 2025 coming up in the summer, Ladd's need for minutes means her move to Everton makes a lot of sense.\n\nHer departure leaves United a little bit light in the middle of the park, which could come back to haunt them as they bid to secure Champions League qualification. But, for Everton, Ladd's arrival is a continuation of some shrewd January business, with the 31-year-old bringing plenty of quality and experience to Walton Hall Park. -- BL\n\nSam Kerr\n\nLoan\n\nBayern Munich: B\n\nLiverpool: A+\n\nLiverpool manager Matt Beard tried to sign Kerr two years ago, but has finally landed the Scotland international. Kerr, 25, not to be mistaken for namesake Australia international and Chelsea forward Sam Kerr, signed for Bayern in 2023 but has struggled for game time, only making two starts so far. She has found it tough to break into Alexander Straus' star-studded lineup, so a loan is the right option for both club and player. However, Bayern fans will be concerned that any further injuries could leave options a little light.\n\nFor Liverpool, Beard admitted that they are probably getting a more advanced player following her 18-month stint with the German champions, making it a perfect signing at the right time for the Merseyside team. Beard admitted before the winter break that he had a limited budget in this window, but if this loan spell is successful they may look to make a permanent offer. -- EK\n\nJan. 7\n\nEmma Watson\n\nLoan\n\nMan United: B\n\nEverton: A\n\nAfter suffering an ACL injury early in her Manchester United career, the Scotland international talent is set to make the most of a fresh opportunity to play. While Watson impressed in a brief appearance for United in the League Cup, she has struggled to secure a regular spot in the starting XI following her recovery. With Marc Skinner's lack of rotation, a loan move makes sense for the club.\n\nIn addition to Watson's departure, United have also loaned out fellow young talent Jess Simpson to Bristol City, ensuring both players have the opportunity to gain valuable playing time and continue their development.\n\nEverton have long been adept at leveraging the loan system to strengthen their squad, and this move is no exception. Despite the backing of the Friedkin Group, Everton's budget still lags behind that of the top clubs, but the loan market allows them to maximise their resources and reinforce a team that have struggled with injuries. -- EK\n\nJan. 4\n\nMartina Fernandez\n\nLoan\n\nBarcelona: A\n\nEverton: A\n\nNot only is this a great signing for a club like Everton, who know how to get the best out of budding young talents, but it is mutually beneficial for her parent club, Barcelona.\n\nFollowing comments from players like Aitana Bonmati -- explaining how Liga F needs to do more to raise the stakes and competitiveness of the league -- it is no surprise that Barcelona are starting to send handfuls of their up-and-coming youngsters to England and other top leagues to gain experience.\n\nFernandez, 20, is following the path to gain vital playing time and experience, making it a perfect signing for both clubs, especially Barcelona, as she would not have had the same opportunities in the B side. -- EK\n\nJan. 3\n\nOlivia Holdt\n\nUndisclosed\n\nRosengard: B-\n\nSpurs: A\n\nRosengard are losing plenty of talent in this window, already saying goodbye to two players who helped steer them to the Swedish league. This happened to Hammarby in the summer and is a plot fall of the Damallsvenskan acting as a feeder for more established clubs in Europe.\n\nBut it's a positive move for the youngster who has started to become integrated into Denmark's national team and fills a gap in Spurs' midfield. The club have struggled to rejig the side following Grace Clinton's departure back to Man United and the losses of Maite Oroz and Kit Graham. While the former is expected to return for the second half of the season, Holdt will be a key addition as coach Robert Vilahamn looks to solidify their mid-table stance. -- EK\n\nJan. 1\n\nRebecca Knaak\n\nLoan\n\nRosengard: C\n\nMan City: A-\n\nMan City were in engulfed in an injury crisis in the latter part of last year, losing Risa Shimizu, Lauren Hemp, Khadija \"Bunny\" Shaw, Naomi Layzel, Vivianne Miedema and Alex Greenwood. The side desperately need reinforcements, especially in defence with Greenwood set to be sidelined for several months. Knaak is experienced in Germany and Sweden, so will bring a level of composure, but she is uncapped for the senior national team. Despite this, she helped to steer Rosengard to the Swedish league in November and knows what it takes to win.\n\nDespite being a defender, she netted 16 goals in 36 appearances and clearly caught the eye of City's new Head of Women's of Football, Therese Sj\u00f6gran, formerly of Rosengard as a player and director. City need to rebuild if they want to keep pressure on Chelsea at the top of the table and Knaak will prove key in bolstering the back line. -- EK\n\nKelly Gago\n\nUndisclosed\n\nNantes: B\n\nEverton: A\n\nEverton's budget has improved significantly after the Friedkin Group takeover, allowing them to sign Gago. The Toffees have struggled with injuries since last season, including ACL's to Aurora Galli and Inma Gabrarro. Sitting 12th in the table, they need points to avoid relegation and are especially lacking in goals, with the third-lowest tally in the league.\n\nGago, a 25-year-old forward with solid experience in mid-table European clubs, including 44 goals in 88 appearances for AS Saint-\u00c9tienne, is a positive signing to bolster the side. Recently called up to the France national team, she'll get a bigger platform and a more competitive league at Everton to showcase her talent. -- EK",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMathys Tel has joined Tottenham Hotspur on loan from Bayern Munich. Tottenham Hotspur\n\nPremier League clubs increased their spending in this winter window to \u00a3370m -- up on the \u00a3100m paid out last year -- though Manchester City are chiefly responsible after splashing out \u00a3180m of that on their own.\n\nWe were nowhere near the 2023 record of \u00a3815m, but there were still some interesting deals around Europe.\n\nHere are grades for all the major confirmed transfers in the men's game, with each listed by date and then by highest fee.\n\nAll fees are reported unless confirmed with an asterisk.\n\nFeb. 3\n\nFC Porto: A+\n\nManchester City: B-\n\nAs usual, Porto showed why they are one of the kings of the transfer market. An \u20ac8.5m signing from Barcelona back in 2023, Gonz\u00e1lez has been moved on to City for a huge profit -- although Barcelona are due a large portion of the fee. No matter though; Porto will just do this all again with his replacement.\n\nMan City needed a midfielder but only valued Gonz\u00e1lez's transfer at \u20ac40m before they eventually relented on deadline day to pay his \u20ac60m release clause. The 23-year-old is a good addition, who knows how to play in the style of a Pep Guardiola team, but it does feel like a bit of a panic move from City.\n\nFeyenoord: B\n\nAC Milan: B\n\nGim\u00e9nez notched goals for fun at Feyenoord, his strike rate better than one-in-two games over the course of 2 1/2 seasons at De Kuip. He's scored reliably in the Eredivisie, Europa League and Champions League and, at age 23, the time feels right for a big move.\n\nAC Milan have gambled that he can take the big step up from the Netherlands, but even if the goal scoring doesn't come straight away, they can benefit from Gim\u00e9nez's other positive traits: He's a force in the air, a willing presser and a strong back-to-goal link player.\n\nN\u00fcrnberg: B\n\nBrighton: B\n\nTzimas has enjoyed a breakout season in the German second tier, scoring 10 goals from just 13 starts for N\u00fcrnberg. Brighton manager Fabian H\u00fcrzeler has called him an \"out-and-out centre-forward with a natural ability to score goals\" -- an assessment that's easy to agree with when you watch him chip the goalkeeper and finish off one-vs.-ones over and over.\n\nAt just 19 years of age he's certainly one for the future, a fact made clear by the fact he'll stay at N\u00fcrnberg on loan for the remainder of the campaign. On paper this looks like a huge fee for the German outfit, but the context is that they've paid \u20ac19m to sign him from PAOK, then move him on for \u20ac24m.\n\nMATHYS TEL\n\nLoan\n\nBayern Munich: B\n\nTottenham Hotspur: A\n\nBayern needed to get Tel some playing time and while they were willing to accept a \u20ac60m permanent offer from Tottenham, a loan deal with a \u20ac55m summer option will suffice.\n\nSpurs deserve credit for not giving up when the 19-year-old first rejected their advances amid interest from Manchester United and Chelsea, among others. Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou needed some depth up front and Tel is incredibly versatile and should be able to provide cover in a number of positions. A loan is a low-risk move and Spurs have landed one of the top youngsters in Europe.\n\nplay 1:04 What are Tottenham getting with Mathys Tel signing? Julien Laurens explains why he thinks of new Spurs signing Mathys Tel as the \"complete package\" when it comes to forwards.\n\nJOAO FELIX\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: C-\n\nMilan: B+\n\nAnother Chelsea player who was signed for around \u20ac50m and is now being sent out on loan. If the plan is to eventually recoup that fee, Felix is going to have to play very well at San Siro to attract another suitor, as Milan don't have an option to sign him permanently.\n\nNone of this is Milan's problem, though. They'll simply be delighted to borrow him for the second half of the season as they look to burst back into the Serie A top four.\n\nBEN CHILWELL\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: B\n\nCrystal Palace: B\n\nIt's been about 10 months since Chilwell started a game of competitive football and, after being completely frozen out by Blues boss Enzo Maresca this season, it's impossible to know what Palace are going to get here. At his best, Chilwell was a top-quality Premier League left-back -- but how close is he to that level now?\n\nChelsea have made it clear they don't want him, so having some of his wages covered while giving him a chance to rebuild his career is useful. Chilwell will just want to play. And perhaps Palace have one eye on the future here, given current left-back Tyrick Mitchell's contract is expiring in the summer?\n\nMARCO ASENSIO\n\nLoan\n\nPSG: B\n\nAston Villa: B-\n\nAsensio represents an injection of quality at a time of need for Villa. They've found themselves lacking an alternative to Morgan Rogers in the final third at times and were a man light in this area after loaning Emiliano Buend\u00eda out to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe Spain international has fallen by the wayside a little in a PSG squad stacked with options, so they've allowed him out on loan so long as his wages are covered. This is the very definition of a quick fix for all involved, it has the potential to work out brilliantly. But it does rely on Asensio regaining his mojo.\n\nCARNEY CHUKWUEMEKA\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: B\n\nBorussia Dortmund: A\n\nWithout much chance of breaking into the Chelsea first XI this season, a loan was required as Chukwuemeka looks to prove why he is considered such a top prospect. The key for Chelsea will be how much he plays, so they can make an informed decision on his future in the summer.\n\nDortmund have a history of turning young English players into megastars. The Bundesliga could be the perfect environment for him to shine, even if only for six months.\n\nAXEL DISASI\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: C+\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nHaving spent \u20ac45m to sign him from AS Monaco in 2023, the fact that Chelsea need to send Disasi out on loan isn't great. But perhaps a loan to another Premier League club is just what he needs to get his career back on track?\n\nAston Villa certainly needed some reinforcements at the back, and while the 26-year-old probably wasn't their first choice, a loan is a relatively low-risk move and he can cover in a number of positions.\n\nplay 1:56 Echegaray: Disasi caps off 'ambitious and aggressive' Aston Villa window Luis Miguel Echegaray reacts to a big transfer window for Aston Villa, completed with a loan deal for defender Axel Disasi from Chelsea.\n\nEVAN FERGUSON\n\nLoan\n\nBrighton: B\n\nWest Ham: A\n\nIt was reported that Ferguson would be available on loan well before the window opened, so it's been a surprise to see it take 33 days for a move to come to fruition. At least, he's now found a snug fit with Graham Potter at West Ham, the manager who oversaw his explosion onto the scene a couple of years ago.\n\nFrom Brighton's perspective, this is yet another example of a club loaning out a player whose stock is artificially low, in the hope he'll perform and boost his market value ahead of the summer. West Ham are absolutely desperate for a No. 9 striker, so there's no doubt he'll get ample playing time.\n\nLLOYD KELLY\n\nLoan\n\nNewcastle: A+\n\nJuventus: C\n\nThis is possibly the weirdest transfer of the window -- with a \u20ac24m (\u00a319.9m, $24.5m) obligation to sign him permanently in the summer. It does make some sense, but it's just so random and unexpected, it makes you pause for thought.\n\nSigned on a free transfer last summer, Kelly struggled to make an impact for Newcastle this season, despite the fact he knew manager Eddie Howe very well from their time at AFC Bournemouth together. He made just six starts in all competitions. Now he's moved to Juventus.\n\nWe know the Old Lady have been desperate for defensive depth this window, so perhaps this is just the reality of a Deadline Day scramble: Not the transfer you set out to make on Jan. 1, but interesting all the same.\n\nFeb. 2\n\nLecce: A+\n\nManchester United: B\n\nSigning Dorgu helps Manchester United tick short and long-term targets in one go: At 20, he clearly falls in line with their focus on recruiting young players with potential; while he also plays in their No. 1 position of need right now: left-wing-back.\n\nIt's important to recognise that Dorgu is still very early in his development and is no immediate fix to this team, but there have been moments at Lecce where he's looked a bit like an early version of Destiny Udogie in the way he carries the ball, which is no doubt something worth attempting to harness.\n\nThis is a club-record transfer for Lecce, surpassing the previous high by over \u20ac10m, and given they signed him for \u20ac200,000 just 18 months ago, it goes down as a phenomenal deal for them.\n\nChelsea: D\n\nTorino: A\n\nA genuine star at youth level for Italy in two summer tournaments, there's justifiable excitement over Casadei's potential -- but his 2\u00bd years at Stamford Bridge ultimately feel like a waste, having appeared just 17 times for the club and clocking a miserly 71 Premier League minutes.\n\nChelsea get a poor grade, as they've ultimately received about \u20ac10m less than their original asking price, but Torino get a great one, as they represent a great spot for Casadei to get his career back and they haven't paid much to make it happen.\n\nMARCUS RASHFORD\n\nLoan\n\nManchester United: A\n\nAston Villa: B-\n\nOn first glance, this transfer smacks of desperation from all sides, but upon closer inspection, it makes some semblance of sense -- even with a \u00a340m ($49.6m) option at the end of his loan.\n\nIt became clear early in January that a loan was the only realistic way out of Old Trafford for Rashford. From that point, it was all about how much of his reported \u00a3325,000-a-week wage Manchester United could get someone to cover, and they'll be delighted that Villa have agreed to pay 75% of it.\n\nThat means Villa will pay about \u00a35m to borrow Rashford until the end of the season, which is probably a better strategy than entering the striker market late and overpaying for an Ollie Watkins backup. Unai Emery excels at \"fixing\" players, so this is one of the best managers for Rashford to go play for, too.\n\nplay 2:09 How Marcus Rashford can prove that he wasn't the problem at Manchester United Mark Ogden breaks down Marcus Rashford's loan move to Aston Villa from his boyhood club Manchester United.\n\nKEVIN DANSO\n\nLoan\n\nLens: B\n\nTottenham Hotspur: B\n\nDanso follows Abdukodir Khusanov and Brice Samba out the door at RC Lens, meaning the club have move on their entire defensive spine in this window. You don't see that very often!\n\nAn obligation to sign Danso for \u20ac25m in the summer seems like a fair fee all round. He's an international calibre centre-back who played well for Austria during Euro 2024, a good athlete who boasts good speed and strength, and he whips the odd good long pass out too. It's a solid pickup -- the only knock is it took Spurs far too long to spring into action this month.\n\nJan. 31\n\nNEYMAR\n\nFree\n\nSantos: A\n\nNeymar's return to boyhood club Santos is a heartwarming one, given the nightmare 15 months from which he's just emerging. An ACL tear in October 2023 meant he only ended up playing seven games for his previous club, Al Hilal, despite costing $94m in transfer fees and another $161m per year in wages.\n\nAt 32 years of age, off the back of not only a severe injury but also an entire career of being kicked and fouled, it's impossible to know what's left in the tank. Will Neymar light up the Brazilian Serie A once again, or is this another Eden Hazard to Real Madrid situation? At the very least, Santos understand the risk involved, so Neymar has reportedly agreed to a very modest monthly basic wage of approximately $42,000 a week.\n\n\u20ac77m (\u00a364.4m; $80.1m)\n\nAston Villa: A\n\nAl Nassr: B\n\nDur\u00e1n's two years in the Premier League were a whirlwind. He developed from a chaotic super-sub to a genuine first-team option, scoring some wicked, brilliant goals along the way. But his incompatibility with fellow striker Ollie Watkins meant a decision point had been reached: One had to go.\n\nDur\u00e1n is talented and could go on to become incredible, but the huge fee involved -- \u20ac77m, potentially rising to \u20ac90m -- made it a no-brainer for Villa; any lingering issues with PSR are now well and truly behind them.\n\nAl Nassr have paid a premium for the man of the moment, but will at least be happy to future-proof their attack beyond Cristiano Ronaldo while continuing to lower the average age of Saudi Pro League signings in the process.\n\nMARIO HERMOSO\n\nLoan\n\nRoma: B\n\nBayer Leverkusen: A\n\nHermoso was one of last summer's prized free agents, so to see him move on from Roma so quickly will surprise some, but clearly things haven't worked out so far (the Giallorossi being on their third manager of the season already may have something to do with that).\n\nLeverkusen found themselves in need of some defensive depth following Jean\u00fcel Belocian's ACL tear earlier this month, so Xabi Alonso will likely be delighted to add such an experienced, hardened -- and in the right circumstances, talented -- player to the fold. He's a great fit to cover the left-centre-back role in the back three, as he played plenty of that during his time at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\n\nJan. 30\n\nPSG: A\n\nRB Leipzig: C+\n\nAt face value, this looks like a fine deal for RB Leipzig: \u20ac50m to sign an excellent young player who has spent the last 18 months with them on loan feels like a fair risk/reward balance. But there's a couple of extra reported details that intrigue: First, add-ons of \u20ac30m could take this up to a whopping \u20ac80m; and second, he's only signed a contract until 2027. That's not normal for such a transfer, where such a big fee is involved. It suggests that Simons may well be on the move again in the not-too-distant future-especially if Leipzig fail to make the Champions League for 2025-26.\n\nPSG, meanwhile, receive a huge sum for a player they've barely ever considered for the first team.\n\nJan. 29\n\nEMILIANO BUENDIA\n\nLoan\n\nAston Villa: B\n\nBayer Leverkusen: B\n\nBuend\u00eda is yet to start a Premier League game since tearing his ACL roughly 18 months ago. He's been given a few starts here and there in cup games, but he's largely been reduced to a substitute's role, meaning he can't gain any fitness or rhythm.\n\nPerhaps a change of scenery is just what he needs, and the Bundesliga looks a good fit for him: At he's best he's a talented, creative player, but regardless of form or fitness, he's always the hardest worker on the pitch, happy to press high and willing to track back. Leverkusen will have a \u20ac20m option to sign him permanently if they want.\n\nJan. 27\n\nRENATO VEIGA\n\nLoan\n\nChelsea: A-\n\nJuventus: B\n\nJuventus have been sailing very close to the wind on centre-back numbers these last few months; with Danilo gone and Bremer out for the season injured, they're using the same partnership - Federico Gatti and Pierre Kalulu - in basically every game they play. Depth was clearly needed, and while it's taken them most of the month to sort it, a loan for Veiga at least gives them the insurance they were looking for (and he can deputise at left-back too).\n\nChelsea are receiving a \u20ac5m loan fee for a player they don't need, so that will no doubt help them regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\n\nJan. 25\n\nANTONY\n\nLoan\n\nManchester United: A\n\nReal Betis: B+\n\nThere's shades of the Randal Kolo Muani deal here, with Manchester United realising the same thing PSG did: The only way to stand any chance of one day recouping a decent fee for an unwanted player is to get him out on loan and playing first, in order to rebuild his confidence. But it's quite a turnaround from his \u20ac95m arrival.\n\nThere are plenty of games to go around at Real Betis, including UEFA Conference League knockouts, so Antony stands a good chance of playing in southern Spain. He also feels like the exact type of mercurial, inconsistent forward the club are known for signing, so there's every chance the fans take to him.\n\nJan. 24\n\nKYLE WALKER\n\nLoan\n\nManchester City: A\n\nAC Milan: D\n\nFor many transfers, it's about how much you paid and how much you recouped; but in Walker's case, it's about ensuring a player whose incredible 7\u00bd years of service is rewarded with a manner of exit of his choosing.\n\nWalker's form this season has dropped off a cliff and both parties have recognised that in parting ways. Perhaps a change of scenery rejuvenates him, but this seems like an odd deal from Milan's perspective -- especially when you consider they're reportedly covering his entire \u20ac200,000-per-week wage packet and have a \u20ac5m option to sign him permanently.\n\nMICHAEL KAYODE\n\nLoan\n\nFiorentina: C+\n\nBrentford: B+\n\nRight-back has proven a problem position for Brentford this season; three different players have played there in the absence of the injured Aaron Hickey, two of them being giant centre-backs, as manager Thomas Frank searches for answers.\n\nKayode is an intriguing solution. He's extremely energetic and positive, always playing forward and always looking for an overlap. There's work to be done on the technical side of his game, but he should suit a reactive team like Brentford. Securing a loan with a \u20ac16m option to sign permanently is great work from the Bees, but somewhat questionable from Fiorentina's end -- even if he has been demoted to a squad role of late.\n\nJan. 23\n\nEintracht Frankfurt: A+\n\nManchester City: B\n\nNo one has had a more transformative 18 months than Marmoush, who joined Eintracht Frankfurt on a free transfer in 2023, but has now made a blockbuster move to the reigning English champions.\n\nMarmoush scored and assisted at will last season and has continued in the same vein this term, attracting interest from most of Europe, so Eintracht set a huge asking price. City, who are desperate for confidence and creativity, coughed up \u20ac70m, plus another \u20ac5m-\u20ac10m in add-ons, which is no small sum for a player who spent years in the wilderness before only recently hitting his stride.\n\nWhile the signing does carry some risk, it's clear why City took the plunge: He's fast, strong, creative and an expert set-piece taker. He might be the shot in the arm they need.\n\nRANDAL KOLO MUANI\n\nLoan\n\nParis Saint-Germain: A\n\nJuventus: A\n\nThings went wrong for Kolo Muani at PSG as he fell out of favour with manager Luis Enrique, despite the fact he's an established France international and the club spent \u20ac80m to sign him from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023. But just because he doesn't appear to suit Luis Enrique doesn't change the fact that, when fit and firing, he's an excellent striker. He just needs a bit of rhythm.\n\nKolo Muani could well prove a great, opportunistic pickup for a Juventus side that struggles to turn draws into wins. Meanwhile, from PSG's perspective, this straight loan is a chance for Kolo Muani to regain some market value ahead of a potential permanent (and more expensive) exit in the summer.\n\nJan. 21\n\nPalmeiras: A-\n\nManchester City: A\n\nAccording to ESPN's Tim Vickery, Vitor Reis is a classy defender with huge potential. Strong defensively, assured on the ball and comfortable in a back three or four, he has all the ingredients to become a top centre-back; he just needs to fill out physically.\n\nA \u20ac35m fee represents a Brazilian league record received for a defender, vastly eclipsing the \u20ac20m PSG paid to sign Lucas Beraldo in 2024. With that, Palmeiras should be happy enough -- although they did want him to stick around for the Club World Cup this summer, so losing him six months early might sting.\n\nJan. 20\n\nLens: B\n\nManchester City: A-\n\nCity are in dire need of defensive reinforcements, so signing one of the best young centre-backs in the world is certainly a good start on that front. Khusanov is extremely fast and reads defensive situations well so, despite being just 20 years of age, could positively impact this team from the get-go. He'll need to improve his passing, but that can come with time.\n\nLens could eventually receive up to \u20ac48m for this deal, which is a lot for a French club not named PSG. But they know deep down he could have gone for even more had they been able to hang onto him for another few months.\n\nJan. 17\n\nNapoli: D\n\nParis Saint-Germain: B+\n\nThis is undoubtedly the January transfer window's top storyline so far: Kvaratskhelia, a hero in Naples for his part in the 2023 title win, effectively walking out on the club halfway through another title tilt and joining PSG.\n\nIt's a disaster for Napoli, who have lost a sensational, talismanic player for what is a fairly modest fee. Manager Antonio Conte has effectively revealed that in not letting him go last summer, it has cost the club money.\n\nPSG will be delighted to get an exceptional winger on the (relative) cheap, but it must be pointed out that this was hardly a position of concern for the club given they already have Bradley Barcola, an in-form Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9, and several others on their squad.\n\nJan. 15\n\nAston Villa: A\n\nIpswich Town: B\n\nIpswich wanted to sign Philogene in the summer but were beaten to the deal by Villa, who reacquired him from Hull City with big expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations haven't been met (aside from one superb performance in the Champions League against Bayern Munich) and he has moved on just six months later.\n\nFor Villa, banking \u00a320m for a player who very quickly lost his way at the Premier League level will undoubtedly be very satisfactory. That loss of form and confidence means Ipswich are taking a slight gamble, but he'd no doubt be a star for them in the Championship next season if the worst were to happen.\n\nJan. 14\n\nBorussia Dortmund: B+\n\nAston Villa: C+\n\nMalen has felt destined to depart Dortmund for some time now; for one reason or another, he has never quite fit there, with injuries playing a part in that, as well as the general disruption at the club. BVB will be happy enough with the fee received.\n\nVilla is a slightly surprising destination, but perhaps Unai Emery sees him as a replacement for Moussa Diaby -- someone who can play wide or behind the striker and score goals -- who they were forced to move on last summer to meet UEFA's Squad Cost Ratio rules. Malen will need to up his game to prove worth the outlay of \u20ac25m, which could rise to \u20ac30m with add-ons.\n\nJan. 9\n\nStade de Reims: B+\n\nWolves: B+\n\nCentre backs come in vastly different forms, and it's safe to say Agbadou is of the more active type. He racks up tackles, interceptions, duels won and clearances willingly, showcasing good strength and an ability to do a bit of everything. Stylistically, think similar to Chelsea's Axel Disasi.\n\nWolves are badly in need of central defensive help, so Agbadou looks like a plug-and-play signing who immediately lifts them. The fact that he has spent 2\u00bd years in Ligue 1 is a bonus there, as players tend to translate very effectively from France to England. Both teams should come away happy enough with the fee exchanged.\n\nJan. 7\n\nLan\u00fas: B+\n\nBournemouth: A\n\nIt should come as no surprise to see Bournemouth hit the market for a left back, given their current incumbent, Milos Kerkez, is so highly thought of by the world's top teams. This looks a lot like the Cherries are planning ahead, which is undoubtedly smart.\n\nLan\u00fas have a reputation for developing stellar fullback talent, and Soler will now be managed by a very good former fullback in Andoni Iraola. The 19-year-old's game is packed with energy and aggression, and he's already on the cusp of the Argentina national team. This feels like a match made in heaven. The initial fee looks a little low for such an established prospect, but the deal could rise to \u00a311.5m if targets are hit -- that would be a Lan\u00fas club-record fee.\n\nJan. 5\n\nSlavia Prague: A\n\nSpurs: B+\n\nGuglielmo Vicario's injury this season made clear how short Spurs had left themselves in the goalkeeper department. As a backup, Fraser Forster ticks the veteran box, but doesn't actually suit Ange Postecoglou's ball-playing system.\n\nThat makes 21-year-old Kinsky one for the future, but also one for the now, too. He has been praised for his long distribution and ability to use both feet, which will lead to some early opportunities to stake his claim. His first game in the Carabao Cup vs. Liverpool worked out pretty well.\n\nplay 1:04 What are Tottenham getting with Mathys Tel signing? Julien Laurens explains why he thinks of new Spurs signing Mathys Tel as the \"complete package\" when it comes to forwards.\n\nJan. 1\n\nGangwon FC: B\n\nSpurs: A\n\nTottenham beat a host of competition to sign Yang, the freshly crowned Korean League Young Player of the Year. He joins the club that South Korean compatriot and idol Son Heung-Min has made so famous in his nation -- something that perhaps made Spurs the most likely destination all along.\n\nThe fee isn't an awful lot for a Premier League side to stake on potential, so from Tottenham's perspective, this is low-risk, high-reward business. His 12 goals and six assists last season suggest there's plenty of upside. It may seem to be a paltry fee for Gangwon, but the perception in South Korea is that this is a strong return.\n\nInter Miami: C+\n\nBrighton: B+\n\nG\u00f3mez has moved from Paraguay to MLS to the Premier League in the space of just 18 months, with Brighton happy to strike early for the potential he has quickly shown. There has always been a rough rule of thumb in football that any player Lionel Messi clearly enjoys playing with is likely a quality one -- so G\u00f3mez's on-pitch connection with the Argentina legend at Inter Miami speaks volumes.\n\nMiami have described the fee received as \"among the most expensive outbound transfers in MLS history,\" but when compared to previous deals, it's tough to shake the feeling that it's a little on the low side.",

(1:04)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha is eyeing a summer move, while Manchester United are plotting a surprise swoop for fellow Brazilian Wesley Fran\u00e7a. Join us for the latest transfer news, rumors and gossip from around the globe.\n\nTransfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades\n\nTOP STORIES\n\n- Bayern's Davies signs deal amid Madrid interest\n\n- Sporting's Viana leaves club ahead of City move\n\n- Man City nearly outspend all PL clubs in January\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers' Matheus Cunha will be in demand in the summer. (Photo by Jack Thomas - WWFC/Wolves via Getty Images)\n\nTRENDING RUMORS\n\n- Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha is eager to join a \"bigger club\" despite recently signing a new deal, Football Insider reports. The Brazilian had been the subject of interest from Arsenal, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest in January, all of whom are expected to be vying for his signature again in the summer. The inclusion of a release clause in the 25-year-old's new Wolves contract was reportedly \"demanded\" by the player, who is eyeing a transfer once it becomes active in June.\n\n- Manchester United are considering a move for Flamengo wonderkid Wesley Fran\u00e7a this summer, reports Goal. The full-back is one of Brazil's most promising youngsters, having been a regular for the Rio club since the 2023 season. PSR (profit and sustainability rules) limited United's ability to bid for Wesley in January, but the club should have more financial wriggle room in July. The 21-year-old has already been the subject of a $25 million bid from Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg, which was rejected by his current club. Flamengo are hopeful that a string of impressive displays at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup could drive up the player's value.\n\n- Galatasaray are pushing to sign Empoli defender Saba Goglichidze this month, reports Gianluca Di Marzio. The Georgia international has played 20 times this season in Serie A, having joined Empoli last January from Torpedo Kutaisi. With the Turkish transfer window not closing until Feb. 11, Galatasaray have a week to try to sort out a deal for Goglichidze. Though their first offer was rejected by the Italian side -- who wouldn't be able to sign a replacement -- a follow-up bid could soon arrive in Tuscany.\n\n- Samuel Chukwueze is expected to remain at AC Milan until the end of the season after his proposed Fulham transfer collapsed, reports Revelo. The winger had been on the verge of moving to west London in a deal worth \u20ac30m, but the two clubs ran out of time on deadline day because of issues surrounding an obligatory purchase option. While some transfer markets remain open for the next few days, Chukwueze is now expected to remain in Milan. The 25-year-old has made 19 appearances in Serie A this season, scoring twice.\n\n- Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Petar Su\u010di\u0107 is expected to undergo a medical at Internazionale on Friday ahead of his summer transfer, Nicolo Schira reports. The \u20ac16m deal will see Su\u010di\u0107 join up with his new teammates in June -- just in time for him to feature at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup. The 21-year-old, who is a Croatia international, has already agreed to terms on a five-year deal with Inter.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIt wasn't a subtle dig. It wasn't a veiled reference to an opponent. None of that faux 'respect' for a player who'd achieved plenty in the modern game. This was in-your-face, brash, swagger dripping-from-every-cell arrogance from an 18-year-old - and it was beautiful.\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly scored his first goal for Arsenal in their 5-1 rout of Manchester City, and with his celebration, firmly announced to the world, and Erling Haaland in particular, what he intends to be: a superstar.\n\nThere was plenty of needle coming into this game, the 2-2 draw at the Etihad in September was still fresh in the minds of the Arsenal players. Erling Haaland had ended that game as City celebrated a last-gasp draw against 10-man Arsenal with the words 'Stay humble, eh?' to Mikel Arteta. He'd also thrown a ball off Gabriel Magalhaes' head in celebration and shouted 'who the f*** are you?' at Lewis-Skelly.\n\nTo say he was persona-non-grata at the Emirates was an understatement. As Arsenal made a fast start to the game with Odegaard's goal, and Martinelli's effort being ruled out for offside, Gabriel wasted no time in celebrating in Haaland's face. Even if their manager disagreed, the players had trained their focus on one opponent in particular, the grudge deeply held.\n\nLewis-Skelly, about six inches shorter than the Norwegian striker, even outmuscled Haaland off the ball in an early duel. It underlined why his teammates trusted him despite his young age, and his speed of adaptation into the Arsenal first XI. This was a player who earned himself a yellow card before even stepping on the pitch for Arsenal, a player who celebrated being booked and substituted against Tottenham by geeing the crowd up and reveling in the adulation.\n\nHaaland vs Lewis-Skelly wasn't going to be a battle of shrinking violets.\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly held his own in physical duels against Erling Haaland. Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\nThe City striker did have his moment, rising tall at the back post to bring City level in the second half. City's joy was short lived, though, as Thomas Partey restored Arsenal's lead almost immediately, but the game was still finely poised. City had shown glimpses of their treble-winning selves and could hurt Arsenal at a moment's notice.\n\nAs the clock ticked over to 61:42, Arsenal had another one of their patient probing spells down the left wing. Except Lewis-Skelly, ostensibly a left-back, was in the box ahead of even Martin Odegaard. He'd been a midfielder at his time in the Arsenal academy and it showed with his comfort on the ball.\n\nPartey, Gabriel and Declan Rice rotated the ball amongst themselves with cautious passes, aiming to move City's defensive structure around in specific ways. Rice had the ball on the left touchline, and Arsenal had five players in their attacking line, three of them in the box. City expected a cross, Havertz and Odegaard made runs towards heading positions in the box, but Lewis-Skelly dropped in between the lines on the edge of the box, pointing to his feet and asking for the ball.\n\nThe diversion worked as Rice obliged, and Lewis-Skelly had the time and space to collect, turn and rush into the box. Three City players converged on him, and facing up to John Stones, the Arsenal midfielder made a minor move towards shooting on his left foot. Stones leapt in a bit to eagerly to block, happy to allow Lewis-Skelly onto his 'weaker' right foot.\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly scores the 3rd Arsenal goal in their 5-1 win against Manchester City. Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\nThere is beauty in the simplicity of a younger footballing mind. Kai Havertz and Martin Odegaard, two very left footed players spurned multiple opportunities this season in a bid to work a better angle with their stronger foot, dallying on the ball. No such thing for Lewis-Skelly: Stones gave him half-a-yard on his right foot, so he shot with his right foot.\n\nThe strike was powerful, curled toward the far end, and even if Stefan Ortega in the City net got a hand to the ball, it only served to enhance the drama of the moment as the ball looped into the top corner. Cue, bedlam in the stands.\n\nLewis-Skelly, meanwhile? He still had a point to make. Off he ran towards the corner flag, and out came the celebration. One Haaland had done so often - the yoga pose - and Lewis-Skelly was mocking that very celebration to make a pointed statement.\n\nThe Arsenal players gathered round, senior pros in adulation for a youngster making the Emirates his own. Almost a renaissance painting, the moment captured by the cameras seemed to finally answer Haaland's question in Manchester -- 'Who the f*** are you?'\n\n'This is who I am.'\n\nFor re-kindling rivalries, for not yielding to sanitized requirements of footballers nowadays, for simply grabbing his moment, Myles Lewis-Skelly takes our Moment of the Week.",

The big difference? That was City's first season back in the Premier Leaguer after being relegated in 2000-01.\n\n6\n\nArsenal is the 6th different team to score 4 or more goals in a Premier League game vs Manchester City under Pep Guardiola (Leicester is the only one to do it twice.)\n\n5\n\nMikel Arteta is now unbeaten in five straight games against Manchester City (W2 D3), tied for the longest run by a manager against Pep Guardiola, after Thomas Tuchel (2016-2021) and J\u00fcrgen Klopp (2021-2022).\n\n1.44\n\nMartin \u00d8degaard (1 minute, 44 seconds) scored the fastest goal of his professional career (club or country.) This was also Arsenal's fastest goal in a Premier League match since December 2022.\n\n250\n\nErling Haaland's goal was his 250th in senior club football in 313 games. He has reached 250 club goals in fewer appearances than Lionel Messi (327), Kylian Mbappe (332), Harry Kane (450), or Cristiano Ronaldo (451).\n\n7\n\nManchester United has lost seven of its first 13 home games in the Premier League this season, tied for its most at this stage of a league campaign, along with 1893-94 (also 7).\n\nManchester United had not lost SEVEN of their first 13 home matches of the league season since 1893-94 \ufffd\ufffd OVER 130 YEARS! pic.twitter.com/LE3xahbVhv - ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) February 2, 2025\n\n7\n\nManchester United's 7 home losses tie the most by a 'Big 6' club through 24 games of a Premier League season (That was Manchester City in 2000-01, back when they were relegated.)\n\n44\n\nManchester United has lost 44 Premier League home games since Sir Alex Ferguson retired after the 2012-13 season.

The last time the race was this tight between the top 3 through 22 GP was 2014-15. Barcelona went on to win that title by 2 points over Madrid.\n\n1\n\nThis was Real Madrid's first La Liga loss to a team other than Barcelona, Athletic Club or Atletico Madrid since May 2023 (Valencia.)\n\n1\n\nThis was Espanyol's first win vs Real Madrid in La Liga since October, 2021.\n\n1\n\nThis is the first time Espanyol beat Real Madrid while being in the bottom 3 of the table entering the match day since the 1981-82 season. Back then, 16th place Espanyol beat fourth place Real Madrid 1-0, in an 18-team league.\n\n16\n\nReal Madrid had gone 16 straight matches scoring at least 1 goal in all competitions (multiple goals in last 14 matches). The last time it failed to do so was in the UEFA Champions League vs Liverpool in November.\n\n21\n\nYamal attempted 21 dribbles against Alav\u00e9s, completing 11 of them.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWe have a title race on our hands in LaLiga. For now, the two teams in the Spanish capital are still best positioned, but Real Madrid's shock defeat on Saturday has opened the door for their rivals in Catalonia, too.\n\nIn the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur earned their first league win since December, stringing together back-to-back clean sheets for just the third time this season. Is it the start of a turnaround?\n\nMeanwhile, in the Bundesliga, RB Leipzig's winless streak reached four games. The club that as recently as December looked like Bayern Munich's closest challenger is suddenly 18 points behind the leaders.\n\nSam Tighe, Sam Marsden and Constantin Eckner make observations from across Europe to bring you up to speed on what you might have missed this weekend.\n\nTop takeaway: Spurs show some steel. Is it a turning point?\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium has been a fierce place to visit this season, and while Brentford's form there has sloped off a little of late, that can largely be attributed to a run of horror fixtures: Nottingham Forest, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool in a row. On paper, the visit of Tottenham Hotspur completed a quintet of extreme challenges, but in reality, this season's Spurs have often been a soft touch and an easy win.\n\nWell, they were no soft touch here, despite what the team sheet may have suggested. Spurs once again rocked up with a defense that looked completely out of sorts -- there wasn't an established center back to be seen, while the left back was in fact a right back -- plus Dominic Solanke and James Maddison were missing, too. Put simply, this did not look like a team capable of dealing with the Brentford barrage.\n\nBut deal with it they did. They made clearance after clearance, tackle after tackle, and when all else failed, Djed Spence blocked one on the line. At the other end they scored via a set piece and an incisive transition move. Son Heung-Min was hugely influential in both goals and worked his socks off tracking back, epitomizing a true team display in the 2-0 win.\n\nIncluding the midweek win over Elfsborg in the UEFA Europa League, that's two clean sheets on the bounce for Ange Postecoglou, plus defensive help is on its way courtesy of the transfer window. Is this the turning point he has no doubt been longing for?\n\nBest match: Arsenal 5-1 Manchester City\n\nA clash between these two is appointment viewing these days, and while the score ended up a little one-sided, it was a great battle with just the right amount of needle in it. To sum it up: Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es celebrated Arsenal's opener in Erling Haaland's face; the striker's equalizing goal brought a pointed response; 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly then scored his first Arsenal goal and crowned it with Haaland's \"zen\" celebration; and Kai Havertz completed his own redemptive arc with the final goal as signs that read \"stay humble\" were held aloft around the stadium -- a reference to Haaland's jibe directed at Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta in the reverse fixture back in September.\n\nThis is a proper rivalry!\n\nplay 2:07 Echegaray: Victory over Man City a statement from Arsenal in title race Luis Miguel Echegaray praises Arsenal after their impressive 5-1 win over Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nCunha saved his best for the last minute against Villa, where he scored a spectacular solo goal to seal the win. Beating Ezri Konsa one-on-one is not easy, yet he did it twice in the space of 10 seconds before smashing into the net from a position that did not look possible. The celebration -- \"I'm staying right here\" -- was epic, too.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Mohamed Salah, Liverpool\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say AFC Bournemouth represent one of the trickiest opponents in the Premier League right now, and the difficulty Liverpool had in overcoming them this weekend proved it so. In a game in which the Cherries created -- but missed -- their chances to win it, the value of having Salah was hammered home ever harder. He scored twice in a 2-0 win, giving him 34 goal contributions for the season. -- Tighe\n\nTop takeaway: Madrid let Bar\u00e7a, Atl\u00e9ti back into title race\n\nReal Madrid's daylight at the top of LaLiga disappeared this weekend as they suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to struggling Espanyol, which left coach Carlo Ancelotti blasting the \"inexplicable\" decision not to send off match winner Carlos Romero.\n\nAs Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Barcelona have slipped up in recent weeks, Real had pieced together a four-game winning streak that had seen them open up a four-point lead at the top of the table. That run ended on Saturday as Espanyol blunted Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham before snatching all three points on the break through Romero inside the final 10 minutes.\n\nThe win took Espanyol out of the bottom three, but it left a sour taste in Ancelotti's mouth. As chants from the home fans of \"Yes we can [stay up]\" seeped through the press room walls, the Italian coach complained Romero had not been dismissed early in the second half for a high, lunging challenge on Mbapp\u00e9 to stop a counterattack.\n\nAfter Real Madrid were upset by Espanyol on Saturday, their lead atop LaLiga was cut to a single point. Diego Souto/Getty Images\n\n\"Fortunately nothing happened in terms of an injury, but VAR is there for that,\" Ancelotti said. \"It's inexplicable to us that there wasn't a red card.\"\n\nHe may have had a point, but it was also a handy deflection from the continued debate about whether a front four of Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius, Rodrygo and Bellingham takes too much away from the team defensively.\n\nMeanwhile, Atl\u00e9tico are now within one point of Madrid after beating Mallorca 2-0, while Bar\u00e7a are four points back after a hard-fought 1-0 win over Alav\u00e9s on Sunday.\n\nThe best performance of the weekend came from Villarreal, who put five past Real Valladolid to keep within touching distance of the UEFA Champions League places. The pick of the goals were the opener from top scorer Ayoze P\u00e9rez and a clean strike from 20 yards from Pape Gueye. \"The fans shouldn't get used to seeing five goals every match,\" coach Marcelino joked after the win.\n\nBest goal: Antoine Griezmann vs. Mallorca\n\nThe Frenchman produced a fine lobbed finish from outside the box to seal Atl\u00e9tico's 2-0 win over Mallorca as they got back to winning ways after two outings without victory in LaLiga.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Joan Garc\u00eda, Espanyol\n\nTo beat Madrid, you need to take the few chances that come your way, a little bit of luck and a goalkeeper on form. Espanyol had that on Saturday, with Garc\u00eda producing seven saves to keep the league leaders out, including a fine double stop from Bellingham and Mbapp\u00e9 early in the second half. Espanyol may struggle to keep the 23-year-old for long. -- Marsden\n\nTop takeaway: Leipzig continue to spiral\n\nRB Leipzig manager Marco Rose was openly disappointed by his team's performance at Union Berlin on Saturday. The uneventful 0-0 draw against the team sitting 14th in the Bundesliga table came off a 1-0 loss to Sturm Graz in the Champions League, ending a disappointing European campaign for Rose's side.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. Leipzig were able to sign Xavi Simons on a permanent deal from Paris Saint-Germain for a transfer fee that could rise to \u20ac80 million, despite serious interest from big-name clubs in the 21-year-old midfielder.\n\nLeipzig don't lack individual quality, though, but remain strikingly limited when in possession. Rose has not found a way to set up his team to allow Simons, Lo\u00efs Openda and Benjamin Sesko to score on a constant basis. Paired with defensive woes that have only slightly improved since the return of centre-back Willi Orb\u00e1n, Leipzig have spent much of this season behind the eight ball.\n\nFollowing the goalless draw at Union, sporting director Marcel Sch\u00e4fer pointed out the lack of offensive productivity, saying, \"One can expect from us that we create chances, find better solutions in the buildup and retain possession of the ball down the field.\"\n\nplay 0:38 Why Xavi Simons' move to RB Leipzig is a great deal for PSG Julien Laurens believes Xavi Simons's permanent deal with RB Leipzig will greatly benefit Paris Saint Germain moving forward.\n\nWe will see how many more lackluster performances have to happen before Rose might fear for his job.\n\nBest match: Bayern Munich 4-3 Holstein Kiel\n\nThe score line looks much closer than the game was for the most part. Bayern were leading 4-0 at the hour mark but almost managed to fumble three points, as Kiel's Steven Skrzybski scored two late goals.\n\n\"We cannot lose our principles,\" Joshua Kimmich said. \"If we lose them, then we are a normal team. Then we are vulnerable against every opponent.\"\n\nBest goal: Serge Gnabry vs. Holstein Kiel\n\nBayern's fourth goal was a real beauty thanks to Gnabry, who had come on at half-time. He initiated the attack from the right wing and then capitalized from a deflected Kingsley Coman shot inside the box with great control from his right foot to make Marco Komenda miss, before crashing in a volley with his left.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Waldemar Anton, Borussia Dortmund\n\nLet's praise a Dortmund defender for once this season. In what was interim manager Mike Tullberg's final game in charge of the Bundesliga team, Anton had an impressive showing, as Dortmund beat Heidenheim 2-1. He completed 97% of his passes, won all of his four dribble attempts and all of his defensive aerials. -- Eckner\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nWhat else you missed this weekend\n\nMilan's derby dent to Inter's Scudetto charge\n\nDerby days don't get much more frustrating than the one Inter Milan experienced against fierce rivals AC Milan on Sunday -- but credit to them, they absolutely refused to be beaten.\n\nFor a long, long time -- 93 minutes, in fact -- it looked like \"one of those nights\" for the Nerazzurri. Manager Simone Inzaghi watched on in horror as his team had three goals disallowed and hit the post three times, failing to respond to Tijjani Reijnders' goal on the stroke of half-time.\n\nWith every Inter chance missed, Milan's chests puffed outwards a little more. Fikayo Tomori led a determined, gritty effort that did so well for so long, and also saw Kyle Walker make his debut in red and black.\n\nIn the end, though, the pressure told. Inter pushed and pushed, bombarded the box, and another debutant, Nicola Zalewski -- signed on loan from AS Roma on Saturday -- chested a ball back across goal for Stefan de Vrij to stab home and rescue a 1-1 draw.\n\nA point was nothing short of what Inter deserved, but it still opens the door for Napoli to move four points clear at the top of Serie A. -- Tighe\n\nPiatek has been reborn in Turkey\n\nThere was a time when Krzysztof Piatek looked like the next great Poland striker, ready to follow in Robert Lewandowski's footsteps. Suffice it to say, things did not exactly work out as hoped. He moved from Hertha Berlin to Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir in 2023, where he impressed in his first Super Lig season but has been completely on fire since November, scoring 12 goals in eight league games and four goals in four UEFA Conference League games.\n\nPiatek's hat trick against Samsunspor on Saturday was his fourth since coming to the Super Lig.\n\n\"Piatek is no longer just a penalty area player,\" former Poland international Artur Wichniarek commented after Piatek's three-goal performance put him top of the Super Lig's goal scoring charts. \"He also plays outside of it.\"\n\nIt is quite unrealistic that, at 29, he will get another shot at a big club as he did when AC Milan signed him in 2019, but his resurgence in Turkey has been great to see. -- Eckner",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTransfer Deadline Day is exciting for supporters, a crucial financial date for clubs and great content for every media outlet, but what is it like for the players involved?\n\nDeadline Day is about uncertainty and apprehension for some and confusion for others. It is a day when lives and careers can be turned upside down, in a good way or a bad way. A new challenge can emerge out of nothing with a dream move to a bigger club or reality could hit hard with a last-minute transfer that has only come about due to desperation.\n\nSo with so much at stake for players on Deadline Day, ESPN has spoken to four footballers who have lived through the experience of making a move on the final day of the transfer window.\n\nEditor's note: Julien Laurens and Sam Marsden contributed to this report.\n\nOlivier Giroud\n\nMoved from Arsenal to Chelsea on winter Deadline Day, 2018\n\n\"It is a really strange time for any player involved in late negotiations towards the end of a transfer window. It depends a lot [on] your situation: You could be wanted by another club but not want to move, you could want to move by ambition or for game time or for another reason, or you might be forced to move.\n\n\"For me, it was January 2018. I was 31 and I didn't want to leave Arsenal, but I had to because I was not playing enough with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season. I couldn't continue like that; it was too frustrating. I told [my former manager] Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at the time that I had to play, and I knew he was recruiting [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang too. I was disappointed to leave, but it was logical to give my career a new direction, so I was pushing for a transfer.\n\n\"I could have gone to Dortmund, who really wanted me and offered me a top contract. Roma and Sevilla contacted my agent, too, but ideally, I didn't want to leave London, which limited my possibilities. My third child was born around that time too: My family was always going to stay in London and I wanted to stay there with them, especially with a newborn. That's why I didn't want to go to Germany.\n\n\"Thankfully Chelsea came for me. I spoke to Antonio Conte and he told me he really wanted to work with me. I needed to play before the World Cup, and after five years at Arsenal where I gave my best, Chelsea felt the right move to keep playing and winning trophies. Chelsea were a dominant force then in England.\n\nOlivier Giroud knew he needed a deadline day move in order to get playing time and hopefully make the France squad for the 2018 World Cup. In the end, Chelsea came through, Giroud made the squad, and France won the trophy in Russia that summer. Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images\n\n\"It was like a game of poker. I was in touch with my agent all the time, waiting for news. It is a stressful time for you and your family, for sure. It dragged on. You have to be prepared mentally for any eventuality. If you move, you have to organize what you do with your family, the kids' schools, your house, your cars -- everything in a very short time.\n\n\"You also don't want to plan ahead, so you don't jinx anything! Footballers are very superstitious. And if you don't move, you are disappointed because you know that for six months, that's it, you will stay where you are and often you are not happy in that environment, hence why you wanted to move.\n\n\"In the end, the transfer happened and everyone was happy.\"\n\nFraizer Campbell\n\nMoved from Man United to Tottenham on summer Deadline Day, 2008\n\n\"I was with England U21s down south and was told by United that they had agreed to send me on loan to Wigan, so I had to get back up north and sign the paperwork. I'd spent the previous season on loan at Hull, winning promotion to the Premier League, and was still only 20, so it was a good move for me. Wigan were a Premier League club, Steve Bruce was a top manager, and it would have meant working and playing with Emile Heskey -- it was a great chance to learn and develop my game alongside a top striker.\n\nFraizer Campbell was all set for a Deadline Day move on loan to Wigan, but a late phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson ended up sending him to Tottenham instead. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\n\"On Deadline Day, I met Steve Bruce with my dad at a hotel near Wigan and it was fairly straightforward. We agreed the deal, signed the paperwork and faxed it back to United as they had to complete everything at their end. It was midafternoon, so everything seemed to be going smoothly, but the fax from United never came and myself, my dad and Steve were just waiting in this hotel room for the deal to be done.\n\n\"It gets to 11 p.m. and there was still no fax from United, so we start to panic. Then we get to 11:30 and my phone rings. It's a withheld number, and the rule is not to answer a withheld number! But because of the situation, I took the call and it was Sir Alex Ferguson. I was still a kid, I'd obviously spoken to him at United, but never over the phone, so it was a bit unusual.\n\n\"He told me that United were trying to sign Dimitar Berbatov for \u00a330 million, but the deal would only go through if I agreed to move to Spurs on loan as part of the deal. Sir Alex said, 'Take your time, think about it and I'll call you back in two minutes!'\n\n\"I was sat with Steve Bruce and my dad, and I had two minutes to make up my mind! To be honest, it was Spurs -- a huge club -- and Steve Bruce was great. He had played, he knew the game and while he was disappointed, he accepted I couldn't turn Spurs down.\n\n\"My family wasn't impacted; I was only 20, so I didn't have a wife and kids to think about, but it was still a whirlwind. I was a couple of weeks away from my 21st birthday, so had planned a big celebration with my friends. We had booked a day of go-karting, but that all had to be canceled because I was moving away and would be in a London hotel instead.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\n\"I had no problem with the upheaval. I was young, I had some family in London, but I have always taken the chance to move with the job. I had already been on loan at Royal Antwerp in Belgium as an 18-year-old, so I wasn't fazed by the move. But had I been 10 years older with a family, I can see how difficult it would have been to do the same move. It was definitely stressful, even at a young age.\n\n\"Was the move a good thing? Wigan would have been a good move for me, but with Spurs, I was training every day with Luka Modric and Gareth Bale, so I could have no complaints. Juande Ramos was the coach and he was really good with me. Told me how much he rated me and wanted me in his team, but he was sacked soon afterwards and replaced by Harry Redknapp, who brought in his own players.\n\n\"I had a year at Spurs and then signed for Sunderland the following year, so I had earned a good move on the back of it. I wouldn't change anything and I don't look back thinking how my career would have played out had I gone to Wigan, but it was definitely an experience to move on Deadline Day.\"\n\nJuli\u00e1n Araujo\n\nMoved from LA Galaxy to Barcelona, summer Deadline Day 2023. Not all deals go as planned as clubs rush to meet deadlines. In 2023, Bar\u00e7a filed the paperwork to sign Araujo 18 seconds after the deadline because of what the club claimed was a computer error. FIFA denied Bar\u00e7a's subsequent appeal. Araujo, a \u20ac4 million signing, still joined the club, but he was not able to play for six months, when the next registration window opened.\n\n\"I was frustrated, there was nothing I could do about it. My part was done, my part was handled. That's one of the things that I've learned throughout my career is just to handle what you can control.\"\n\nMartin Braithwaite\n\nMoved from Legan\u00e9s to Barcelona after Deadline Day, winter 2020. Braithwaite was an exceptional case in that he secured his dream move after the transfer window had closed. The striker (now with Gremio) joined Barcelona in February 2020, when the Catalan club took advantage of a LaLiga rule that allowed them to sign a replacement to cover an injured player. Braithwaite was so nervous about scuppering the deal that he tried to keep it a secret from everyone -- including his wife.\n\n\"Usually I tell everything to my wife, but she only knew because it suddenly got leaked in the media. It got leaked in the morning and I didn't see her until the evening. My phone had been ringing all day, and I know hers was the same. When I told her I had to talk to her, she knew why. She understood!\n\n\"I just felt, you know, that I am going to wait and see how this goes. If it's going to get 100% serious, then I will let [my wife] know, but there's no reason to get people around me excited. I got excited, but I knew if I told people they were going to be talking about it every day.\n\n\"For me, it was fine to have it in my mind and not give it too much attention until it was concrete. Friends and family would want news all the time, and that can lead your mind to not being in the moment. I wanted to stay focused and leave it with my agents.\n\nMartin Braithwaite was an emergency signing for Barcelona and technically outside the transfer window, but it was another move that turned out well. Marc Gonzalez / AFP7 / Europa Press Sports via Getty Images\n\n\"Overall, moving to Barcelona was a good experience. I moved to the biggest club in the world, but it was strange because I had always visualized myself there, always been thinking about it. Arriving [at Barca], with all the circumstances, all the press and everything, of course you feel it's something big.\n\n\"When I started training, it was just like another club. I felt it was really natural, I felt really welcome by everyone at the club, all the players, the fans ... they welcomed me with open arms. I appreciated that.\n\n\"Leaving Legan\u00e9s was difficult. Sometimes when you leave a club, you can leave with mixed feelings, but they totally understood. They said this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance, so you have to take it. They would have done the same. They truly understood me. They felt it was unfair they couldn't get a replacement, which I understand.\n\n\"Even [Legan\u00e9s] manager Javier Aguirre was kind about it. You don't have to mess with him, because he will put you in your place, but he has a big heart. [When I left] he told me go and enjoy. He said you have to go, this is your career, this is a big opportunity, of course you have to take it, just go and kill it.\"",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe weekend is over and Deadline Day is upon us, but we have a lot to unpack following another wild weekend across Europe's top soccer leagues. Pep Guardiola and Manchester City fell to a 5-1 thrashing at Arsenal that was entirely deserved given their poor performance, leaving him a lot to figure out. The Milan derby delivered a ton of fireworks in Serie A, with Inter's late goal earning them a 1-1 draw and showing that they're a credible contender for the title despite Napoli's slender three-point lead atop the table.\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool got a fortunate win at in-form Bournemouth despite not playing brilliantly. Should Arne Slot & Co. be concerned about the squad's fitness levels heading into a critical period of the season? And Real Madrid lost at Espanyol in dramatic fashion.\n\nBeyond that, there was a lot to unpack about Barcelona, Tottenham, Bayern Munich, Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, Bayer Leverkusen and others, so let's get to it. Here are musings and reactions to the most memorable moments of the weekend.\n\nIt's not the score that should concern Pep Guardiola, but the performance\n\nBreak it down and you can explain away several of Arsenal's goals -- arguably those of Ethan Nwaneri, Miles Lewis-Skelly and Thomas Partey -- to individual brilliance and randomness, as evidenced by their combined xG of 0.11. Take them out of the mix as things beyond a manager's control and it's a 2-1 defeat rather than a 5-1 away defeat against the second-placed team in the table, which isn't terrible.\n\nBut if you did that, you'd be deluded. The real concern is that Manchester City managed a single shot on goal -- Erling Haaland's equalizer -- in the second half. More than the five goals, that's the humiliation: one of football's greatest attackers reduced to this. You have to try really, really hard to be this bad.\n\nYou can deal with folks making mistakes because they try something difficult or risky or simply because they're not that good. The chances City gifted Arsenal in the first half fall into those categories. What is harder to deal with is the futility we saw after the break, whether from Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva -- who are supposed to be leaders on this team -- or from Omar Marmoush, who basically disappeared after the break. Yeah, you win and lose as a team and Pep Guardiola gets paid the big bucks to bear the responsibility, but he was let down on Sunday, and it's not the usual scapegoats (Stefan Ortega and Manuel Akanji) who need to be held to account.\n\n? GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe curious thing with City is this feels like a total collapse of planning. If the squad really is weary at this stage, you would think they'd use January to pick up guys who could have an immediate impact to ensure a Champions League run and a top four/five finish. Instead, they spent $150m on two youngsters (Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov) who are long-term projects and Marmoush, a guy who may be a one-season (or even half-season) wonder.\n\nHow does that help Guardiola, whose long-term future remains unclear? Who is green-lighting these vast expenses when Hugo Viana isn't taking over as Sporting Director until the summer? And if they miss out on the Champions League and have the 115 charges still hanging over them, how much harder is it going to be to attract talent for the inevitable rebuild?\n\nSo many questions, nobody to answer them.\n\nplay 2:26 Marcotti: Arsenal title hopes rest on Havertz fitness Gabriele Marcotti believes Arsenal's titles hopes are very dependent on keeping Kai Havertz fit for the rest of the season.\n\nAs for Arsenal, the boost is psychological as much as anything. They weren't exceptional, but they didn't need to be, and they still scored five against the champions while showcasing two more exciting teenagers.\n\nAnd while Kai Havertz missed an absolute sitter and continues to be under fire from some, it's worth noting that he has scored more league goals in fewer games from open play this season than Ollie Watkins, the guy many thought should replace him.\n\nInter is now streets ahead of Milan after their late but fully deserved equalizer\n\nDerbies have outsized importance in Milan. Had Samuel Chukwueze tracked back properly, Nicola Zalewski would not have chested the ball into Stefan de Vrij's path for Inter's injury-time equalizer. And S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, for all of AC Milan's issues, could gloat about winning two derbies in less than a month.\n\nExcept it didn't work out that way. Rather than gloating, the Milan boss needs to roll up his sleeves. Relative to the Champions League horror show in Zagreb last week, he did get a reaction in terms of effort, but Milan were still outplayed. Inter's xG was considerably higher, they hit the woodwork twice and had a cast-iron penalty appeal (Strahinja Pavlovic on Marcus Thuram) ignored by the referee. Inter's intensity and relentlessness, even when not everything is clicking as it should, is exactly what Conceicao says is missing from his Milan team.\n\nThe arrival of Santiago Gim\u00e9nez should help, but probably only in the medium-term: It's a big transition from the Eredivisie to Serie A, especially for a forward. Making his debut, Kyle Walker was marginally better than the guys he was brought in to replace, but that's not saying much. In addition to obsessing over getting a tune out of Rafael Le\u00e3o and Theo Hern\u00e1ndez, Conceicao needs to fix the midfield, because as we saw Sunday, without Youssouf Fofana (suspended) they simply get overrun.\n\nAs for Inter, it feels like two points dropped. The good news is that Hakan Calhanoglou is back and Napoli also dropped points. This team has the experience, quality and depth to win Serie A. On Sunday, they showed again that they have the mentality to do it.\n\nLiverpool get more than a hint of good luck vs. Bournemouth\n\nplay 1:26 Michallik: Liverpool are a team that never panics Luis Miguel Echegaray is joined Janusz Michallik to give their immediate reaction to Liverpool's hard-fought win over Bournemouth.\n\nOn Saturday, Liverpool got a 2-0 road win against a form side that hadn't lost since November, so you can only be happy in terms of results. You're still six points clear at the top, with a game in hand. But in terms of what actually happened in the 2-0 win at Bournemouth, this could have easily gone the other way.\n\nThe Lewis Cook-on-Cody Gakpo penalty that yielded Mo Salah's opener was soft. Salah's strike that put the game away was genius, which is why Slot talked about how grateful he was to have him on board. Bournemouth also hit the woodwork twice and forced a couple of superb saves from Alisson, and Justin Kluivert somehow missed an open goal sitter.\n\nDoes this foreshadow some kind of drop-off, especially with the rescheduled Merseyside derby and an upcoming trip to the Etihad to face Manchester City? Potentially. You have to go back in time to find the last truly impressive Liverpool win against a top opponent, and some of these guys have played a ton of minutes. If you're glass-half-empty, you may find some battle-weariness, which isn't great since we have four months of the campaign to go.\n\nOn the flip side, Slot has scarcely made a wrong step. And the good news is that Liverpool won't be playing Bournemouth -- a side that's giving everyone fits -- until next season. That said, you can be sure Slot is working to figure things out.\n\nReal Madrid dominate, but referee calls go against them\n\nplay 1:07 Real Madrid's outlook after 'disappointing' Espanyol loss Gemma Soler breaks down Real Madrid's disappointing defeat and what it means moving forward.\n\nThe last thing LaLiga needs is its biggest club complaining about referee persecution. Not just because of Real Madrid's history and dominance, but because conspiracy theories are never good for business. And in the week that the president of the Spanish FA revealed that club boss Florentino Perez wants him to bring in English referees, LaLiga certainly didn't need a controversial call.\n\nAnd yet, that's what they got.\n\nReal Madrid were dominant away to Espanyol, hitting the woodwork three times, and limiting the opposition to 0.18 xG and one shot on target until five minutes from time, when Carlos Romero capped off a well-executed transition by scoring the only goal of the game.\n\nThe problem? Not long before, Romero had hacked down Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 from behind as he ran down the flank. The referee pulled a yellow when many would have expected a red. This only fueled conspiracy speculations, since it followed the Vin\u00edcius goal that was disallowed in the first half for a foul by Mbappe who appeared to many to simply free himself from an opponent's hold.\n\nI've made this point before, and it stands. It's not a good look for Real Madrid -- the richest, best-supported, most successful club in Spain -- to needle match officials in this way, especially when they do it preventatively by house organ Real Madrid TV. That said, Saturday felt like two points dropped through bad officiating. A stopped clock is right twice a day.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n10. Simeone hits 500 and Atletico Madrid hit form just in time for the derby: Diego Simeone, taking charge of his 500th Liga game (eighth-most, but unlike the others, all with the same club), guided Atletico Madrid to a 2-0 win over Mallorca that confirms his team's state of grace. It's not so much that they've won 18 of their last 20 games in all competitions, but more the fact that when called upon, the right people are stepping up at the right time. On Saturday, it was Koke, Alexander Sorloth and Samuel Lino who answered the call, which only serves to further underscore just how deep this team is. With the Madrid derby -- and a chance to go to the top -- a week away, the only stain on his weekend was Robin Le Normand's caution, which means he'll be suspended for the Real Madrid game.\n\n9. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on fire for PSG as Luis Enrique does things his way: The word \"fluid front three\" is a bugbear of mine, but with Paris Saint-Germain and Luis Enrique, it makes sense. Bradley Barcola, Ousmane Dembele and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (making his PSG debut) really did play that way for the hour or so they were on the pitch together in the 5-2 away win against Brest. It takes a lot of effort and a lot of time on the training pitch to build the necessary chemistry. But if anyone has the doggedness and vision to make it work -- as well as the string of not-so-critical league games in which to learn how to do it -- it's Luis Enrique.\n\n8. Lamine Yamal's highlight moment overshadows routine 1-0 win over Alaves: This wasn't the sort of performance to write home about, but against a parked bus -- and with a bit of fatigue after their Champions League exertions on Wednesday -- you're not going to blame Barcelona for not running up the score. The fact that Alaves managed an xG of just 0.09 tells its own story. The highlight for me wasn't Robert Lewandowski's tap-in, though we should note he's up to 30 goals this season and it's still early February -- not bad for a 36-year-old. No, it was Lamine Yamal's early run, an absurd combination of technique, awareness, athleticism, strength and balance. On the Gab + Juls show, Julien Laurens and I debated whether it was reminiscent of Lionel Messi or George Weah. The fact that it called to mind both players tells you just how special Yamal is. And he's still too young to vote.\n\n7. Vincent Kompany's Bayern Munich need to grow up: Sometimes the \"maturity\" card gets played unfairly. Not here. You can't be 4-0 up at home against the second-bottom team in the league and concede three times, squeaking a 4-3 win. It's just not what grown-up clubs of Bayern's magnitude do. Bayern started slow, could have easily gone down a goal early, dominated for a long-stretch and then suffered a late defensive collapse with those two injury time goals. The result was never really in peril, but the damage done to the confidence in this team is real.\n\nGAB & JULS PODCAST Gabriele Marcotti and Julien Laurens dive into the latest news and gossip, analyze matches with special guests, and give their perspective on the world of football.

And given that 4-1 victory over Empoli was only their second of 2025, that's not nothing. Still, you need to take it with a pinch of salt. Yes, it's nice that Kolo Muani bagged two goals, but the first came after his opponent crumpled to the ground and he shot from three yards out, while the second consisted of Tim Weah's shot deflecting off him and into the net when his back was turned. Juve's other two goals came in injury time. I'm not a Renato Veiga guy, and even less of a Lloyd Kelly guy, and I hate seeing Dusan Vlahovic come off the bench (though maybe his goal will change that). In other words, I'm confused as you are about Thiago Motta and what he's trying to do.\n\n5. Borussia Dortmund still have plenty at stake for Kovac: If you wanted to be really cynical, you might suggest that the players wanted to look their best for incoming boss Niko Kovac, who takes over Monday. Whatever the case, they dominated for long stretches in the 2-1 win over Heidenheim and served up a reminder that, for all their ills, there is still a lot of talent here. Sure, they're in the bottom half of the table, but they're just five points from the top four and are still alive in Europe. Kovac's tenure can't be seen as some sort of long-term rebuilding. There are goals to reach in the present, and they have the tools to do it.\n\nplay 1:08 Why Antonio Conte will be angry over Napoli's draw with Roma Gab Marcotti explains why Napoli manager Antonio Conte will be unhappy after his club surrendered a late goal to Roma.\n\n4. Napoli drop points at Roma and only have themselves to blame: Manager Antonio Conte tried to put a brave face on it, noting that Roma's celebrations after Angeli\u00f1o's injury time equalizer made it 1-1 somehow showed how feared and respected his Napoli side are. Maybe it was a way to distract from the fact that Napoli really should have done better. Yes, Roma away is a tough out, but the game was sandwiched between a key Europa League match and the Coppa Italia quarterfinal against Milan on Wednesday, and so Claudio Ranieri left no fewer than six regulars on the bench, including Paulo Dybala, Artem Dovbyk, Lorenzo Pellegrini and Leandro Paredes. Napoli took a first-half lead and then wilted, managing just two shots (total xG of 0.09) in the second half. Some blame fatigue, but it's hard to accept when this team gets a week-long break in between each game. Others blame lack of depth; again, hard to swallow when you consider they had Gio Simeone, Giacomo Raspadori, Cyril Ngonge, Billy Gilmour and Philip Billing on the bench -- the last three being Conte signings. It's OK to say you get it wrong sometimes.\n\nplay 1:47 Can Tottenham's win against Brentford turn their season around? Janusz Michallik reacts to Tottenham's 2-0 win away at Brentford in the Premier League.\n\n3. Tottenham finally win, and do it by playing the opposite of \"Angeball:\" I know the clich\u00e9 -- a win is a win, especially when you haven't had one in the league since mid-December -- and we can praise Spurs' resilience and effort despite the long list of injured and unavailable players. But Sunday's 2-0 away victory over Brentford should fool nobody. The home side had the upper hand and created plenty more chances. Tottenham looked nothing like an Ange Postecoglou team (no judgement here, just noting how they were on the back foot for much of the game), and the opener was a gift from the opposition keeper. It's three points and you'll take them, but we'll need to see something different if they're going to scale their way up the table and, more importantly, lay the foundation for something better next season.\n\n2. Boniface is back with a bang, but Leverkusen need to check themselves: They're rolling along nicely. Sunday's 3-1 win over Hoffenheim was their 13th of the last 15 games and they're second in the Bundesliga table -- but there are lessons to be learned for Xabi Alonso's crew. They could have killed this game off early, but, instead, with the help of Alex Grimaldo's sending off, they risked letting Hoffenheim back in. That's something they need to fix. The additions of Emi Buendia (unlucky to be subbed off after the red card) and Mario Hermoso add depth, though what really moves the needle is the return from injury of Victor Boniface, who got on the scoresheet too. Last year, they came within a whisker of a historic Treble. That probably won't happen this season, but they'll go deep -- provided they don't beat themselves.\n\nplay 1:39 Ogden: PSR may trump Amorim over Garnacho future Mark Ogden believes Ruben Amorim wants Alejandro Garnacho to stay at Manchester United however the board are open to selling the forward.\n\n1. I was kinda half-joking when I said Man United should tank the league and focus on the cups: And yet, that's maybe what Ruben Amorim is doing? Go past the headline (embarrassing as it is) of the 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace -- who have five defeats in their last six league games at Old Trafford -- and consider instead his decision to start Kobbie Mainoo at center forward (and, by extension, Bruno Fernandes in midfield). What if this is what he's actually doing? Experimenting in the league knowing they won't be relegated and, realistically, won't be qualifying for the Champions League? Putting all the eggs instead on winning the Europa League and the FA Cup? He won't -- and can't -- admit it, but it wouldn't necessarily be a bad decision, provided it helps him assess his squad and gives him the answers he needs to rebuild in the summer.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nVideo Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in the Premier League, but how are decisions made, and are they correct?\n\nAfter each weekend we take a look at the major incidents to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\n\nIn this week's VAR Review: Why Liverpool's penalty at AFC Bournemouth was allowed to stand, why Aston Villa's \"equalizer\" at Wolves was ruled out for offside, and comparing a possible penalty for Brighton to another conceded by Arsenal's William Saliba.\n\nPossible penalty overturn: Foul by Cook on Gakpo\n\nWhat happened: Andrew Robertson played a ball through the center for Cody Gakpo to run on to in the 27th minute. As the Liverpool forward got into the area, he went down and appealed for a penalty after contact by Lewis Cook. Referee Darren England pointed to the spot and it was checked by the VAR, John Brooks.\n\nVAR decision: Penalty stands, scored by Mohamed Salah.\n\nVAR review: It's the decision that raised the most questions over the weekend, but once contact had been identified, there was no prospect of a VAR overturn.\n\nThe rearview replay showed that Cook had knocked Gakpo's left boot with his left leg when running across, which led the Netherlands international to clip his own heels and go down.\n\nLewis Cook clips Cody Gakpo's left foot, causing the Liverpool player to fall over. BBC\n\nWe've seen a number of similar penalties given on the field in recent seasons, most notably in February 2021, when Arsenal's David Luiz was judged to have caused Wolverhampton Wanderers attacker Willian Jose to go down when through on goal.\n\nAlso, a month earlier in that season, Paul Pogba was awarded a penalty for Manchester United at home to Aston Villa when his trailing leg was clipped by Douglas Luiz.\n\nVilla boss Dean Smith insisted Pogba had \"tripped himself\" -- which was also the original claim about the Gakpo spot kick -- but the VAR had evidence of a touch on Pobga's boot as Luiz tried to close down space around the France international.\n\nDouglas Luiz made contact with Paul Pogba, leading to a penalty for Manchester United vs. Aston Villa. BBC\n\nLuiz was sent off for his challenge, as Jose was through on goal. While Gakpo might have been about to shoot, he was out wide on the field and probably wasn't in a strong enough position for this to be deemed an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.\n\nVerdict: Edge cases such as this always raise questions about how VAR allows inconsistency to fester, because if the referee hadn't given this as a penalty, the VAR wouldn't have stepped in.\n\nIt's not a \"clear and obvious\" error to give a penalty when there's the evidence that Cook caused Gakpo to lose his footing. However, because it was difficult to immediately identify the contact and with no challenge being made, it also wouldn't be a \"clear and obvious\" error to allow play to continue.\n\nBonus bit\n\nIt was deep into stoppage time when the referee dropped the ball for Curtis Jones to restart play just outside the center circle. The Liverpool midfielder didn't touch the ball, and it was stolen off him by Marcus Tavernier. The Bournemouth player dribbled upfield and fired a shot over the bar.\n\nShould Tavernier have been allowed to do this? And would the goal have stood if the shot had gone in?\n\nOn a dropped ball, it's live as soon as it touches the ground. There's no requirement for a player on the receiving team to touch it for play to be active.\n\nMarcus Tavernier steals the ball off Curtis Jones on a Liverpool dropped ball. BBC\n\nIf an opponent is the necessary four meters away when the ball hits the ground, they are within their rights to challenge and, as Tavernier did, steal the ball.\n\nHowever, had Tavernier scored, it could only count as a goal if goalkeeper Alisson Becker had gotten a touch, or if it had taken a deflection. That's because if a dropped ball enters the goal without touching at least two players, play is restarted with a goal kick. Tavernier also could have made a pass, and it would be a goal. If so, there would have been no VAR intervention and the goal would have correctly stood.\n\nplay 1:26 Michallik: Liverpool are a team that never panics Luis Miguel Echegaray is joined Janusz Michallik to give their immediate reaction to Liverpool's hard-fought win over Bournemouth.\n\nPossible goal: Subjective offside against Rogers on Semedo\n\nWhat happened: Aston Villa thought they had an equalizer in the 54th minute when a short free kick was played along the ground and into the area to John McGinn, who squared for Donyell Malen to net from close range. However, the assistant raised his flag immediately for offside in the buildup against Morgan Rogers. It was checked by the VAR, Matt Donohue.\n\nVAR decision: No goal.\n\nVAR review: When goals are disallowed for such offences, there's usually a misconception that it's for a foul. Indeed, Wolves have already benefited in such circumstances this season, when a Southampton goal was chalked off for a foul by Mateus Fernandes on N\u00e9lson Semedo in November.\n\nRather than being a foul, this is interference from an offside position. The bar is much lower, as a player simply isn't allowed to influence play or impact an opponent when they were offside.\n\nRogers was clearly offside when the free kick was taken, so the VAR must consider the level of interference by the Aston Villa player on Wolves defender Semedo.\n\nRogers ran behind Semedo and came into contact with the Portugal international, but Semedo then moved to try to stop the delivery from McGinn and got there just too late.\n\nDonohue must ask whether Rogers' actions impacted Semedo's ability to challenge for the ball and, as he was the one to attempt to cut out the cross, it can't be seen as a \"clear and obvious\" on-field error.\n\nThe replay from behind the goal shows Rogers put an arm in the back of Semedo. This couldn't be seen as a foul, but it can be seen as impacting play from an offside position.\n\nIn November, Southampton had a goal from Cameron Archer ruled out by the on-field officials at Brighton because an offside Adam Armstrong had attempted to flick at the ball. The Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel ruled that while that goal should have counted, it wasn't a clear enough error for VAR to get involved and overturn the offside.\n\nArguably, there are similarities in the level of the offside offence committed by Rogers, but this one is likely to be judged as correct on the field, too.\n\nHowever, the VAR's decision to disallow Nikola Milenkovic's goal for Nottingham Forest against Southampton last month was logged as an error by the KMI Panel, as it was deemed Chris Wood did not obviously impact an opponent within the move.\n\nVerdict: It's perhaps a harsh decision and, like the Liverpool penalty, one that may not have come via a VAR intervention -- but it's not going to be changed on review, either.\n\nReferee Andy Madley didn't need to go to the pitchside monitor to assess the subjective offside because the decision had been given on the field. He would have viewed it himself only had the VAR felt the goal should be allowed to stand.\n\nMorgan Rogers engaged with N\u00e9lson Semedo after the free kick had been taken to John McGinn. BBC\n\nPossible foul in the buildup to Cunha goal: Bueno challenge on Rogers\n\nWhat happened: Santiago Bueno tackled Rogers deep inside his own half in the sixth minute of stoppage time, with the Aston Villa player going to ground. Hwang Hee-Chan picked up the loose ball and played a pass over the top, which Matheus Cunha ran on to and scored. But was there a case for a foul in the buildup?\n\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\n\nVAR review: As the challenge led to Wolves gaining possession and scoring pretty much immediately, the goal could have been ruled out through a VAR review.\n\nThe key aspect for the VAR was that Bueno clearly won the ball; while there was contact with Rogers, it was not enough for an overturn in the Premier League.\n\nIndeed, Villa conceded a goal against Nottingham Forest in similar circumstances in December, when Elliot Anderson challenged Matty Cash just before Anthony Elanga scored a stoppage-time winner. The KMI Panel unanimously voted it was a correct decision on the field and in the VAR room not to give a foul.\n\nSantiago Bueno got a clear touch on the ball on his challenge on Morgan Rogers leading to Wolves' second goal. BBC\n\nVerdict: In Europe's other top leagues, with a lower threshold for a foul, this may well have been ruled out on review. But as the Premier League encourages a greater level of physicality, an intervention wouldn't be expected.\n\nPossible penalty: Challenge by Milenkovic on Welbeck\n\nWhat happened: Brighton & Hove Albion were on the attack in the 57th minute when Danny Welbeck went to ground after a clash of heads with Nottingham Forest defender Nikola Milenkovic. Referee Simon Hooper allowed play to continue before stopping it for the head injury. The VAR, Paul Tierney, checked for a possibility penalty.\n\nVAR decision: No penalty.\n\nDanny Welbeck caused a clash of heads with Nottingham Forest defender Nikola Milenkovic. OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVAR review: This incident was always likely to lead to comparisons with the spot kick awarded to Brighton against Arsenal last month, when Saliba was penalized for trying to win the ball but headed the face of Jo\u00e3o Pedro.\n\nWhile Welbeck was the player down holding his head, it was the Brighton striker who caused the clash as he moved his head backwards to prepare to control a bouncing ball.\n\nVerdict: There was no movement by Milenkovic to head the ball, unlike with the Saliba example, so it was correct both on the field and through VAR not to give a penalty.\n\nPossible penalty overturn: Foul by Lamptey on Gibbs-White\n\nWhat happened: Nottingham Forest were awarded a penalty in the 68th minute when Morgan Gibbs-White was wrestled to the ground by Tariq Lamptey, and referee Hooper pointed to the spot. It was checked by the VAR (watch here).\n\nVAR decision: Penalty stands, scored by Chris Wood.\n\nTariq Lamptey is holding on to Morgan Gibbs-White with both arms. BBC\n\nVAR review: Lamptey had both arms around Gibbs-White and had no interest in trying to challenge for the ball. It was a clear non-footballing action, and Gibbs-White did not get involved in mutual holding, so there was no prospect of a VAR intervention.\n\nIndeed, attackers have more chance of winning a decision if they actively do not engage with the defender -- otherwise it could be seen as holding offences by both players.\n\nVerdict: With the amount of holding going on in penalty areas this season, there should be more spot kicks given for this kind of action.\n\nIndeed, all three missed penalty interventions logged by the KMI Panel this campaign have been for holding: Elliott Anderson on Morgan Rogers (Forest vs. Villa), Alexis Mac Allister on Carlos Soler (West Ham United vs. Liverpool), and Wes Burns on Jan Paul van Hecke (Ipswich Town vs. Brighton.)\n\nPossible handball: Sangar\u00e9 before Williams goal\n\nWhat happened: Forest scored a sixth goal in the 89th minute after a goalmouth scramble saw Ibrahim Sangar\u00e9 fall on the ball before Neco Williams scored. There was a possible handball offence by Sangar\u00e9 (watch here).\n\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\n\nIbrahim Sangar\u00e9 landed on the ball, but this would only be an offence if he was the goal scorer. BBC\n\nVAR review: The law which covers accidental handball before a goal was changed a few years ago to apply only to the goal scorer.\n\nSo had Sangar\u00e9 got up and scored the goal, it would have been ruled out. But as it fell to Williams, the goal stands.\n\nArsenal's Kai Havertz saw what would have been a late winner against Aston Villa ruled out for accidental handball last month, when it deflected in off his arm. If, for example, the ball had come off the crossbar and a teammate had followed up to score, the goal would have counted.\n\nVerdict: The goal could have been ruled out only had there been a deliberate handball offence by Sangar\u00e9, but it appeared to hit him in the armpit area before coming off his arm as he landed.\n\nPossible penalty: Challenge by Vestergaard on Beto\n\nWhat happened: James Garner played a through-ball to Beto in the 34th minute. Jannik Vestergaard came across to make a challenge and appeared to bundle into the Everton striker. Referee Darren Bond waved away the penalty claims and play continued. It was looked at by the VAR, Stuart Attwell.\n\nVAR decision: No penalty.\n\nBeto is challenged by Leicester City's Jannik Vestergaard. Peter Byrne/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nVAR review: This could have gone either way on the field.\n\nBeto looked to latch on to the pass and Vestergaard came in with a strong challenge from the side which, on another day, could have been seen as a foul.\n\nVerdict: A classic case of a challenge that isn't going to be given as a penalty through VAR in the Premier League, but wouldn't be overturned if it was given.\n\nManchester United wanted a spot kick against Manchester City in December for a similar sort of tackle by R\u00faben Dias on Rasmus H\u00f8jlund. The KMI Panel voted 3-2 that the referee was correct not to give the spot, and 4-1 that it shouldn't be a VAR intervention.\n\nPossible penalty: Collins challenge on Moore\n\nWhat happened: Tottenham Hotspur broke forward in the 34th minute, with Dejan Kulusevski feeding Mikey Moore inside the area. The Spurs forward went down under pressure from Nathan Collins, but referee Jarred Gillett ignored appeals for a penalty.\n\nVAR decision: No penalty.\n\nMikey Moore goes down too easily after feeling Nathan Collins place arms on him. Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images\n\nVAR review: It was a quick check from the VAR, Graham Scott.\n\nWhen Moore received the ball, two hands were on him from the Brentford defender. However, the attacker seemed to go to ground very easily after feeling Collins' contact.\n\nVerdict: The defender clearly took a risk, but no penalty was the correct outcome from the VAR.\n\nSome factual parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBarcelona suffered their first defeat in Liga F this season. Oscar J. Barroso/Europa Press via Getty Images\n\nAnother weekend of women's football is in the books and there were a few surprises, a few surprises that nearly came off, and a belter or two.\n\nThe big news came from Spain's Liga F where, after a season and a half, Barcelona finally lost a league game as they ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 scoreline against strugglers Levante.\n\nThe Women's Super League (WSL) started with a nail-biting 4-3 thriller between Manchester City and Arsenal, and finished with a less-than-classic 1-0 win for Manchester United against Tottenham. In between, Crystal Palace fought back away to Brighton to pick up a valuable point after a 1-1 draw, Everton thumped Leicester 4-1, Liverpool bested West Ham for the second time in four days, and leaders Chelsea just about got the better of Aston Villa, 1-0.\n\nIn Germany, Eintracht Frankfurt kept their spot at the summit of the Frauen-Bundesliga table with a cagey 2-1 win over fellow title-hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen, before Larissa M\u00fchlhaus put in a glittering solo performance for mid-table Werder Bremen in their 4-1 thrashing of Turbine Potsdam.\n\nOver in Serie A, Juventus' unexpected 1-1 draw at home to Napoli has slightly reduced the gap at the top of the table for the league leaders, who have Inter Milan snapping at their heels. While in France, Paris Saint-Germain were given a helping hand in what could have been tricky game against Strasbourg as a second-half own goal was enough for the visitors to seal a 2-1 win.\n\nBarcelona finally lose\n\nAfter a run of 46 league games without defeat (featuring just one draw), stretching back 622 days, Barcelona suffered a rare defeat and their first-ever loss at the Estadi Johan Cruyff (where they've been playing since 2019.) Incredibly, rather than a loss against a team fighting for a Champions League spot, it came against one fighting against relegation: Levante.\n\nIt was not the first wobble of Pere Romeu's first season in charge, with Barcelona having been made to work hard against Sevilla in September, Valencia in December and even last time out against Athletic Club. And, strangely, it was one of Barcelona's most dominant performances, with the hosts managing 47 total shots (which drew 11 saves from Andrea Tarazona) as well as 13 blocks from the visitors.\n\nLevante didn't sit deep in a low block and try to deny Barcelona passing options, in fact the Catalans had little problem moving the ball about and were happy to take shots from inside the box as well as out. But for all those 47 efforts, other than Fridolina Rolf\u00f6's stoppage-time consolation and a pair that struck the woodwork, their finishing wasn't the best. Mar\u00eda de Alharilla's 50th-minute effort pinged from one post to the other before kissing into the net and, as Barcelona camped out in the final third, it was a gut-busting stoppage-time dash from Ivonne Chac\u00f3n that brought about the 94th-minute winner, before Rolf\u00f6's late goal and Ainhoa Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n's even later red card.\n\nAlthough losing, not least domestically, has become quite the rarity for Barcelona, it's the type of match that can be written off as just not their day. The perennial champions do still have a comfortable eight-point buffer between themselves and nearest rivals, Real Madrid, who they only just pasted 5-0 in the Supercopa. So, maybe it's not quite time to panic yet. -- SL\n\nArsenal thriller compounds City misery\n\nWith City and Arsenal having been embroiled in one of the transfer window's most explosive sagas, it was only right their latest showdown on the pitch was box office entertainment.\n\nChloe Kelly -- who joined Arsenal on loan from City on deadline day -- was ineligible to feature against her parent club. But there was no shortage of attacking prowess on show at the Joie Stadium, with Arsenal ultimately edging this seven-goal thriller.\n\nIt was a result that compounded what has been a damaging few weeks for City. While Kelly's desire to leave and her eventual exit have dominated headlines off the pitch, Gareth Taylor's side have toiled on it, losing back-to-back league games against Everton and Manchester United.\n\nCity's title hopes now lie in tatters -- with leaders Chelsea 12 points ahead of them after winning at Aston Villa - - and manager Taylor conceded after the match that his side are in need of a pick-me-up.\n\nFor Arsenal, however, it's another tick against the name of head coach Renee Slegers. With Kelly yet to star for the first-team, their attack is only set to get stronger in the months ahead. -- BL\n\nMan United grind out another win\n\nAs legendary Manchester United men's boss Sir Alex Ferguson once said: \"Attack wins you games, defence wins you titles.\"\n\nWhile United might struggle to get their hands on the WSL trophy this term -- they remain seven points behind leaders Chelsea -- they proved once again on Sunday why they have the meanest defence in the league, battling to a 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nUnited took the lead inside six minutes when Norway international Elisabeth Terland expertly diverted Jayde Riviere's sublime cross into the back of the net. Marc Skinner's side dominated the contest for much of the first half, though failed to find that killer second goal and had to remain resolute to keep Spurs at bay after the interval.\n\nThat they managed to do so is evidence of why, after 13 games played, they remain Chelsea's closest challengers in the title race. It was United's fifth consecutive win, against a Spurs team that were unbeaten in four games.\n\n\"What I love about this team is we have the true DNA of a Man United team,\" Skinner said after the match.\n\nAlthough that is unlikely to be enough to see them usurp Chelsea as champions this term, it certainly looks like United are building solid foundations for success. -- BL\n\nplay 1:09 Laurens: Chelsea to be 'invincible' after Girma and Walsh signings Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens react to reports of Keira Walsh's return to the WSL to join Chelsea.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\nEIGHT. The stuff of champions. Champions make their own luck and to win titles, teams need to find ways to win ugly. For everything Emma Hayes did for Chelsea during her decade with the Blues, instilling a 'keep believing' attitude is a key part of her legacy. Against Villa, Chelsea were not at their best but -- as they've moved to embrace Bompastorball -- they make things happen. Mayra Ram\u00edrez's sprint down the right flank and Maika Hamano's ghosting run behind Sarah Mayling saw the defender accidently send the ball spinning into the back of Sabrina D'Angelo's net in the 82nd minute. And it goes down as another win.\n\nSEVEN. Everything's comin' up M\u00fchlhaus. After several seasons scrapping lower down the table, Werder Bremen have found themselves in the heady midtable wasteland with no threat of relegation but little chance of upsetting the top of the table. That, however, hasn't stopped them from putting in some memorable performances this season, and few will surpass Larissa M\u00fchlhaus's stunning 90 minutes in Potsdam. The heart and soul of everything Bremen did well, M\u00fchlhaus opened the scoring with a sublime curling free kick and then bagged two more to complete her hat trick.\n\nSIX. Toffees find their joy. Everton have had better seasons, the Toffees lost Inma Gabarro and Aurora Galli to ACL injuries in consecutive weeks at the start of the season and the turn of the year has only brought about more injury misery, with defender and captain Megan Finnigan sidelined with her own ACL injury. As well as long-term issues, manager Brian S\u00f8rensen has had to contest with niggles to the rest of his squad and a small budget to work with. Yet, Sunday's 4-1 win over Leicester City brought about something not often seen at Walton Hall Park: joyful attacking football from the hosts. There was a flow about how Everton attacked, with Toni Payne and winter signing Kelly Gago driving the team forward with some clean interplay from the attacking line. For the first time in a long time, it felt like the Toffees had finally left their sticky patch behind.\n\nSTREAM FUTBOL W ON ESPN+ Ali Krieger and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights from women's soccer in the Americas. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\n\nFIVE. Napoli dig deep. Even after giving up two points to a stubborn Napoli, Juventus still have a buffer at the top of the Serie A table but, not for the first time this season, the Bianconere have wavered a little more than expected. Of the six games Juve have played this calendar year, only three have been won. And, after an unexpected (but ultimately, not costly) Copa Italia loss to Lazio on Thursday, Massimiliano Canzi would have wanted a better response from his side, who created plenty but found their finishing wanting.\n\nFOUR. Kiernan up and running for the season. 6\u00bd years after moving to the WSL [first with West Ham, now Liverpool], it's safe to say Leanne Kiernan's time in England has been rather stop-start, with the attacker plagued by injuries, and that is part of the reason why her goal return pales in comparison to her rivals. We are halfway through the WSL season and Kiernan was still waiting for her first goal of the campaign but, fresh off scoring against West Ham in the League Cup on Wednesday, the Republic of Ireland international fired in her first league goal since May with a deft flick to seal the win over her old team. Liverpool will be hoping the floodgates are once again open for the 25-year-old.\n\nTHREE. Frankfurt stay the course. The moment of the match between Frankfurt and Leverkusen might have come from Leverkusen's Kar\u00f3l\u00edna Lea Vilhj\u00e1lmsd\u00f3ttir when the Bayern loanee found the top corner from 30 yards out but, once again, it was Eintracht who put in a composed 90-minute performance. On paper, SGE still pale in comparison to reigning champions Bayern Munich [who sit below the Eagles on goal difference alone] but watching Eintracht there's a growing sense that they can upset the applecart. Once one of Germany's greatest teams [in their previous incarnation as FFC Frankfurt], the rise of more traditional powers saw Frankfurt drop off, but this season the momentum and belief is growing.\n\nTWO. Eagles keep fighting. Surviving in the WSL is no easy thing for a team in their debut season, but there's no question that Crystal Palace have consistently improved each match week. And, after a spirited fightback against Spurs last weekend only to lose in the 95 minute, the Eagles were back at it against Brighton on Sunday. Down early on to an unfortunate Lily Woodham own goal, the visitors worked their way back into the game to mount a late charge, with Mi Cato smashing home an equaliser in the 88th-minute. Although Palace remain rooted to the bottom of the table, there should be a renewed sense of belief heading into the second half of the season.\n\nONE. Strasbourg lose but it's not all doom and gloom. Laurine Hannequin's unfortunate own goal was ultimately the deciding factor when Strasbourg clashed with PSG, as the 21-year-old's header was sandwiched between Rom\u00e9e Leuchter's opener and Liana Joseph's stoppage-time consolation on her debut for Racing. There are however, positives for the hosts to take, not least setting a new attendance record of 13,613 (smashing their previous of 1,805). As well as Joseph's debut, Racing have \u00c8ve P\u00e9risset incoming, as well as a solid base they can keep building on. Yes, they were outplayed by PSG, but that was never going to be where their season is won or lost. It is how they handle themselves against those around them: the likes of Le Havre, Stade de Reims and Guingamps. -- SL",

                "text": "We're nearly at the end of 2020, which means it's time for ESPN's annual ranking of the best men's players and coaches in world soccer! Welcome to the FC 100.\n\nThis year, our fifth edition of the countdown has a lot of surprises and new faces -- more on that later -- as well as two teams rising above the rest to dominate the list. As always, our list is broken down into 10 Top 10s for every position on the pitch as well as managers, making for the most meaningful and deep look at the talent across the men's game from goalkeeper to striker.\n\nJump to: Goalkeepers | Right-back | Centre-back | Left-back | Central midfield | Attacking midfield | Wing | Forward | Striker | Manager\n\nRead the FC 100 in: Spanish | Portuguese\n\nPrevious editions of the FC 100: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016\n\nThe top spots were dominated by two clubs: Bayern Munich, winners of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League, and Liverpool, winners of their first league title in 30 years. They claimed every No. 1 spot except for two, ATTACKING MIDFIELD and FORWARD -- see if you can guess who took those prizes? -- as our voters leaned into their on-field domination.\n\nA couple of other themes emerged in this year's ranking, too:\n\n-- New names, new faces\n\nThis was arguably the most diverse and most refreshed FC 100 since we began in 2016. Nearly half the list -- 47 out of 100 -- were either new to the FC 100 or not ranked in 2019, which reflects not only the challenges of the 2019-20 season amid the coronavirus pandemic but also the turnover of top players and the generational \"passing of the guard\" to a younger group of superstars. Erling Haaland (Borussia Dortmund), Achraf Hakimi (Inter Milan) and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) all pop up after transcendent seasons, as do Leon Goretzka (Bayern), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa) and Houssem Aouar (Lyon).\n\nThis kind of refreshment is exactly what we're seeing in the game as aging legends fade and new stars are made.\n\n-- Americans are back?\n\nIt might not seem like much, but after being shut out in 2019 for many reasons, the USMNT gets two into the 100 this time around: Christian Pulisic returns -- after a stellar 2020 until injuries hit -- and Sergino Dest, a newcomer to the U.S. scene since choosing to rep the Yanks late last year. Dest cracked the Top 10 at right-back after a superb campaign with Ajax, a summer transfer saga with Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and an eventual move to the Spanish giants, where he became the first U.S. player to start in a Clasico, as well as the first American to score a goal for the storied club.\n\nBut enough preamble; here's how we did the list.\n\nTo compile the 2020 edition of the FC 100, 65 ESPN FC experts (from editors to writers, TV talent to former players) from around the world were given a list of about 250 players and managers to make their selections.\n\nHere's the key: We didn't use one megalist with all players mixed together -- such conceits inevitably favor attackers, because everyone loves a good goal, don't they? But that isn't fair to those engaged in the dark arts at the back. So instead, we broke down the world's best players by position in a 4-3-3 formation, plus manager. Each expert then contributed a Top 10 for each category, and we crunched the numbers and did a final review with a select few writers.\n\nAgree with our picks? Disagree? Now comes the fun part. FC 100: It. Is. On.\n\nNOTE: All player ages are as of Nov. 20\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe modern goalkeeper isn't just there to stop shots. He's also the first step in building attacks; whether with a long, accurate throw or a raking crossfield pass, it's the first major evolution for the position since the \"sweeper-keeper\" became a thing thanks to Manuel Neuer. Agility and reflexes are a given, but confidence, vision and assertive play are vital, too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Elaine Teng\n\nClub/country: Man United/Spain\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nDe Gea has been a constant through United's many ups and downs since he joined the club in 2011. He has faced a lot of criticism over the past nine years -- some fans think he should be dropped for 23-year-old Dean Henderson -- but De Gea is tied for the most Premier League clean sheets in United's history (112, shared with Peter Schmeichel) and made the second-most PL appearances (411) between the posts. Last season, only Liverpool and Manchester City conceded fewer goals, a huge part of why the Red Devils managed to finish third despite a poor start.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Between February and July, De Gea kept nine clean sheets -- the most in the league -- to help United go from seventh to third (and likely saving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's job at the same time).\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Slovenia\n\nAge: 36\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nLast season, Inter fell one point short of seizing the Serie A crown from Juventus and made it to the Europa League final. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez got much of the praise, but credit should also go to Handanovic's rock-solid performances between the posts. Inter conceded the fewest goals in the league, and their wily captain kept 13 clean sheets. At 36, his reflexes remain sharp, his presence imposing, and he's super adept at the full-stretch highlight save.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A superb save against Getafe's Nemanja Maksimovic helped Inter through to the Europa League quarterfinal and, ultimately, the final.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/Italy\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nConsider this: Donnarumma made his Serie A debut five years ago, has played over 200 games for Milan and is firmly established as the legendary Gianluigi Buffon's successor for Italy. And he's 21 years old. Despite his club's managerial chaos and financial turmoil, he has been a pillar of calm and consistency, keeping at least 10 clean sheets in each of his five seasons and steadily improving his passing accuracy. The Rossoneri are off to a flying start this term, and the sooner they can tie Donnarumma down -- his contract expires next summer -- the better their chances at long-term success.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the goals in Milan's 2-1 derby win over Inter, but Donnarumma made a key save against Romelu Lukaku in his first game back after testing positive for the coronavirus to cement their victory.\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Costa Rica\n\nAge: 33\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas doesn't get as much attention as many of his colleagues on this list, but that doesn't make him less deserving. At Real Madrid, his teammates used to call him \"Keylor Paras\" (\"Keylor Stops\"), and he's lived up to that name after moving to Paris. In his first season at PSG, he kept five clean sheets -- trailing Bayern's Manuel Neuer by just one despite playing 191 fewer minutes -- to guide his team to the Champions League final. In terms of European success, few can usurp him: He has played in four of the past five Champions League finals -- and won three of them.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Making save after save against Atalanta in the Champions League quarterfinal to keep PSG's hopes alive before Neymar & Co. orchestrated a dramatic late comeback.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nAt his best, Ederson can feel like an extra outfield player who also happens to be fantastic at stopping shots. The perfect keeper for Pep Guardiola's brand of possession-based football, his scarily accurate long balls start many a City attack. City have struggled with injuries and have been uncharacteristically fragile at the back, but last season Ederson still managed to keep 16 clean sheets, earning him the Premier League Golden Glove. As they look to wrest the league title back from Liverpool, City will need him at his best on both offense and defense.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Raheem Sterling scored the winner against Arsenal in October, but Ederson made spectacular saves to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka to get City back on track.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nReal Madrid didn't always look as though they would win the league last season, but Courtois was a giant in goal. He conceded 20 goals in 34 league matches, kept 18 clean sheets and boasted the highest save percentage in La Liga. But he has been known for making some outrageous gaffes now and again. In November, during a Nations League match against Denmark, the Belgian No. 1 let a back pass roll straight past him into goal. If Belgium, the top-ranked team in the world, are to win the Euros next year, Courtois will need all of his focus.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his first La Liga title with Real Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Germany\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nIn September 2019, Ter Stegen rushed out of the penalty area, beat a Getafe attacker to the ball and played a long pass into the opposite box for Luis Suarez to calmly lob into the goal. That assist was classic Ter Stegen, a confident sweeper-keeper who's comfortable with the ball at his feet and can convert saves into counterattacks in a flash. The German doesn't get as much attention in a team full of attacking superstars, but he plays a pivotal role in Ronald Koeman's plans as he looks to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Claiming his second career assist in December 2019, when Antoine Griezmann ran onto his goal kick to score against Mallorca.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/Slovenia\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nIn the six seasons Oblak has tended the Atletico goal, they've conceded fewer than 30 goals each campaign. The efficient, reserved Slovenian is the perfect keeper for Diego Simeone's hardworking, disciplined side. He made nine saves -- more than any keeper in the tournament -- in a man-of-the-match performance away at Liverpool in last season's Champions League to send Atletico through to the quarterfinals. There are more glamorous players in football, but few are as consistent or as effective.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool had 72% possession and 34 shots at the Wanda Metropolitano in March, but they couldn't get past Oblak.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe consummate modern goalkeeper, Alisson can turn defense into offense in the blink of an eye. Equally calm on the ball with his hands and his feet, he was instrumental in Liverpool's charge to their first Premier League trophy in three decades. In January, he even notched an assist when he played a long upfield pass to Mohamed Salah, who made it 2-0 against Manchester United. (Alisson was so delighted he sprinted the length of the pitch, past all of his teammates, to celebrate with the Egypt international.) Liverpool's long injury list this season, especially in central defense, means Alisson is more crucial to their hopes of retaining the title than ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helping Liverpool end their 30-year wait for a Premier League title.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Neuer and Alisson finished tied on overall points after the tallying of ballots, but Neuer was awarded first place by virtue of receiving more first-place votes from the FC voters, with 19 to Alisson's 18.\n\nGermany's sweeper-keeper looked to be slowing down as he reached his mid-30s, but in the past 12 months, the 34-year-old has been back at his imperious best. Seven years since he most recently won a treble with Bayern, Neuer lifted the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies in 2020 as club captain. He made a string of crucial stops in the Champions League final to deny PSG, including a spectacular double save against Neymar. In October, he kept his 200th clean sheet for Bayern, a club record. At times it seems attackers are intimidated just knowing he's in goal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his second Champions League title, though an eighth consecutive Bundesliga trophy is no small feat, either.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nRIGHT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nAt one point, right-backs were considered the least skilled players on the pitch, but the next generation brings boldness and unpredictability. Positional awareness, pinpoint crossing and breakneck pace separate the best from the rest.\n\nPlayer capsules by Stephan Uersfeld\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/United States\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nIt's been an incredible year for the young defender. After just one season and 23 appearances for Ajax's first team since debuting in July 2019, Dest has been on a dizzying upward trajectory, becoming the first American to sign for La Liga giants Barcelona after being involved in a transfer saga that also included Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Not the worst options! The Dutch-born player, capable of playing either full-back position, is considered one of the best young U.S. internationals since committing in October 2019, and he has already shown in four appearances for Barca that he can solve their issues at right-back.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Starting the Clasico, becoming the first American to feature in Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, and even winning Barca's man-of-the-match award in the 3-1 defeat.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nNow in his second La Liga season with Atleti, Trippier has fully embraced his new life away from Tottenham and the Premier League. He's an integral part of Diego Simeone's first XI and has started and finished every match of the 2020-21 season. Playing at right-back at the club level, he's versatile enough to play a more advanced role for England, featuring as a wing-back in Gareth Southgate's 3-4-2-1 formation. Though England have a lot of competition for full-back spots, Trippier's experience, work rate and pinpoint accuracy with crosses could be crucial in the Three Lions' bid to compete at the Euros in the summer.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Trippier's best moment came in a \"return\" to England. In one of the last big matches played in front of fans before the coronavirus shut down the sport, Trippier was instrumental in Atletico's 3-2 win at Liverpool back in March, ably shutting Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson down before coming off in extra time.\n\nClub/country: Leicester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe dynamic defender started all but one of Leicester's 29 Premier League matches before the pandemic, but we're still waiting to see him back in action. His absence due to an ACL injury has been a major challenge for the Foxes, who have missed Pereira's pace and poise on the flank. Before that, Pereira had been involved in 471 duels, more than any other defender across the top five leagues in Europe. Without Pereira, Leicester dropped out of the Champions League spots at the end of the 2019-20 season, proof of his importance to Brendan Rodgers' plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's rare for defenders to show up on the scoresheet, but Pereira put together a superb game against West Ham in January, notching a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Netherlands\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThriving in his role at wing-back for Atalanta, Hateboer was an integral part of one of Europe's most exciting teams last term as the unheralded Italian side came within a late PSG goal of reaching the Champions League semifinals. A force in aerial duels and his side's intricate passing game, he pairs a superhuman work rate with positional intelligence in a demanding position. The 26-year-old was snapped up by Atalanta from Dutch side Groningen for less than a million euros in 2017 and has since become a fixture in the Dutch national team. There's every chance he'll take another step up next summer and move to one of the European giants.\n\nHigh point of 2020: An impressive two-goal performance in the Champions League round of 16, first leg, against Valencia. Not only was it his only game with goals in 2019-20 but it put the tiny Serie A side into the Champions League's last eight in Lisbon.\n\nplay 0:57 Is FC 100 winner Mane the smartest player at Liverpool? Gab Marcotti believes Sadio Mane \"smartness\" is one of the reasons he tops ESPN's FC 100.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Spain\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas didn't hold back his tears when Sevilla won the 2019-20 Europa League in Germany this summer. Having begun his senior career at the club in 2003, winning two UEFA Cups and two Copa del Reys, clinching the Europa League at age 34 was seen as just reward for the Spain international. Indeed, he seemingly has gotten better with age since leaving Manchester City for his boyhood club in 2017.\n\nHigh point of 2020: As team captain, Navas contributed an assist against Inter Milan in the final as Sevilla won the competition for the sixth time since 2005.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nA reliable defender under Pep Guardiola, Walker might not have the attacking power of Trent Alexander-Arnold or Achraf Hakimi, for example, but he's been one of the steadier City performers since joining the club in 2017. On the pitch, he patrols City's right side with high tempo, physicality and an unrivalled intensity. In his 30s and with an apparent leadership void in the City squad since Vincent Kompany's exit, Walker has been a vital lieutenant for Guardiola.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner -- but not celebrating it! -- against one of his former clubs, Sheffield United, in his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nIt's hard to find anyone more consistent at right-back over the past couple of years. He has fended off the threat of losing his place in Madrid's first XI with another outstanding season, looking so good that his presumed replacement, Achraf Hakimi, returned from a loan at Borussia Dortmund only to be sold to Inter Milan. Carvajal isn't a flashy right-back, known more for his work behind the ball, but he's also been a superb support to Karim Benzema whenever he's able to get forward and play crosses into the box. Carvajal was a part of the Real side that won La Liga for the first time since 2016-17, and despite his missing the start of the campaign through injury, his imminent return will boost Zinedine Zidane's squad immensely.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was superb in both Clasico clashes last season, results that played a key role in Real Madrid's title challenge.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPavard is still far from being a household name, though the young defender was arguably Bayern Munich's unsung hero of a Treble-winning season. Having joined from relegated VfB Stuttgart in 2019, he provided the stability at right-back that allowed Joshua Kimmich to move into a permanent defensive midfield role. Less attacking than some of his Bundesliga right-back peers like Hakimi, he still scored four goals and set up seven in all competitions in his debut season at the Allianz Arena. The \u20ac35 million transfer fee for the France defender looks to be a bargain even though his unspectacular style of play gets him few plaudits. Oh, and Pavard is also capable of putting in a shift at centre-back to further enhance Bayern's myriad options.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In his first league match under Hansi Flick, Pavard was superb, notching an assist as Bayern demolished Borussia Dortmund 4-0 midway through last season.\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Morocco\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nA spectacular, adventurous two-way player capable of brilliance on either side of the ball, Hakimi has fast become one of the best right-backs in world soccer. After scoring six goals and providing six assists for Dortmund last season and forming a superb relationship with England star Jadon Sancho while on loan in the Bundesliga, Hakimi joined Inter Milan this summer and has continued to entertain on the wing. One of the fastest defenders in the game, his sloppy passes have caused headaches for teammates at times, though he is always quick to make up for mistakes with attacking contributions.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Down 2-0 at half-time, Hakimi's brace in the Champions League group-stage match against Inter Milan turned around the tie for Dortmund (they went on to win 3-2).\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe kid from Liverpool is living the dream at Anfield. Liverpool followed up their remarkable Champions League win in 2018-19 with their first league title in 30 years, and Alexander-Arnold once again was vital to the Reds' success. The young defender, who was originally a midfielder in the Liverpool academy, continues to define, and redefine, what full-back play can be in the modern game. His set pieces are a constant threat, and his crosses cause havoc in the penalty area. The England international remains on the way up, but a muscle injury has curtailed his progress this season. That said, the future looks bright for a player who has won 77 of 101 Premier League appearances for his boyhood club.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notching two assists for Virgil van Dijk in the 2-1 win against Brighton in late November, both from set pieces. It was one of the key wins for Liverpool en route to their first-ever Premier League title.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRE-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nBeing a great central defender requires more than size, assertiveness and strength. Some of the modern greats are cultured in possession; others are the epitome of no-nonsense force. The best central defenders combine timing and power with elegance and poise under pressure.\n\nPlayer capsules by Tom Hamilton\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Brazil\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nThe PSG defender was at the forefront of the Ligue 1 champions' journey to the Champions League final in 2019-20. His versatility means PSG boss Thomas Tuchel sometimes uses him in the heart of their midfield, but that has been a bone of contention, with sporting director Leonardo keen to see Marquinhos at centre-back. Wherever he plays, the Brazilian is influential. He's seen as the long-term successor for Thiago Silva, who left for Chelsea in the summer, and is not afraid to speak his mind when asked for his opinion. This made him the perfect candidate to be PSG's new captain, with the club's former defender Jean-Marc Pilorget describing Marquinhos as \"unflappable on the field.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Superb in PSG's Champions League campaign, scoring two key goals against Atalanta and RB Leipzig to help the side into the final.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nRated as one of the world's best young centre-backs, Kounde's brilliant season led to a \"magnificent\" transfer offer from Manchester City, according to Monchi, the club's sporting director. Monchi later praised Kounde's response to the rejected bid, saying he displayed \"professional and respectful behaviour.\" City eventually went for Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias, but Manchester United are also interested in the man who now has his sights on supplanting Raphael Varane and Dayot Upamecano with the France national team. Having moved to Sevilla from Bordeaux for \u00a322.5m ahead of the 2019-20 season, he's since helped them to the Europa League title last season and is an important figure in their Champions League aspirations this term.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Had plenty of eye-catching performances last season, but was singularly magnificent in their quarterfinal win over Wolves in the Europa League.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Netherland\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe Dutch centre-back completed his big-money, \u20ac75 million move to Juventus ahead of the 2019-20 campaign and, in doing so, followed in the footsteps of his idols, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. Initially, then-coach Maurizio Sarri planned to integrate him slowly, but Giorgio Chiellini's long-term injury saw the young defender thrust into the first team. He made a shaky start, but despite battling a shoulder injury in 2020-21, he's become an integral part of the Juventus defence. Juve's 2-0 win at Bologna in June was the match in which De Ligt really announced himself in Serie A. \"He was only born in 1999, and he has been catapulted into a new way of playing. He's smart,\" Chiellini said of De Ligt. The CIES Football Observatory ranks De Ligt as the most valuable central defender in the world, putting his current value at an eye-watering \u20ac105m.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Neatly summed up in his performance against Lyon in the final 16 of the Champions League when he battled on despite having his head cut open early in the match.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/France\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nLaporte's importance at Manchester City is perhaps best illustrated by his absence. There's a popular school of thought that if Laporte hadn't suffered a knee injury that ruled him out for four months, the Premier League title race would have been far closer last season. \"We have missed him a lot; he's the best left central defender in the world,\" City boss Pep Guardiola said of Laporte. \"Imagine the best teams in the world lose their best central defender. He is fast, strong in the air.\" Laporte is one half of a formidable partnership at the back for City alongside new signing Ruben Dias, and they will form the foundations for another push for trophies. Laporte is still waiting to make his debut for the French national team, such are Didier Deschamps' embarrassment of riches for France, but it's a matter of when, not if.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Simply seeing him back in action after a long layoff. Laporte is so important to City that Guardiola had to warn against his return back in January being seen as the single answer to solving all of their defensive worries.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nYet another French international on the list, Varane is one-half of Real Madrid's formidable partnership alongside Sergio Ramos, though the 27-year-old has endured a mixed 2020. He was indispensable in Real's watertight rear guard en route to the league title, with Los Blancos conceding just six in 11 games after the restart, and Varane's friends and teammates, like France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, aren't concerned. \"He is a great champion above all else,\" Lloris said. \"He has great experience. He is a leader in our team.\" And his Real Madrid teammate Eden Hazard has also been impressed: \"I've come across some fantastic defenders during my career, such as John Terry and Vincent Kompany. I think that although [Varane] is still young, he's already one of the best centre-backs of all time.\" Despite questions over his form -- he still ranks fourth in Europe's big five leagues for aerial defensive duels won this season -- he always fronts up, takes responsibility and seeks improvement.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 32 league games as Real clinched their first La Liga crown since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: RB Leipzig/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe young Frenchman has been linked with just about every European giant after another strong season, with Manchester United and Bayern Munich reportedly at the front of the queue. \"As for the future, I'm not sure [if Upamecano will stay] as he is very talented,\" Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann told ESPN. \"Lots of clubs will want to buy him -- perhaps next season, it could be real that he leaves the club.\" Even though he's just 22, Upamecano plays with authority at the back, unafraid to carry the ball out of defence but also positionally aware to know when to take a safer option. Alongside Kounde, Kurt Zouma and Aymeric Laporte, he's one of a number of brilliant defenders at France boss Didier Deschamps' disposal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In a season when RB Leipzig got to the semifinals of the Champions League, he was at his commanding best in their quarterfinal win against Atletico Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Napoli/Senegal\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThere's not a transfer window that goes by without a handful of the European giants being linked with the Napoli defender. The latest team to chase the 6-foot-5 Senegal international was PSG in the summer, but Napoli were resolute in rejecting any offers that fell short of their \u20ac75m asking price. \"I had no doubts, he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role,\" Napoli boss Gennaro Gattuso said in September of Koulibaly. He's now his national team's captain and was rated by ex-Spain goalkeeper Pepe Reina as the best centre-back he's played behind. The future remains uncertain for Koulibaly with a number of teams forever linked with him -- Liverpool could go back in for him amid their defensive injury crisis -- but for now, he is indispensable to Napoli.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Though Napoli finished second to Juventus again in the league, Koulibaly was superb in the Coppa Italia final as his side bested the league champions on penalties.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Austria\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 2 (left-back)\n\nWhat can you say about one of the most versatile defenders in the modern game? Alaba started last season at left-back under previous coach Niko Kovac, only to finish it as a triple-winning centre-back. The Austrian player's contract is up at the end of the season, and Bayern Munich are bracing for his exit -- expect the likes of Liverpool to be interested. Bayern manager Hansi Flick says Alaba \"holds the defence together,\" while Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in August likened Alaba's impact at centre back to the transformational qualities of Franz Beckenbauer. \"We haven't had a 'chief' in defence for some time now, one who really takes the reins in hand and sets the tone there and simply acts as the head of the defensive unit -- he did that,\" Rummenigge said.\n\nHigh point of 2020: There were numerous standout moments for Alaba, but the past 12 months will be remembered as the time Bayern Munich swept all before them, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nThe Real Madrid talisman continues to be a polarising figure, but love him or hate him, he is a truly remarkable player. His Real teammate Toni Kroos calls him the \"absolute captain\" and the \"best you can have.\" Despite his age, Ramos would still walk into most sides and will be a top free agent if he opts against extending his stay at Real Madrid after this season. In the meantime, he continues to set records, having passed the 100-goal mark for Los Blancos and also set a record with his 45th El Clasico appearance when Real Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in late October. Ramos is still indispensable for Spain at the international level, too, with Luis Enrique calling him a \"unique, different level\" defender, and he recently set a record there as well, with his 177th Spain cap against Germany, the most appearances at international level for anyone in the men's game in Europe.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Los Blancos supporters will remember his key penalties in Real's back-to-back 1-0 wins over Getafe and Athletic Bilbao in July, as they continued their charge to the 2019-20 La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Netherlands\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nIt's testament to Van Dijk that when he suffered his season-ending injury against Everton in October, the mood around Liverpool changed. Gigi Wijnaldum said that the squad had suffered \"sleepless nights,\" while Jurgen Klopp admits Van Dijk is irreplaceable. \"Every team in the world would miss Virgil van Dijk,\" Klopp said soon after his injury. \"He is the best in the world.\" Up to that injury, the Dutch international had missed just one Premier League game for Liverpool after signing from Southampton for \u00a375m in January 2018.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing every single minute (and scoring five goals) in Liverpool's 2019-20 Premier League-winning season, the club's first league title in 30 years. Need we say more?\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nLEFT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nTop left-backs are as comfortable locking down an opposing winger as they are turning into one when their teams are in possession. Some aren't even left-footed, using their positional awareness to drift infield and be another central defender or midfielder if needed.\n\nIn the modern era, no positions touch the ball more than full-back, making the best of them simply indispensable.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 7\n\nMendy established himself as Real Madrid's undisputed first-choice left-back this year after coach Zinedine Zidane requested his signing in the summer of 2019. In the biggest games, against Barcelona in La Liga or Manchester City in the Champions League, Mendy -- not Marcelo -- gets the nod. Mendy might lack his teammate's eye-catching skills, but he offers a defensive solidity that helped the team keep clean sheet after clean sheet post-lockdown. He's no slouch going forward, either.\n\nHigh point of 2020: His only goal for the club so far, a thunderous near-post finish against Granada as Real Madrid closed in on the La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nMarcelo's reputation and history -- and Real Madrid's title win -- see him make this list even though, by his own standards, he had a disappointing year. The 32-year-old started fewer than half of Real Madrid's games in 2019-20, and the defensive lapses that have made him an occasional liability during a hugely successful club career became increasingly common. Since Zinedine Zidane returned for his second spell in charge, in 2019, Madrid have lost nine league games, and Marcelo started all of them. No one doubts his talent and personality, though, and on his day, there are few footballers who are more fun to watch.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his fifth league title in 14 years as a Real Madrid player.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/England\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nChilwell was an important part of Leicester City's impressive 2019-20 campaign, and his August move to Chelsea -- after a drawn-out transfer saga that saw Leicester demand a world-record fee for a defender before accepting \"only\" \u00a350m -- cemented his status as one of English football's best young players. Wasting no time at Stamford Bridge, Chilwell provided a goal and assist on his Premier League debut. Coach Frank Lampard says he's \"fantastic,\" praising Chilwell's \"ability to be so high up the pitch when you want him.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: A glorious 90th-minute goal vs. Watford in Leicester's first game back in June, which was somewhat spoiled by Watford equalising three minutes later.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/France\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThis has been a year of rediscovery for the young Frenchman as he finally started to resemble the powerful, expansive full-back it was hoped he'd become when he graduated from the Atletico Madrid academy alongside his older brother, Lucas. Hernandez excelled on loan at Alaves in 2016-17, looked out of his depth at Real Madrid in 2017-18 and was decidedly average at Real Sociedad in 2018-19. At Milan, though, he's been a revelation. Hernandez scored six goals in Serie A last season, with Opta rating him as the best left-back in Italy.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A crisp, volleyed finish in a 3-2 win over Udinese in January.\n\nClub/country: Tottenham/Spain\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nArguably the best full-back in La Liga last season, Reguilon was a blur of constant movement on the left flank of Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla team as they cruised to a top-four league finish and won the Europa League. But, remarkably, Real Madrid chose to cash in, selling him to Tottenham off the back of that impressive loan. It's true that Real have a buyback clause, but why wait for a season or two? Reguilon is good enough to be starting for Real Madrid right now. In the meantime, he's become an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Spurs side, one that has a very real shot at winning the Premier League.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning the Europa League in his last game for Sevilla.\n\nClub/country: Borussia Dortmund/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGuerreiro doesn't attract the headlines of others on this list -- or of some high-profile teammates at Dortmund -- but he quietly had the best season of his career in 2019-20. Coach Lucien Favre's tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation helped enormously, enabling Guerreiro to operate in the wing-back role to which he is best suited while minimising the defects that hold him back as a pure full-back or winger. A well-rounded player, he contributed an impressive eight goals to Dortmund's second-placed Bundesliga finish. At 26, he's approaching his peak, and chose to sign a new deal in October 2019 despite reported interest from Barcelona and PSG.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring twice in Dortmund's 4-0 derby win over Schalke in May.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Brazil\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nTaking fourth place in our list for the fourth year in a row suggests Sandro is consistency personified. Into his sixth season at Juventus and soon to turn 30, he remains one of the most reliable performers in world football in his position. (Juventus were so excited about signing him in 2015 that they published a glowing story on the team website about his myriad qualities.) Sandro isn't quite as dangerous going forward as you might expect, though there aren't any real weaknesses to his game. Brazilian great Roberto Carlos said in 2015 that Sandro was his true \"successor,\" and few can argue with his assessment.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored Juventus' third goal in a 3-3 roller-coaster draw with Sassuolo, then cleared a potential winner off the line.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Spain\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nAlba is past his peak and looks to have been left behind by Spain at the international level, but he's still Barcelona's undisputed first-choice left-back. His link-ups with Lionel Messi -- once one of the most fruitful attacking partnerships in football -- remain dangerous, albeit less frequent. Alba has set up three goals this season under new coach Ronald Koeman. His defensive failings are well known, and unlikely to change at this stage. Barcelona have tried to prepare for life after Alba -- the Spain international will be 32 in March -- but Lucas Digne and Junior Firpo have already failed to supplant him at the Camp Nou.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Whatever it was, it wasn't Barca's 8-2 defeat to Bayern.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Canada\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nDavies' emergence as a world-class player has been thrilling to watch. Take his assist in Bayern's 8-2 Champions League demolition of Barcelona, when he evaded Lionel Messi, left Arturo Vidal on the floor and flummoxed Nelson Semedo before cutting the ball back for Joshua Kimmich to tap in. Was there a more memorable setup in 2020? \"I was almost ashamed of how happy I was after scoring, because it was 99% his goal,\" Kimmich said afterward, and it was hard to disagree.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That assist, obviously, though winning a domestic/European Treble with Bayern was also extremely special.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Scotland\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThis year's title win, ending Liverpool's 30-year wait, was the culmination of a remarkable journey for Robertson. In three years at Anfield, he's gone from Premier League prospect to, quite simply, the best left-back in the world. It almost seems wrong to call him \"left-back\" given how prolific he is in attack, racking up 23 assists in the past two Premier League seasons from a defensive position. In terms of creating chances, taking set pieces and working tirelessly off the ball, he is a cut above. He racked up his 100th Premier League appearance for the club, and the \u00a310m that Liverpool spent on Robertson in 2017 from Hull City increasingly looks like one of the best bits of transfer business ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool won the league. You might have heard about it.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRAL MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe key to playing central midfield is a good sense of rhythm: knowing when to speed up in transition and when to slow the pace. There are many forms, too: the tough tackler, box-to-box machine and the nimble playmaker. It's about seeing the whole field -- and exploiting it.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Italy\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nIt has been a stop-start year for most players amid the coronavirus pandemic, but especially for Verratti. The French league decided to curtail the 2019-20 season in March, and when PSG eventually returned to competitive action in the French Cup final and Champions League in the summer, Verratti was injured. He reappeared as a substitute in the CL semifinal win over RB Leipzig before featuring for 25 minutes in the final against Bayern. However, while staying fit remains a problem, his absences from Thomas Tuchel's side serve only to highlight his importance. PSG are a different side with pass-master Verratti in their midfield, and he's also playing a big role in the rejuvenation of the Italian national team under Roberto Mancini.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Completing a domestic Treble with PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Croatia\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nModric might be in the twilight of his playing career, but he's still getting it done in one of the most demanding midfields and for one of the most demanding fan bases. The Croatian midfielder's ability on the ball and his vision of the game have always been his strong suit. It's how he casually guided Croatia to the World Cup final in 2018 and picked up the Ballon d'Or -- the first player not named Messi or Ronaldo to win it since 2007 -- in the same year. That's why Zinedine Zidane still trusts him to deliver at the highest level.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored his first-ever El Clasico goal last season as Real surged to the title at their rivals' expense.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Netherlands\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThe Dutch midfielder was the poster boy of European football when he joined Barca from Ajax for \u20ac70 million in 2019, but his first season in Spain showed him that not everything is always rosy in football. After excelling as the deepest midfielder at Ajax, he is playing a more attacking role under first Ernesto Valverde and later Quique Setien in Spain. Despite being moved around and having to adapt to a new country and a new language, De Jong showed glimpses of his talent, and there are signs of improvement in his second season at the club. Under his third coach at Camp Nou -- his compatriot Ronald Koeman -- he looks more comfortable in a \"double pivot\" (a pair of deep-lying midfielders who shield the defense and share creative responsibilities), and Barca hope he can rule their midfield for the next decade.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Has played every minute for Barcelona in La Liga this season.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nThe Brazilian won the Champions League in his first season with Liverpool and the Premier League title in his second. Not bad, right? He has excelled for Jurgen Klopp's side at the base of the midfield as an imposing figure who also offers a touch of class on the ball. He was incredible in the 3-1 win over Manchester City in November 2019, opening the scoring. His versatility is increasingly important, too. He played as a full-back earlier in his career at Real Madrid and AS Monaco, but is just as comfortable slotting into central defense for the Reds after a serious injury to Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played 28 games in Liverpool's first-ever Premier League title win.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere are more glamorous players at Liverpool, but England international Henderson took the plaudits for his side's Premier League triumph last season. For his performances on the pitch, his influence as the club's captain and his work with the #playerstogether initiative during the coronavirus lockdown, he's finally getting the respect his career has demanded. Henderson is not a highlight-reel player at the base of the Reds' midfield, but his hard work, unfussy style of play and passionate captaincy remain essential to the Reds' success. He's never been a player who captures the imagination at Liverpool -- or anywhere, for that matter -- but there's a reason his is the first name Jurgen Klopp puts on the team sheet.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A Premier League title, anyone?\n\nplay 1:00 Laurens: Mbappe will dominate for the next 10 years Julien Laurens believes Kylian Mbappe will be the next generational player once Messi and Ronaldo retire.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/France\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nEden Hazard once said that Kante is so good that he plays like two men in midfield, and who can argue? Understated and always willing to let more talented teammates get the glory, Kante is the perfect pivot for club and country. Though injuries and a positional change under then-Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri reduced his effectiveness, there are signs under Frank Lampard that he is refinding his best form. Back at the base of the midfield and with a stellar attack ahead of him, his relentless work in winning the ball back and distributing it could prove just as important as the goals and assists Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner contribute.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helped Chelsea to finish runner-up in the FA Cup despite missing much of the season through injury and concerns around COVID-19. Also passed 150 appearances for the club despite transfer interest from PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nTo classify Casemiro as a \"destroyer\" in midfield is to do the Brazil international a disservice. He offers much more to Madrid than just protection to the back four, and you could even argue he's become their most important player. When he doesn't play, Madrid struggle. He missed three league games last season, and Madrid won only one of them. Madrid conceded four at Valencia in November when he was absent with the coronavirus. He also has developed a knack for scoring important goals: twice in the 2-1 win against Sevilla last season, and the winner in the 1-0 victory at Espanyol as Madrid closed in on the league title. He was also on target against Borussia Monchengladbach in October as Zinedine Zidane's side came from behind to draw 2-2 in the Champions League. The other goal was scored by Karim Benzema, but guess who set it up? Casemiro.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games in the coronavirus-impacted La Liga season en route to the league title, his second since joining the club in 2013.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Germany\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nKroos is into his seventh season with Madrid and remains as important to Zinedine Zidane's side as ever. Take it from ZZ himself, who enjoys simply watching the German midfielder at practice. \"I love to watch Toni train,\" Zidane said. \"I love to be there for his training sessions. They're exceptional sessions. I'm not saying it for the sake of it. It's true. I've never seen him lose the ball. Well, maybe once. His game is always elegant and efficient. He never has a bad day.\" Even Pep Guardiola, who managed Kroos at Bayern Munich, raved about his former charge in a 2020 documentary: \"The players that shout the most are those that hide when things go badly. Toni is the opposite, he's the bravest of them all in the most difficult moments.\" Before last season, Kroos had won La Liga once, but his consistency in Madrid's 10-game winning run -- Casemiro said earlier this year that \"Real Madrid matches always go in Kroos' rhythm\" -- when football resumed in June helped Los Blancos end a three-year wait for the Spanish title.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games and adding several key assists on the way to Real's La Liga title, their first since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Spain\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThiago turned heads this summer when he signed for Liverpool, but it wasn't the transfer that shocked people; rather, it was the fact that other elite teams across Europe didn't put up a fight to sign him instead. Despite a string of challenging injuries throughout his career, Thiago has ability and creative skills that have never diminished. Even last season he missed the run-in in the Bundesliga, although before that he had been influential in Bayern's turnaround under Hansi Flick, and he returned in time for the Champions League knockout phase to exert his authority on the competition. At his best, he's a peerless deep-lying playmaker, perfect for unlocking packed defenses -- something Liverpool face often -- with a clever pass or swivel of the hips. He makes everything look so simple and was the best player on the pitch in the final in Lisbon -- completing 85 passes, more than any other player (Kimmich managed 78) -- as Bayern beat PSG to clinch the Treble.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Finishing his final season at Bayern in style, with a domestic/European Treble and, most notably, his first Champions League winners' medal since he got one with Barcelona in 2010-11.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 2 (right-back)\n\nKimmich is a coach's dream. Last season, he alternated effortlessly between the right-back and defensive midfield positions. He even filled in at centre-back occasionally, though coach Hansi Flick prefers him in midfield, especially since the sale of Thiago to Liverpool. For old time's sake, it was at right-back, with Benjamin Pavard returning from injury, where he took on the role of chief creator in Bayern's run to Champions League glory in the summer. He scored one and created four of his side's goals in the quarterfinal stage, including assisting the winner in the final for Kingsley Coman. Still just 25, he is Bayern's present and future.\n\nHigh point of 2020: He was instrumental in Bayern's first Champions League win since 2012-13, Jupp Heynckes' final season with the club.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nATTACKING MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe best attacking midfielders have a sense of mischief, capable of cracking a robust defensive set with improvisation or magic. Greats make the most of their free roles to entertain, create and convert.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Aston Villa/England\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nBig things have been expected from Grealish since he made his Premier League debut at 18 for Aston Villa in 2014. However, it's over only the past 12 months that he has really kicked on. He's a more mature, productive player on the pitch and, after helping Villa stay up on the final day of last season, he's started the new season in red-hot form for club and country. A midfielder who excels with the ball at his feet and who knows how to create space, it's not hard to understand why he's been linked to both Manchester United and Manchester City in 2020.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Grealish scored twice and set up three goals in Villa's extraordinary 7-2 win against Liverpool in October.\n\nClub/country: Lyon/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe Lyon side that reached the Champions League semifinal last season was brimming with talent, but the jewel in the Ligue 1 side's crown was undoubtedly Aouar. He tore apart Juventus and Manchester City in an advanced midfield role, setting up four of Lyon's five goals against the two European giants as they set up a final four meeting with eventual winners Bayern. A quick-footed creator with trickery in abundance, Aouar resisted a summer move to the Premier League, though it's just a matter of time until his skills enhance a bigger club and on a bigger stage.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Lyon to within 90 minutes of the Champions League final with a string of match-winning performances.\n\nClub/country: Man United/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nFew players divide opinion quite like Pogba. France teammate Antoine Griezmann told ESPN that Pogba is the \"most underrated player in the world,\" but not everyone would agree. He has arguably flattered to deceive since returning to Manchester United from Juventus for \u20ac100m in 2016 -- together, they've won just one League Cup and a Europa League in four seasons -- but the underlying feeling is that he is still one of the best box-to-box midfielders on his day. He is capable of the sublime, if he can stay fit. Last season was tainted by injuries -- he was restricted to 21 appearances, scoring just one goal -- but with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford and a settled XI under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the conditions are ripe for Pogba to show his best.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Setting up the crucial second goal after coming off the bench in a Champions League group stage win at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nSilva was not able to live up to his excellent 2018-19 campaign last season, but when on form, he remains one of Europe's most creative midfielders. Even so, he still managed to score six goals and record seven assists as Man City finished second in the Premier League in 2019-20. However, he didn't even make it off the bench as City were stunned by Lyon in the Champions League quarterfinal when the tournament resumed in August. His aim this season is to win his place back in the City XI by rediscovering the form that led coach Pep Guardiola to say: \"Right now, it's Bernardo and 10 more players.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notched a goal and an assist against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semifinals, putting City on course to win their only trophy of the 2019-20 season.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/Germany\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nChelsea have lacked a dominant playmaker from midfielder for years, but in signing Havertz, the No. 10 spot is secured for years to come. Havertz is mature beyond his years: as a 20-year-old last season, he steered Bayer Leverkusen to a fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga with 12 goals. He also scored in four out of five Europa League games as Leverkusen reached the final eight, where they lost to eventual runners-up Inter Milan. Many expect him to become one of the best players in the world, and he's already a regular under Frank Lampard at Chelsea, who was \"overwhelmed\" with his new signing's humility and quiet confidence upon arrival in England.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Leverkusen to the final eight of the Europa League was good, but a hat trick in a League Cup win over Barnsley was a nice moment early in his Chelsea career.\n\nplay 1:40 Klopp the FC 100's best boss after 'historic' season Gab Marcotti explains how Jurgen Klopp beat Hansi Flick to the FC 100 best manager award.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGoretzka's physical transformation since signing for Bayern from Schalke has mirrored the German club's rise back to the top of European football. The once-slender midfielder looks more like a bodybuilder than a soccer star these days, having put on a tremendous amount of muscle. The extra bulk has helped keep him healthy, and Bayern benefit from his resilience: He was integral in Bayern's dominant Treble-winning season, weighing in with eight goals and 11 assists. \"The day I was unveiled at Bayern, I said I'd like to assume a role of responsibility within the team,\" Goretzka said this summer, \"and I'm moving more in that direction now. Maybe also imposing myself a bit more as I've got physically stronger. And that's a development I'm pleased with.\" Aggressive without being reckless and assertive without racking up yellow and red cards, Goretzka is, as former RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick puts it, \"the best box-to-box player in the world.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played a big role in Bayern's Treble-winning season.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Argentina\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGomez is one of the great Atalanta success stories. Plucked from Metalist Kharkiv for just \u00a34m in 2014, he's now regarded as one of the world's best midfielders. He even got a recall to the Argentina national team at the age of 32, three years after he won his fourth cap. He is arguably the frontman for this band of unfashionable players who have turned into European powerhouses under Gian Piero Gasperini. His record of seven goals and 16 assists in the Italian top flight belies his true influence: He is the conduit for his team's attack (a team that scored the most goals in the Italian top flight last season) and his form saw him named Serie A midfielder of the year.\n\nAs Atalanta captain, Gomez also played an important role in helping heal Bergamo. Atalanta's Lombardy region was hit hard by COVID-19 back in March, recording over 16,000 deaths because of the pandemic. Atalanta became a symbol of hope for that part of Italy, and their charge to the Champions League quarterfinals was as much for the region as it was for the players. During lockdown, Gomez used his social media platform to share \"life hacks\" such as how to repurpose plastic bottles, or offering indoor workout plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Returning to the Argentina national team after years without a call-up.\n\nClub/country: Manchester United/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nFernandes has been so good since signing for Manchester United for an initial fee of \u20ac55 million that it seems as though he's been there for years. In 14 Premier League appearances last season, he scored eight goals and created seven more, confirming that he could do in England what he'd done in Portugal, where he hit 20 goals in the Primeira Liga in 2018-19. Fernandes has done more of the same at the start of this season, with goals and match-winning performances against Brighton and Everton. He's not even been at Old Trafford for a year, but he's already United's talisman.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was instrumental in Man United's return to the Champions League and third-place finish in 2019-20.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNot only has Muller been one of the best players in the world over the past year, with his own unique sense of humour, but he's also one of the most entertaining. Muller was so good in the early 2010s they named a position after him -- the \"Raumdeuter\" (\"interpreter of space\") -- but the past season has been a seesaw of emotions. He started the 2019-20 season exiled under previous Bayern boss Niko Kovac and was contemplating leaving, but when Hansi Flick took charge, he put Muller slap-bang in the middle of his attacking lineup and Muller delivered. He finished the most recent campaign with a record-breaking 21 assists in the Bundesliga and helped Bayern deliver a remarkable Treble -- aided by his two goals in their 8-2 dismantling of Barcelona. His form has led to widespread calls for Joachim Low to bring him back in from the cold for Germany, but Low is still trying his best to ignore them.\n\nMuller has also provided us with a huge amount of enjoyment off the pitch. His social media account is wonderfully personable, and his impression of the Road Runner in describing Alphonso Davies' pace was brilliant. And he has now offered a second word into the football lexicon, with \"Lewan-goal-ski\" now alongside his very own position, even though he's not sure whether the definition fits his style. \"I'm always on the prowl. But I'm also more than just a 'Raumdeuter.' My skills on the ball are also very good. But of course, my great strength is making runs with the right timing.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing an instrumental role in Bayern's three-trophy season.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nManchester City missed out on the title to Liverpool last season by an 18-point margin, but De Bruyne's work did not go unnoticed. In 35 Premier League appearances, he set up 20 goals for his teammates, matching the record for assists in a single season held by Arsenal great Thierry Henry. He also scored 13 goals for Pep Guardiola's side as they ended the season in second place. De Bruyne won't want to come second again, meaning his motor and creativity will be pivotal to City wrestling the title back from Merseyside.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Matching the Premier League's single-season assist record.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nWING\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nWingers still have a role to play in the modern era. Their pace and persistence on the flanks give their teams another angle of attack; their ability to cut infield and shoot adds a dimension too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nVinicius still feels more like a bundle of raw attributes -- pace, trickery -- than a fully formed player. He frustrates as often as he thrills, a view shared by his own Real Madrid teammates at times, as evidenced by Karim Benzema blasting Vinicius to another player while the Brazilian watched back in October. But when Real Madrid need a goal or a different dimension in attack, they turn to Vinicius. Half the time, even he doesn't look as if he knows what's going to happen next, but maybe that's the point. In a modern game that is so often defined by rigid tactical discipline, his unpredictability can be priceless.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the opening goal against Barcelona in El Clasico in March, a match that saw the title race start to tip in Real Madrid's favour.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nHazard called 2019-20 \"the worst season of my career\" and it's hard to argue. He was out of shape on his arrival at Real Madrid, and an ankle fracture in November followed by another in February meant Hazard was essentially an irrelevance in their title win. At least the campaign's delayed conclusion allowed him to recover in time to make some unremarkable late appearances. Serious questions have been asked about the wisdom of Madrid investing so much -- reportedly up to \u20ac160m -- in Hazard in 2019, especially when he would have been available for free a year later. No one doubts his world-class talent, though, and we might still see a player who was once the Premier League's best repeat that form in a Real Madrid shirt.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A stunning long-range goal against Huesca in October 2020 suggested that better things could be just around the corner.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Argentina\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nSevilla transfer guru Monchi rarely gets a deal wrong, but the bargain \u20ac15m signing of Ocampos from Marseille must rank among his best acquisitions ever. At that point, the Argentinian looked like a solid professional, albeit performing below the potential he'd shown as a youngster at River Plate, with underwhelming spells in Ligue 1 and Serie A. At Sevilla, he has developed into the best winger, and one of the most effective players in any position, in La Liga. His boundless reserves of energy are a perfect fit for Julen Lopetegui's exhausting, all-action brand of football. One game summed up his season: Not only did Ocampos score in Sevilla's 1-0 win over Eibar in July but he also went in goal when keeper Tomas Vaclik got injured, even making a crucial save in the ninth minute of added time.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's tempting to say the Europa League win, but let's face it: the brilliant madness of stand-in keeper Ocampos saving from actual Eibar keeper Dmitrovic (yes, really) in the 99th minute is hard to beat.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere was a cruel poetry to the manner of Paris Saint-Germain's 2020 Champions League final defeat. Having spent over a billion euros to get within touching distance of the trophy they crave above all others, they were denied by a headed goal from Coman -- one of their own, discarded youth products. Coman joined PSG at the age of 10 and became their youngest-ever debutant at 16 before deciding to continue his career elsewhere. Still improving and into his sixth season at Bayern, he has an experience beyond his years and a trophy cabinet to match.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner in a Champions League final against his former club.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/United States\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPulisic's first season in England might have ended on a sour note, with him looking distraught as he limped off with a hamstring injury in Chelsea's FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal, but that shouldn't obscure what had come before it. Pulisic did enough that day at Wembley -- and in the 2019-20 season as a whole -- to suggest that all the hype around the U.S. star is absolutely justified. Nine Premier League goals from 25 appearances was an impressive return for a wide player, and more than twice as many as he ever scored in a season at Borussia Dortmund, which suggests he's progressing nicely under coach Frank Lampard despite those injury problems.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That fifth-minute FA Cup final goal.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe most important sports story of 2023 was the wrestlers' protest. It was unique in profile and scale, and ultimately duration: three of the country's greatest ever wrestlers took on the system - the wrestling federation, the sports ministry, the wider sporting ecosystem - for two protests in the heart of the national capital. Sakshi Malik, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, and several of their peers and contemporaries, were protesting against the running of the Wrestling Federation of India, specifically against the alleged serial sexual harassment of women wrestlers by its president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\nThe story was reported in the media, but the narrative was always hostage to various competing perspectives, especially those of the people in positions of power. In her *memoir Witness Sakshi gives the wrestlers' side of the story. We already know the timeline from when the wrestlers first sat down at Jantar Mantar to the emotional scenes at Haridwar but Witness adds detail, especially the \"why\" and the \"how\" to the \"what\". And what emerges, in Sakshi's words, is a tale of broken promises, of how each stage of the protest was undone by naivete and misplaced trust, of how the protesters \"had been gamed\" by everyone else.\n\nThere's a caveat, of course, when reading this: It's Sakshi's version (and presumably that of Vinesh and Bajrang too). But when you consider who was on the other side, putting out one's own story becomes risky business, which adds credence to this.\n\nIt all started with someone very close to the wrestlers -- Babita Phogat, cousin to Vinesh and sister-in-law to Bajrang. Sakshi writes about how Babita -- whose connections with the BJP were public - convinced them all that she had a line to the topmost levels of the Indian government, and people in power would ensure the wrestlers would get justice. Babita convinced them to start the protest and then distanced herself from it; as the book notes, she was never at the protest site. For her it had been a big political game; for Sakshi and the wrestlers, they'd laid everything on the line. The brutality of this betrayal hit all three of them deep, but it was to be only the beginning.\n\nOver the course of the next few months, the wrestlers would feel the full force of the indifference (and opposition) of the Indian political machinery. They got a sample of it early on when, three days into the protest, they met the then Union sports minister, Anurag Thakur. In an emotionally charged environment, as Sakshi and her fellow women wrestlers detailed their harrowing encounters with Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, Thakur sat emotionless, with an expression that indicated he just wanted it all to be over with.\n\n\"I had done everything with absolute sincerity, and despite that, I'd been tricked.\" Photo by Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\n\n\"Anurag Thakur sat there, listening quietly,\" Sakshi writes. \"There was no emotion on his face. If he was shocked by anything he heard, he didn't show it. His reaction was in complete contrast to everyone else's. As each of us told our stories, the atmosphere in the room became steadily more emotional. Some of the younger girls were already breaking down in tears. But Thakur could have been listening to someone talking about the weather. It was as if he was bored and just wanted our meeting to be over. \"\n\nWhile still at Thakur's house, Bajrang received a call from Union home minister Amit Shah, who assured them of action being taken against Singh. On that assurance, and despite their reservations, they called off their initial protest. The moment they did that, though, Sakshi knew something was off. \"I broke down,\" she writes. \"I had done everything with absolute sincerity, and despite that, I'd been tricked. It felt as if the wind had been kicked out of my stomach\"\n\nThakur then said Singh would be withdrawn from the daily functioning of the federation, which would now be run by an oversight committee. It would include, on Sakshi's suggestion, Mary Kom, whom Sakshi held up as a role model for her fearlessness and champion attitude.\n\nThis initially gave the wrestlers hope. On hearing Sakshi's account of her harassment by Singh, Mary even told her that it was similar to what she had experienced too, that she would ensure Sakshi and the wrestlers got justice.\n\nOne of the more harrowing passages in the book is Sakshi's description of the wrestlers who'd made allegations against Singh testifying before the IOA committee investigating the charges:\n\n\"All of us thirteen female wrestlers sat in the same room and told our stories, one after the other. It was difficult for the younger ones, but they knew that their seniors were standing right alongside them. One of the girls telling her story was very young... She started to cry as she recalled this, and the other young girls started to cry too. Once they began to weep, I couldn't control myself. I started tearing up, and then Vinesh did too. The women members of the committee who were listening to us, and finally the woman lawyer, who were in the same room, started to cry too. They started to hug the girls who were testifying. They said 'Please don't cry, we will get you justice. Don't worry.'\n\nMary Kom too said she would get us justice. It was a very emotional moment for all of us, but it was cathartic too. Finally, everyone had to started to understand what we were dealing with. Their tears told us they believed us. Now they would go to the IOA and the government and tell them just how rotten the state of Indian wrestling was.\"\n\n\"What was supposed to be a great act of defiance had turned into a complete farce.\" Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images\n\nNothing happened, however. The final report that the committee submitted had nothing of substance in it. \"Were the committee members' jobs and positions so important to them that they couldn't even stand up for what was right? That they couldn't admit that women wrestlers in the country were facing sexual harassment,\" writes Sakshi.\n\nFriends, politicians, and now fellow sportspersons had all thrown them under the bus. They learned from this (or thought they had), and for the second protest, there was no easy appeasement, no falling for false promises. The book details the hardships they faced while spending days and nights in the open in the Delhi summer, but also the kindness of strangers, of ordinary Indians -- mostly farmers from Haryana -- who would come to the protest, show their solidarity and give them money for the cause.\n\nEventually, the wrestlers took their protest to Hardwar, where they planned to immerse their medals into the Ganga. In the drama that unfolded, with calls from various political and social leaders, only person emerged a winner -- the farmer leader Naresh Tikait, who snatched away the medals from the bewildered, emotionally charged wrestlers' hands, and nullified the whole protest. \"Within a couple of minutes,\" she writes, \"we realised what a tremendous mistake we had made. What was supposed to be a great act of defiance had turned into a complete farce. Not only had we not been able to get Brij Bhushan Singh out of the federation or give up our medals, but we had also broken our word to the people who had supported us.\"\n\nThat broke the back of the protest but the final nail, she writes, came from Shah and Thakur again, when they promised to listen to the wrestlers' requests and ensure a woman candidate would become president of the federation. This is when they finally decided to get off the streets completely -- only to see Singh's cronies hoisted into power in the elections a few months later, with not a woman administrator in sight.\n\nThe defeat had been total. Having started the protest with the intention of forcing Singh out of power, of trying to ensure his crimes were paid for, it had all ended with the sight of Singh celebrating loudly, garlands around his neck, all the power still ensconced in his clenched fists.\n\n*Witness, by Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, is published by Juggernaut Books",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSakshi Malik has made history on the wrestling mat - the first Indian woman athlete to win an Olympic medal, till today the only Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal. She has made headlines off the mat too, taking on the very powerful system and, if not winning completely, at least forcing a change of guard. Yet her most impactful achievement, in a broader sense, might be through a most unexpected route: her memoirs.\n\nThe underlying theme through most of *Witness - a refreshingly, at times brutally honest read, rare for an Indian public figure - is her advocacy for everyday women's issues, that are rarely spoken about. From something as seemingly trivial as negative body image amid societal beauty standards, to the need for women (athletes and others) to be financially independent, Sakshi has written one of the boldest books - even the most \"feminist\" - by an Indian sportswoman.\n\nIt would have been easy for her to focus on the historic medal, her unique career, and her continued spearheading of the wrestling protests now. But for her to repeatedly highlight women's issues - especially in an astonishing chapter titled 'Body Talk (A Small Digression) - makes this book one of the most important in Indian sport. This is everyday feminism at its essence, not a technical definition but the basic truth that genders don't get equal treatment, so women have to first know and then fight for their daily rights.\n\nNothing is off limits when talking about these issues, not even the most intimate details of her family life. For a self-professed avoider of confrontations, she says this book was a great medium to share her thoughts with the world. One of her most important life lessons came after the Olympic medal win. Her family was refusing to let her marry her longtime partner, fellow wrestler Satyawart Kadian, and had gone through elaborate attempts to try and block it. She soon realised, though, that their objection was partly financially motivated; an assumption that all her post-Olympic windfall would go to her marital home. Sakshi, whose banking was handled by her family, later discovered that her accounts were cleared out of the post-Olympics rewards she'd received.\n\nIn a lengthy chat with ESPN, Sakshi reaffirmed her thinking. \"They tell girls that they are anyway supposed to go to some other's [husband] house. And when they get to that some other's house, they are told that their house is the other one [parents']. So our financial security, our understanding... we need to have full knowledge of all it, we need to be independent.\"\n\nTo push to marry her partner was itself -- in the context of the extremely patriarchal society she lived in -- an act of bravery. No one in her circles had married for love and she did not want to malign her family reputation by going against their will. Eventually, she had to leak the news of her engagement to get her family's approval, because appearances matter.\n\n(L-R) Satyawart Kadian and Sakshi Malik attend the 2024 TIME100 Gala. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for TIME\n\nIt's a touching love story, almost Bollywood cinematic in its obstacles. But it's telling of the prevalent mindset in the majority of the country, where a woman's wealth and agency is not her own, even when she has won an Olympic medal.\n\nShe reveals the struggles and describes with honesty what it means to be a woman from Haryana, who has to consider the societal implications of simple actions like growing her hair out, talking to boys or wearing sleeveless clothing. Sakshi addresses her own naivete in these incidents candidly, intending it as both an indictment of the patriarchal society and a learning for young Indian women from her background. She has spoken about the imperceptible challenges of being a career sportswoman in a way no Indian athlete of her stature has before.\n\n\"I went all in on the wrestling during my career and never really paid attention to things like where's the money is going,\" she told ESPN. \"I had a straight focus: I want to wrestle. You must have read in the book also that I had no interest in other things like roaming around, partying, functions... My focus was always wrestling, getting into the Olympics and winning a medal. I just want to say that while this is a good thing - focusing on achieving your goal - you also need to be aware side-by-side of all the other things.\"\n\nShe even revealed that most of her felicitation appearances were a mask with this familial turmoil in the background. All while adjusting to dresses, make-up and high heels she was made to wear to look well-groomed in front of the camera. Any woman can attest to this being daunting in itself for the first time, to do it as a woman raised in a wrestling academy of Haryana, there's an added layer of insecurity.\n\nIncidentally, the one person who has pushed her to take charge of her finances early on was none other than Vinesh Phogat, who has been a compelling character in Sakshi's recollections.\n\n\"I wanted to talk about all this. I don't want other girls to go through what happened to me, what I faced after the Olympics because first a girl, secondly a sport like this... a girl's sporting career is very short, so we need to manage everything in it.\"\n\nLately, Sakshi has been in the news as one of the leaders of the wrestlers' protests against former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, a former MP from the BJP. He's been accused of sexual harassment of women wrestlers, and other administrational malpractice, and Sakshi has detailed the background and her role in the protests.\n\nESPN\n\nThe most striking revelation is, without doubt, her unwavering detailing of the harassment she faced at the hands of Singh - a case which has finally been taken up in court after months of protests. That it had to be internalised, was an added shackle in her career and she has not shied away from any of the questions asked over.\n\n\"If I raised my voice, he'd never have let me reach this level. Me and everyone else kept quiet because we didn't have any other option,\" she says of the oft-asked \"why now\" question. (which in itself betrays the deep lack of understanding of gender dynamics that she has shed light in)\n\n\"Jab paani sar se upar chala jaata hain (when the water rises over your head), there comes a time when you must say something. We used to hear stories from our juniors and then we realised that we must raise our voices now. Our juniors won't because they will have the same fears that we did. We are financially secure, there's a strength to our voices now, people will listen. The sexual harassment in the federation can be stopped [by them] so we decided if we don't raise our voices no one will.\"\n\nThe fight, which she concedes is slow-moving, is still on, and she wants to see it to its conclusion.\n\nShe's even open to entering the administration, something she wasn't willing to before because it would subvert the purpose of the protests. She has the capability, and education - something she that gives her an edge because not many of her peers balanced academics.\n\nHer inclination to improve the lives and careers of young women in the field, many of whom she trains at her father-in-law's academy, goes beyond wanting to give back to sport. With Sakshi, the advocacy goes deeper. Her description of body image issues, financial literacy, stereotyping of certain women's grooming, covert sexual harassment is applicable to every field in India, not just sports. Almost all women have dealt with this in some form.\n\nWitness, such an aptly titled memoir, is Sakshi Malik's message to Indian sportswomen (and men) about things they should know but no one would tell them straight.\n\n*Witness, by Sakshi Malik with Jonathan Selvaraj, is published by Juggernaut Books",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nVinesh Phogat is now an MLA, having been elected to the Haryana Assembly on Tuesday. She was elected from the Julana assembly constituency, which she contested as a candidate of the Congress party, by a margin of more than with 6,000 votes. After her win, Vinesh said: : \"This is the fight of every girl, every woman who chooses the path to fight. This is the victory of every struggle, of truth. I will maintain the love and trust that this country has given me.\n\n\"This was a people's battle, and they've won and I was just a face. I am thankful to all the love and respect that I've received.\"\n\nShe defeated, among others, the Bharatiya Janata Party's Captain Yogesh Bairagi, a former Army officer, the incumbent MLA and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) candidate Amarjeet Dhanda, and also former professional wrestler Kavita Dalal from the Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nThis was the Congress's first win in Julana since 2005; the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) had won this seat from 2009 to 2019. Olympic medallist Bajrang Punia, who with Vinesh spearheaded the protest against former wrestling federation chief and ex-BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, was among the first to congratulate her. \"Many congratulations to the country's daughter Vinesh Phogat for her victory. This fight was not just for one Julana seat, it was not just with 3-4 other candidates, it was not just a fight between parties. This fight was against the strongest oppressive forces in the country. And Vinesh emerged victorious,\" he wrote on X.\n\nBefore the election result, Vinesh said she and her political party will fight for the rights of women and will focus on curbing unemployment in the state. Vinesh, who won multiple gold medals for India at the World Championships, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games, quit wrestling after her disqualification from the Paris Olympics for weighing 100 grams over the permissible limit on the morning of her gold medal bout.\n\nThe case went to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS), who later dismissed the appeal for a joint-silver medal for Vinesh. The CAS stated that despite the consequences of a failed second weigh-in was draconian, it was on athletes to ensure that they are within the permissible weight limits for their respective events.\n\nBefore the Olympics, Vinesh, along with Sakshi Malik and Bajrang, spearheaded the protests against Brij Bhushan, which ultimately led to the filing of sexual harassment charges on the former federation chief.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThat is very much that, then. Across a 24-page document, sole arbitrator Annabelle Bennett comprehensively recorded Vinesh Phogat's case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and ended it with her final decision: \"In view of the above considerations, the Applicant's Application filed on 7 August 2024 shall be dismissed.\" No joint-silver, nothing, as we had predicted since CAS released its brief verdict on August 14.\n\nThere is, though, a potential silver lining here, because a reading of the detailed judgement shows there is scope for a relook at the laws that govern weigh-ins at big wrestling events. Vinesh will not get her medal, but similar incidents can be prevented in the future.\n\nThere are enough indications in the detailed verdict that Bennett disagreed with the rules but, as she explained, her hands were tied. This was the most striking: \"The consequences of the failed second weigh-in, which do not arise from any illegal or wrongful act on the part of the Applicant are, in the opinion of the Sole Arbitrator, draconian.\"\n\nSince the validity of said rule was not being contested, she said, there was nothing much she could do about it; instead, she subtly put the onus on United World Wrestling (UWW), the global governing body, to revisit its laws.\n\nVinesh's ouster may have been correct as per the rules, as Bennett pointed out, but the outpouring of support and empathy for her from across the world of wrestling and beyond suggests it's time for a change. Here are some rules the UWW could start with.\n\nOne-day weigh-in as opposed to two-day weigh-ins\n\nVinesh competed on August 6 at the Paris Olympics because she made the weigh-in on the first day. That much is accepted by all parties. Now, why does wrestling mandate a second weigh-in for a competitor who's already made the cut for the first bout? Considering the health risks associated with weight cuts, wouldn't it be advisable to have the athlete continue through the tournament without any further weigh-ins? Especially since it's just a two-day affair.\n\nWrestling had always been a single-day affair from the first round to the final until 2017 when the two-day format was introduced. Under the new rule, a strict no-allowance weigh-in on the first day was followed by a weigh-in on the second day that had a two-kilogram allowance.\n\nSkipping, sauna, sparring, cutting her hair: How Vinesh tried to get her weight down\n\nRather ironically, one of the highlighted aims for that change was to reduce the need for drastic weight cuts, so that wrestlers may compete closer to their natural weight. UWW president Nenad Lalovic had said at the time, \"I [..] believe these new rules will also encourage healthier wrestlers.\"\n\nVinesh Phogat became the first Indian woman wrestler to reach an Olympic final at the 2024 Paris Games. EPA/YAHYA ARHAB\n\nThe logic was that dividing it over two days meant that athletes wouldn't lose a huge amount of weight in one day and compete, but an important part of that was the 2kg allowance on the second day. If the concept of the daily weigh-in can't be dropped (even boxing has daily weigh-ins on the morning of the bouts), revisiting the original 2017 format would be a start.\n\nStrangely, while dropping the 2kg provision from the Olympics (without any explanation), the UWW itself follows this rule in certain \"international tournaments\" like the World Cup. Why not extend it to the Olympic Games? Whatever the reasoning behind allowing this tolerance at other events, surely that could be extended to the single most important tournament in the sport.\n\nStaggered weigh-ins for different wrestlers\n\nAt the Olympics, each wrestler must make weight ahead of the morning session. While this makes sense for those competing in that session, for finalists who only compete late in the evening session (such as in Vinesh's case), why can't there be an afternoon weigh-in? Considering how little effort it requires from the administrator's side and how big an impact it could make on the athlete's health and physical condition, this could be a provision that's explored.\n\nExplained: Why was Vinesh Phogat disqualified from Paris Olympics?\n\nSeemingly, all the weigh-ins are done at the same point since UWW referees and officials need to be present at the time of the weigh-in. Surely, though, the global body can manage to conduct an additional, smaller-scale weigh-in in the afternoon for finalists who compete later. That would give the wrestlers, who have put on weight after the Day 1 weigh-in thanks to rehydration and nutrition, sufficient time to lose weight. In Vinesh's case, specifically, she would most likely have shed the excess 100 grams of weight and been cleared for her final.\n\nCater to the biological differences between women and men\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) tried to argue that \"the biological difference in the bodies of male and female wrestlers, particularly in light of the menstruation of women, needs to be taken into account whilst determining the eligibility of female wrestlers on the second day of the weigh-in\".\n\nBennett dismissed the IOA's argument, stating that it was \"unquantified\", and that \"the effects of any such differences [between male and female bodies], and of steps to mitigate such effects, are speculative and unsupported by evidence and cannot be considered for the purposes of this Application.\" This is a reasonable statement.\n\nDavid Ramos/Getty Images\n\nWhy not quantify it, though? Why not have supportive evidence to back the anecdotal? To do this would take very specific studies to be conducted on women's physiology (as against generalising based on men's), for each Olympic weight class. Such a scientific approach would only help the athletes -- which should be the prime consideration of the governing body.\n\nVinesh Phogat has a bigger fight, if she wants it: saving Indian wrestling\n\nSports science has progressed over the years, and an in-depth study of many aspects unique to female physiology -- like how menstrual cycles affect weight retention -- can be commissioned.\n\nFor instance, multiple focused studies have shown how women footballers are more prone to ACL injuries (4-6 times more) due to various factors, all of which can be quantified: ligamentous laxity, hormonal influences, neuromuscular imbalances, biomechanical alignment, and intercondylar notch width. The study of this has helped advocate for different training methodologies for women - like managing the greater imbalance between hamstring and quadricep strength. It's also helping in the design of boots specific to women footballers (wider around the toes, narrower at the heel and more support around the arch).\n\nThere are visible changes in the way sport is played too - the three-point line in the WNBA is 20'6\" from the basket, in the NBA it is 23'9\", and they use different-sized balls (size 6 vs size 7). In Olympic track and field, the men's shotput is 7.26 kg, the women's is 4 kg, the women's hurdle is 2'9\" high, while the men's is 3'6\". A volleyball net is at 2.43m for men and 2.24m for women.\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nThese sweeping differences, though, are not necessary for wrestling as it stands. What we are calling for here is to adopt a more scientific approach -- like football is starting to adopt -- to take a relook at certain rules and regulations that clearly were designed for men (look at the looseness of language in the regulations, where the pronoun 'he' is often used by itself) and rework those for women.\n\nIs the 'punishment' proportional?\n\n\"The Sole Arbitrator observes that the Athlete entered the field of play and fought and won three rounds and reached the final of the 50 kg wrestling competition at the Paris Olympic Games before she failed the second weigh-in and was ineligible to compete in the final. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.\"\n\nNo wrongdoing. And yet, a finalist of the Games walks away without a medal. There is an inherent injustice here that UWW can ensure won't happen in the future -- the striking down of the \"draconian\" rule that states failing of the second weigh-in disqualifies the athlete from the entire competition. In Vinesh's case, she was below the 50kg limit on day 1, and she pulled off three remarkable wins on that day -- surely, it's reasonable to suggest that we consider that for the final result? Don't let the athlete compete on day 2 if they don't make weight, but don't erase day 1's triumphs either.\n\nBefore Vinesh Phogat the icon was Vinesh Phogat the champion wrestler\n\nVinesh Phogat takes down defending champion Yui Susaki in her opening bout at Paris Olympics LUIS ROBAYO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nLet's continue with the Vinesh example -- if we are voiding her results from day 1, couldn't the great Yui Susaki claim on good grounds that she's as entitled to advance to the gold medal match as the wrestler who was promoted to it, Yusneylis Guzman Lopez? Having come into the Games with an 82-0 record in international competition, it stands to reason that she would have been the favourite to advance if she'd been given a chance to take on Lopez (like she showed by beating Vinesh's quarterfinal opponent Oksana Livach in repechage). If Vinesh is ranked last, with no wins, Susaki has a logical claim for a route to the final as well.\n\nParis' boxing unit regulations, for instance, state that: \"If a Boxer fails the Medical Examination or Daily Weigh-In, his/her opponent will win by WO,\" but there is no mention of taking a medal away from them (in boxing, entering semifinals guarantees a medal). It stands to reason from the reading of the rules that a boxer who didn't make the daily weigh-in ahead of the final would forfeit the final by walkover, but still be awarded a silver medal.\n\nNow, implementing changes as suggested in the previous points may take time, but in the meantime, this is one disproportionate punishment that can be removed with a simple press of the backspace key.\n\nThe Vinesh Phogat case is a unique one, and while retrospectively addressing it may well be impossible, it can be used as the springboard for change.",
