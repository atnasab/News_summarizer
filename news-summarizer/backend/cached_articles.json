                "text": "YouTube and TikTok star MrBeast is looking to buy TikTok as part of a group of investors, as a 75-day time limit ticks down for the social media company to find a non-Chinese owner or risk being permanently banned.\n\n\u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll buy Tik Tok so it doesn\u2019t get banned,\u201d MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, posted on X on January 13th. But while his tone was joking, Donaldson \u2013 the single most popular YouTuber and the third-most popular TikToker \u2013 was serious, his lawyer told CNN Tuesday.\n\nThe bid from Donaldson and a group of investors is just the latest twist in what\u2019s been an extraordinary few days for TikTok.\n\nIt went dark on Saturday night as a nationwide ban was looming but was back online about 12 hours later, after President Donald Trump announced he would sign an executive order to delay the ban by 75 days.\n\nTwo days after his post on X, Donaldson posted a video on TikTok, where he announced his intention to buy the social media platform.\n\n\u201cI just got out of a meeting with a bunch of billionaires. , TikTok we mean business,\u201d Mr. Beast said in the video. \u201cThis is my lawyer right here, we have an offer ready for you, we want to buy the platform.\u201d\n\nThe bid comes in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the federal law banning TikTok unless it is sold to a non-China-based company, a spokepserson for the Paul Hastings law firm, which represents the consortium in the bid, told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe investor group, which is led by Jesse Tinsley, the founder and CEO of Employer.com, is made up of \u201cinstitutional investors and high-net-worth individuals , \u201d who don\u2019t want to see the app go away.\n\nThe proposal would not disrupt TikTok\u2019s operations and would ensure continuity for its 170 million American users, according to the investor group.\n\n\u201cOur offer represents a win-win solution that preserves this vital platform, while addressing legitimate national security concerns,\u201d said Tinsley in a statement. The statement did not disclose the amount of the bid.\n\nCNN has reached out to TikTok for comment.\n\nTime is running out\n\nTalks about a possible TikTok sale to a US-based company have been circulating since 2020, when President Trump, during his first term in the White House, issued an executive order attempting to ban TikTok.\n\nLast week, after the Supreme Court unanimously agreed to uphold a federal law banning TikTok unless ByteDance, its parent company, sells the platform to a non-China-based company.\n\nTikTok went dark on Saturday, as a message on the app read: \u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now. A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now.\u201d\n\nThe app was back online after Trump announced he would sign an executive order following his inauguration Monday in order to \u201cextend the period of time before the law\u2019s prohibitions take effect.\u201d\n\nWhile the executive order, which was signed Monday evening, delays the enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days, it does not provide a permanent solution.\n\nByteDance will either sell to a new buyer\u2014despite stating it has no intention of doing so\u2014or the Trump administration would need to enact a new law to overturn the previous one, an improbable scenario given the strong bipartisan support the existing legislation received in Congress.\n\nTikTok bids coming in hot\n\nChinese officials have been considering selling at least a portion of the app to tech tycoon Elon Musk, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported. CNN has not independently confirmed the discussions, and both ByteDance and Elon Musk did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nA group called \u201cThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok\u201d which includes Shark Tank\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Leary and billionaire Frank McCourt, has also offered to buy TikTok.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bid is backed by investments from Guggenheim Securities as well as world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nTikTok\u2019s US assets, without the algorithm, are estimated to be worth between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\nBut since the algorithm may be where much of TikTok\u2019s value lies, putting a firm dollar figure on the company is difficult.\n\nMcCourt\u2019s group is not saying publicly how much it offered, although the billionaire previously indicated he valued the assets at around $20 billion.\n\n\u201cWe will refrain from publicly sharing the financial specifics of our offer until ByteDance is in a position to review our proposal,\u201d O\u2019Leary and McCourt\u2019s group said in a statement last week.",

                "title": "Tariffs on China are coming on Feb. 1, Trump warns",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that even more tariffs could be coming as soon as next week: This time China was his target, as Trump threatened to unleash a wave of higher taxes on imports from America\u2019s second-biggest trading partner.\n\nIn an Oval Office press conference that echoed similar off-the-cuff remarks on Monday, Trump said that he is considering a 10% across-the-board tariff on all Chinese goods starting as early as February 1. On Monday, Trump threatened 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada but deflected on China, noting that former President Joe Biden left in place extensive tariffs that Trump imposed during his first administration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted such a rapid change in Trump\u2019s tariff policy, although he had promised as much as a 60% tariff on all goods imported from China during his campaign. Trump said Tuesday that too much fentanyl is coming into the United States from China via Mexico and Canada and that the threat of tariffs could get China to crack down on the deadly drug.\n\n\u201cI had that talk with President Xi the other day too, of China. I said, we don\u2019t want that crap in our country. We got to stop it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a tariff of 10% on China based on the fact that they\u2019re sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated Tuesday a common refrain that in his first term he had a deal in place with Xi in which China agreed to impose the death penalty on drug dealers caught funneling drugs into the United States, but he said Biden failed to follow up on the proposal. Trump didn\u2019t explicitly demand China execute convicted drug dealers as a condition of avoiding tariffs.\n\nOn Monday, Trump issued an executive action that directed the secretaries of commerce and the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to investigate the causes of America\u2019s trade deficits with foreign nations, to determine how to build an \u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d to collect tariffs, to identify unfair trade practices and to review existing trade agreements for potential improvements. It also calls for a review of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (the USMCA) signed by Trump in his first term and requires agencies to assess whether stricter US trade policy could successfully restrict the flow of fentanyl and the flow of undocumented migrants into the United States.\n\nBut the action did not specifically call for an increase in tariffs. As a candidate, Trump proposed sweeping and across-the-board tariffs: up to 20% on imports from all countries, with a 25% tax on goods from Mexico and Canada, plus a 60% tariff on goods from China. He also pledged to use tariffs as a negotiating tool on other countries, including, for example, Denmark \u2014 putting pressure on the European nation to give control of Greenland to the United States. (He also did not rule out using the military to take Greenland.)\n\nThe delay made investors happy Tuesday, sending the Dow more than 500 points higher. Wall Street is generally opposed to tariffs, because American importers pay the tariffs at the ports, passing those costs along to businesses and consumers. They can be inflationary \u2013 a particularly worrying notion considering America is still feeling the effects of the inflation crisis from the past few years.\n\nVarious factions of Trump\u2019s economic team have been working to decide the best way to roll out tariffs.\n\nMarket-minded officials like Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary, and Kevin Hassett, his pick to lead the National Economic Council, have advocated for a softer approach. Tariff champions such as Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, and Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Commerce Department, have argued the full bore is needed to send the message Trump wants.\n\nTrump has been calling allies on Capitol Hill to shore up support for tariffs. Although the specific policy has yet to be decided, Trump could be putting his thumb on the scale with these off-the-cuff announcements.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Istanbul, Turkey CNN \u2014\n\nDozens of people were killed after a fire ripped through a ski resort hotel in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, forcing desperate holidaymakers to leap from windows to escape from the flames and smoke.\n\nAt least 76 people were killed and 51 injured following the early morning blaze at a hotel in the Kartalkaya resort in Bolu province, according to Turkey\u2019s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya. Many children are believed to be among the victims. Authorities have identified 52 of the deceased, Yerlikaya said.\n\nAs the identities of some of the victims emerged, local schools and businesses started to post death notices for students and educational staff. Some were reported to be fifth graders, aged 10 to 11 years old.\n\n\u201cWe are in deep pain. We have unfortunately lost 66 lives in the fire that broke out at this hotel,\u201d Yerlikaya told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared Wednesday a day of mourning. \u201cToday is not a day for politics; it is a day for solidarity, for being one and together,\u201d he said on X, adding that anyone found responsible would be held to account.\n\nOfficials said some desperate holiday goers had tried to jump out of windows in order to escape, as flames licked the top floors of the facility. Footage of the aftermath showed wreaths of gray smoke swirling around the charred building.\n\nThe 12-story hotel was built onto a cliff, complicating efforts to extinguish the flames. Emergency crews arrived at the scene at 4:15 a.m. local time \u2013 almost an hour after the fire broke out \u2013 at 3:27 a.m. local time, said Yerlikaya. Turkey\u2019s government launched an investigation into the fire, and at least nine people have been detained, according to Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc and the interior minister.\n\nEyewitnesses recalled the scent of burning, with guests\u2019 screams filling the upper floors of the hotel. Others said the hotel\u2019s fire detection service failed to work. A number of videos, some shared on social media and others broadcast by Turkish TV stations, showed flames coming out of the top floors of the hotel. Some people were seen using tied bed sheets to try to escape the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt was so bad. Everybody was jumping out of the windows with the fear of death and people were so ashamed as there were no fire-extinguishers around,\u201d one eyewitness told CNN affiliate CNN Turk.\n\n\u201cWe could not get water to people. Ambulances and fire trucks came really late, and people did not know what to do,\u201d the eyewitness added.\n\nA guest staying on the third floor of the hotel said the alarm failed to sound, the Associated Press reported, citing the IHA news agency.\n\n\u201cMy wife smelled the burning\u2026 We tried to go upstairs but couldn\u2019t, there were flames,\u201d said Atakan Yelkovan. \u201cPeople on the upper floors were screaming. They hung down the sheets\u2026 Some tried to jump.\u201d\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish the fire at the hotel in Kartalkaya. Mert Ozkan/Reuters\n\nThe resort is a popular destination for holiday-makers in the winter, especially during school holidays, which run from January until the first week of February. The timing of the blaze fell in the school holidays, when people from Istanbul and Ankara travel to the Bolu mountains to ski.\n\nThere were around 234 guests staying at the hotel, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency. Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building \u201cin a panic,\u201d Aydin said.\n\nAt least 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site, Aydin\u2019s office said. According to Yerlikaya, authorities mobilized 267 emergency personnel to respond to the blaze. Authorities evacuated other hotels at the resort as a precautionary measure, and guests were housed in hotels around Bolu.",

Dressed in a black suit, the 40-year-old also posed for photos next to a Ferrari F40 supercar.\n\n\u201cThere are some days that you know you\u2019ll remember forever and today, my first as a Ferrari driver, is one of those days,\u201d Hamilton wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to have achieved things in my career I never thought possible, but part of me has always held on to that dream of racing in red. I couldn\u2019t be happier to realise that dream today.\n\n\u201cToday we start a new era in the history of this iconic team, and I can\u2019t wait to see what story we will write together.\u201d\n\nHamilton met members of his new team at a Ferrari factory in Maranello, Italy. Scuderia Ferrari/PA\n\nHamilton, who currently shares the record for the most F1 world titles with Michael Schumacher, joined Mercedes in 2013 after beginning his career with McLaren in 2007.\n\nHe won six of his seven world titles at Mercedes before triggering a release clause in his contract last year, deciding instead to replace Carloz Sainz at the Scuderia.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Sport last year, Hamilton said he had no regrets during his time at Mercedes.\n\n\u201cWe created history together.

                "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe rugged Annamite Mountains, which stretch across Laos, Vietnam and northeast Cambodia, are renowned for their rich biodiversity. Nestled in the southwest of the range lies Virachey, Cambodia\u2019s largest national park.\n\nThe remote region is vast, covering more than 3,000 square kilometers, yet despite it being a protected area, it is largely unexplored and understudied. The first comprehensive biodiversity survey of the park was published on Tuesday, revealing the rare and threatened species that live there, including the Sunda pangolin, the clouded leopard and the sun bear.\n\nLed by conservation organization Fauna & Flora, which describes the Annamites as the \u201cAmazon of Asia,\u201d the survey also documented nine species that have never been recorded in Cambodia before, such as the critically endangered large-antlered muntjac, Sokolov\u2019s glass lizard and the Vietnamese leaf-toed gecko.\n\nThe critically endangered large-antlered muntjac was photographed by camera trap in Virachey National Park, the species' first ever recorded sighting in Cambodia. Fauna & Flora\n\n\u201cThe area had been virtually unexplored and there was almost no information about the biodiversity of Virachey National Park,\u201d Pablo Sinovas, country director of Fauna & Flora\u2019s Cambodia program, told CNN over a video call. \u201cWe found several threatened species that, by definition, are not doing very well globally or within the country. This park has the potential to provide a good stronghold to make sure that they don\u2019t go extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way, it\u2019s kind of a Noah\u2019s Ark of wildlife,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the park faces a range of threats including deforestation, forest degradation, habitat fragmentation and snaring (using thin wire nooses to catch animals). Over the past three decades, Cambodia has lost more than 30% of its primary forest cover, and despite being established as a national park in 1993, investigations by non-profits claim to have uncovered large-scale illegal logging within Virachey.\n\nSinovas hopes that the biodiversity data will help to strengthen the management of the park and conservation strategies. \u201c(The survey) confirmed the relevance of the area as a biodiversity hotspot and put some of these species on the map, so to speak, which means we can conserve them in a more targeted way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first step: knowing what is present is necessary to be able to protect it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRare and exciting\u201d\n\nThe remoteness of the park made gathering data a challenge, so the team used a range of methods over several years, compiling multiple studies. It worked closely with local indigenous communities, who Sinovas said \u201cknow the forest best,\u201d but even they had never set foot in some of the areas that were being surveyed.\n\nMore than 150 camera traps were deployed to record elusive species, such as the large-antlered muntjac, which was caught on camera in 2021. While the deer species was first described in 1994, it had previously only been documented in Laos and Vietnam.\n\n\u201cTo find a large mammal in a country for the first time is really quite rare and exciting,\u201d said Sinovas.\n\nA pig-tailed macaque photographed during a camera trap survey in Virachey National Park. Fauna & Flora\n\nThe camera traps also helped identify threats, for instance the presence of domestic dogs in some areas and the use of snare traps; some threatened species, like the Asiatic black bear and the northern pig-tailed macaque, were photographed with missing limbs.\n\nThe team extracted DNA from water samples and tested it to reveal the presence of 161 species, including the dwarf loach (an endangered freshwater fish), the Asiatic softshell turtle and the Asian black bear. It also carried out specific population assessments for some species, such as the northern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon, an endangered primate only found in forested areas of southern Laos, northern Cambodia and central Vietnam. The survey estimated that there are around 2,000 groups of gibbon in Virachey National Park, making it the species\u2019 most important stronghold.\n\nSinovas also highlighted the park\u2019s value in providing a livelihood to local people and as a carbon sink.\n\n\u201cThis park sits at the core of one of the largest forests in mainland Southeast Asia: that\u2019s important for biodiversity, but also for climate in terms of carbon absorption,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also important from a human perspective \u2026 around the borders of the park, there are indigenous communities that had been relying on the natural resources from the area for a long time. It is essential that those resources are preserved and continue to be managed sustainably.\u201d\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThey\u2019d been friends for years, but everything changed for Austin Mullins and Jack Richards, both from the US, when they took a trip to New York\u2019s Fire Island together back in 2020.\n\nReturning to NYC very much a couple, the pair moved in together and got engaged two years later.\n\nIn January 2023, Austin and Jack, who first met at a party back in 2016, relocated from the Big Apple to Uruguay.\n\nThey\u2019ve been living there happily for the past two years and are now permanent residents of the South American country.\n\n\u2018Special place\u2019\n\nThe couple are now happily living in capital city Montevideo. ivotheeditors/iStock Editorial/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe love it here and find it to be a really special place,\u201d says Austin.\n\nSo why did this thirty-something couple decide to relocate to one of the smallest countries in South America?\n\nAustin and Jack say it all began during the pandemic, when they spent a lot of time watching TV together at their apartment.\n\n\u201cWe got addicted to a television show called \u2018Escape to the Chateau,\u2019\u201d says Jack. \u201cMost of our American friends had never heard of it.\u201d\n\nAs they continually tuned into the British reality show, which is centered around a couple who buy and renovate a 19th-century French chateau, Austin and Jack became intrigued by the idea of \u201cbuying some crumbly old piece of property and renovating it.\u201d\n\nHowever, living in a rural town \u201cdidn\u2019t sound appealing.\u201d\n\n\u201cEurope was appealing,\u201d says Austin. \u201cBut then we realized that we needed to go somewhere that we can learn a language that\u2019s going to be useful.\u201d\n\nDeciding that Spanish would be the most beneficial language for them to learn, they narrowed their list down to relevant destinations.\n\nAlthough Spain was a consideration, they eventually vetoed the European country due to the fact that Jack, who runs a digital marketing agency, would be working remotely, and most of their clients were based in the US. They therefore started looking south.\n\n\u201cI brought up Uruguay,\u201d says Austin, explaining that he\u2019d previously visited the country, although Jack hadn\u2019t at that point. \u201dAnd so we started researching the culture here.\n\n\u201cThe political climate. The economic climate. And it all is favorable. It\u2019s on all these lists of great places to go.\u201d\n\nAside from being attracted to Uruguay\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d LGBTQ protections and \u201cstable political system,\u201d they also found that the country was home to various aging properties that they could potentially renovate.\n\n\u201cIt answered all of the things that a chateau in France didn\u2019t answer,\u201d says Jack, referencing the nightlife and culture of capital city Montevideo. \u201cAnd we still have an airport that we can fly in and out of.\u201d\n\nBig move\n\nThe couple with Austin's grandmother Bonnie and friend Jennifer, far right, at the top of City Hall of Montevideo last year. Jack Richards\n\nAustin and Jack had originally hoped to move to Uruguay for a few months to test things out. But after talking to their accountants, they realised that being out of the US for more than 11 months in a 12-month period, would save them \u201ca big chunk of change\u201d on their taxes.\n\nBefore leaving New York, the couple, who had been engaged since April 2022, decided to tie the knot.\n\n\u201cWe just did a courthouse wedding, to both of our mothers\u2019 chagrin,\u201d says Jack, adding that they brought just one person to act as a witness along with them.\n\nAfter visiting their families to \u201cget some time in before leaving the country,\u201d they packed up their stuff and threw a going away party, and spent New Year\u2019s Eve of 2022 dropping in to parties to say goodbye to various friends.\n\nA week later, the couple flew to Montevideo, Uruguay, to begin their new lives. They initially arrived on a tourist visa, which allowed them to stay for 90 days.\n\nBut although they were hugely excited after taking such a giant leap together, Austin and Jack\u2019s first few weeks in the country didn\u2019t turn out quite as they\u2019d imagined.\n\n\u201cJanuary is strange, because January here is kind of August in Paris,\u201d explains Austin. \u201cThe streets are deserted\u2026 So we\u2019re like, \u2018Ok. Where is everybody?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hot, but there\u2019s no-one at the beach. All the restaurants are closed. So it felt very odd.\u201d\n\nThankfully things began to pick up in mid-February, when \u201ccarnival starts, and the city becomes much more alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of music around. There\u2019s lots of things to see,\u201d says Austin. \u201cSo we started to feel a little bit more like, \u2018OK, the city is waking up.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the time March came around, Montevideo was even livelier and they were finally able to get a real taste of life in the city.\n\nWhile the couple were keen to find a big property to become their renovation project, they say they struggled to find a bank that would grant a sizable mortgage to two non-nationals earning money outside of the country.\n\nRealizing that they\u2019d have to put their \u201cEscape to the Chateau\u201d dream on hold, Austin and Jack, who stayed in at least four Airbnbs before moving to their current home, settled on renting an apartment in a neighborhood named Parque Rod\u00f3.\n\n\u201cWe love this area,\u201d says Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s a five-minute walk from a very beautiful park in the city and 10 minutes to the beach.\u201d\n\nAfter discovering that most of the rental leases in the country were for a two-year duration, the couple say they were initially hesitant about committing for such a long period of time.\n\n\u201cHere, no-one is willing to give you a one-year lease,\u201d says Austin. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we really had to make the commitment to stay for two full years.\u201d\n\nOnce they\u2019d pledged to remain in Uruguay longer term, they slowly began to feel more at home and less like they were on an extended vacation.\n\nSettling in\n\nAustin and Jack say they are very happy in the South American country. Jack Richards\n\nWhile the locals have been \u201cextremely kind and patient,\u201d, Austin and Jack say they\u2019ve found Uruguayan culture to be \u201cpretty insular\u201d and haven\u2019t made any Uruguayan friends as yet.\n\n\u201cAll of our friends are other nationalities,\u201d says Jack. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve talked about with them.\n\n\u201cUruguayans are really nice, but especially people born and raised in the city of Montevideo, tend to only befriend people that they\u2019ve known for their entire lives\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd it is really, really challenging to ever get invited to their home or to be part of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe couple go on to explain that they\u2019ve found it easier to develop friendships with Uruguayans who were born outside of the city.\n\nAs for the language, both are currently learning Spanish, but stress that they are \u201cfar from fluent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up in Arizona, so I had a bit of an introduction to Spanish, but Mexican Spanish,\u201d says Jack. \u201cAnd Uruguayan Spanish is very different.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Austin, who moved to Uruguay \u201cknowing no Spanish whatsoever,\u201d says he\u2019s been pleasantly surprised by his improvement over time and hopes that this will continue.\n\n\u201cLanguage is definitely a barrier to integrating more with the locals,\u201d adds Austin. \u201cThat\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\nAccording to Austin and Jack, Uruguay\u2019s slower-paced lifestyle has been both \u201ca blessing and a curse\u201d for them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of urgency here,\u201d says Jack, before explaining that the process of gaining residence permits in the country was much slower than they expected.\n\n\u201cSo coming from New York, where everything is fast-paced all the time, to here. It is nice to slow down, but at some points it would be nice if Uruguay would speed up a little.\u201d\n\nBoth feel that they have a healthier lifestyle now due to the better access to fresh fruit and vegetables, which they\u2019ve found to be less costly, and the fact that they are getting \u201cmore daylight and fresh air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe eat fresh fruit and vegetables all day, year round,\u201d says Austin. \u201cThat\u2019s something that was not common in New York\u2026 So that has been a big improvement.\u201d\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve found Uruguay to be more affordable overall, they point out that locals earning local salaries may feel differently.\n\n\u201cWe pay way less to live here than New York, and probably way less than even most places in the US,\u201d says Austin.\n\n\u201cBut compared to the rest of South America, costs tend to be high. And even for locals, costs are high.\n\n\u201cBecause there is that kind of lack of job opportunities and so the ratio of how expensive something is, like internet to income, is a lot higher here than maybe other places in South America.\n\nWhen it comes to cultural differences, Austin and Jack say they\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s \u201ca lot less toxic masculinity\u201d in Uruguay.\n\n\u201cEven straight men kiss each other on the cheek to say \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018goodbye,\u2019\u201d says Jack.\n\nThey\u2019ve also found the culture to be quite similar to European culture and less like the rest of Latin America.\n\n\u201cBeing so small, it has a different quality to it, that they\u2019re very proud of,\u201d says Austin. \u201cBut they\u2019re also aware of the world outside of that, and they know that that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nOvercoming challenges\n\nThe couple say that the challenges they've faced since relocating have brought them closer together. Courtesy Jack Richards\n\nThe US State Department currently advises travelers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d while visiting Uruguay due to crime, noting that \u201cviolent crimes, such as homicides, armed robberies, car jackings, and theft\u201d occur throughout the country.\n\nAustin and Jack admit that they didn\u2019t consider the issue of safety before choosing to relocate there, and stress that they\u2019ve never felt particularly at risk while living in Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe US doesn\u2019t classify Uruguay as a safe place,\u201d says Jack, noting that while violent crime is prevalent in some areas of the country, he finds that this is \u201csmall and isolated compared to the everyday lives of most people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how their friends and family feel about their choice of destination, Jack points out that many of them don\u2019t seem to know much about Uruguay and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to locate it on a map.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of people who are like, \u2018Oh, how\u2019s Paraguay?\u2019\u201d they say. \u201cI had one person who asked, \u2018How\u2019s life in Uganda?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge the couple has faced is undoubtedly the fact that only one of them is currently working full time.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty here has been me finding employment,\u201d says Austin, explaining that while he\u2019s found some work teaching English, he hasn\u2019t been able to secure a long-term position.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been kind of the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re not retirement age\u2026\u201d\n\nThis ultimately means that things are a little \u201cup in the air\u201d in terms of the couple\u2019s future in Uruguay.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to ever get our chateau dream, that\u2019s where having the dual income would help,\u201d says Jack.\n\n\u201cBecause we can live, and have lived for the last two years very comfortably, just off of my primary income and Austin teaching.\n\n\u201cAnd that would be sustainable for a while. But it would not allow us to escape to the chateau.\u201d\n\nWhile they admit that the situation has been a strain on their marriage, Austin and Jack say that it\u2019s ultimately brought them closer together.\n\n\u201cThe strain of it has also forced us to be stronger,\u201d says Jack, pointing out that they have a couple\u2019s therapist in Uruguay as well as individual therapists.\n\nAustin echoes this statement, conceding that while things have been stressful at times, they\u2019ve \u201clearned to navigate a lot of difficulties\u201d together.\n\n\u201cWe need each other here,\u201d adds Austin.\n\nAlthough they\u2019re happy in Uruguay, Jack and Austin haven\u2019t ruled out the prospect of returning to the US one day, particularly if Austin continues to struggle to find work.\n\n\u201cThe other thing is aging parents and grandparents,\u201d says Jack. \u201cI think if either of us had a family health emergency, that would be a big indicator of whether we stay or not.\u201d\n\nThey stress that having the freedom to return to the United States regularly, as well as \u201cvisit most other Western countries, at will\u201d is a privilege that they don\u2019t take lightly.\n\n\u201cFor example, in two years, we\u2019ve gone back to visit family a few times compared to a friend from Venezuela who left eight years ago, hasn\u2019t been back, and doesn\u2019t anticipate ever being able to return,\u201d says Jack.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t want to move back to the US for our own quality of life and political reasons, it is still seen as a land of opportunity to many people.\n\n\u201cAnd while some would give almost anything to live outside their country of birth, we have the freedom to choose.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, they\u2019re happy to remain in Uruguay and keep \u201cworking towards the chateau.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re accepting donations!\u201d jokes Austin.",

                "title": "Why Trump\u2019s two days in the White House already feel like a full term",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIt already feels like he\u2019s been back for months.\n\nDonald Trump is setting a frenetic pace in his second term, fulfilling campaign promises, imposing undiluted power and settling scores.\n\nAfter the sedate Joe Biden years, the return of a presidency that is an incessant assault on the senses is a reminder of why so many millions of Americans see Trump as a compelling, historic figure \u2013 and why millions more deeply fear him.\n\nTrump has cracked down hard on immigration, held a splashy $500 billion tech investment announcement, renamed the Gulf of Mexico, outlawed much of the diversity policy in the federal government, shopped around TikTok, fired people by social media post, mooted territorial expansion, threatened a trade war, talked to reporters more than Biden did in months and danced with a sword.\n\nHe\u2019s also mocked the rule of law by freeing January 6, 2021, rioters; lied about the 2020 election; exacted revenge against critics, including by pulling security from an ex-aide threatened by Iran; criticized a bishop; threatened ethics in government; stigmatized trans Americans and cleared the way for ICE arrests in schools and churches.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only been two days.\n\nTrump has notched early success, but the real tests lay ahead\n\nTrump\u2019s velocity is deliberate. So much happens, there\u2019s rarely time to reflect on the gravity of one event. Trivia and world-changing new policies get caught in the whirl. Trump is in the middle of it all, conducting the cacophony and turning up the noise whenever he wants more attention.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s fans, all the activity creates an impression of an endless succession of wins and honored promises. Most people don\u2019t follow politics 24/7, but the stories and imagery that Trump creates filter down through social media, talk radio and local news and refills his political capital. Even when Trump is only trolling the media or Democrats, that\u2019s fine: his base voters who distrust the establishment sent him back to Washington to infuriate and obfuscate.\n\nFor Trump\u2019s foes, it\u2019s hard to know what to get most outraged about. Opposition becomes scattershot, and he skips free of accountability. Nightly compilations of liberals becoming discombobulated over his latest outbursts, meanwhile, fill fawning conservative news shows.\n\nMost new presidencies begin in a flurry of activity, though most emphasize the first 100 days rather than the first 100 hours.\n\nBut Trump has only done the easy part, successfully orchestrating an early rollout. Domestic and international crises lie in wait for a president who has been found wanting in such situations in the past. It\u2019s one thing to sign hundreds of executive orders \u2013 some of which are already facing court challenges \u2013 but real change can only be cemented by passing laws.\n\nThe treacherous task that Trump faces in passing real, lasting change came into focus on Tuesday at his meeting with top Republican congressional leaders. There still does not seem to be a consensus on whether to proceed with one massive bill to push through his agenda or two, smaller vehicles. Either way, nothing is guaranteed given the minuscule GOP majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe first two days have, however, revealed some important trends in the new Trump presidency.\n\nMore organized this time\n\nThe shock and awe of countless executive actions hints at a far more professional White House operation than his chaotic first term. New White House chief of staff Susie Wiles was credited with adding structure to the Trump campaign while not being able to temper his wild, sometimes self-destructive improvisational instincts. Perhaps she can do the same in the West Wing.\n\nAnd unlike during his first few days in office the last time around, Trump knows what he wants to do and how to do it. His good humor after the adulation of his second inauguration \u2013 so-far undimmed by inevitable political setbacks \u2013 has probably helped too.\n\nThe hardline push on immigration\n\nTrump said something very revealing Monday in a speech to supporters about last year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThey all said inflation was the number one issue. I said I disagree. I think people coming into our country from prisons and from mental institutions (is the issue) for the people that I know. And I made it my number one,\u201d Trump said. (There\u2019s no evidence to support his claims about prisons and institutions, but his political point still stands). Trump went on: \u201cI talked about inflation too. But you know, how many times can you say an apple has doubled in cost? I\u2019d say it, and I\u2019d hit it hard, but then I go back to the fact that we don\u2019t want criminals coming into our country.\u201d\n\nTrump is acting on that belief again with an aggressive set of executive actions laying the foundation for his mass deportation program. He\u2019s declared a national emergency that could result in the military going to the border. In a stunning move on Tuesday, he stripped churches and schools of protection from possible ICE arrests. He\u2019s also made it harder for migrants to legally enter the United States by closing down a border app.\n\nIf one goal of Trump\u2019s policy is to create a climate of fear, it may be working. \u201cICE officers are back to doing their job,\u201d the president\u2019s border czar Tom Homan told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Tuesday, revealing how the deportation operation could quickly expand if cities don\u2019t help track fugitive criminals. \u201cWe will find him, but when we find him, he may be with others. Others that don\u2019t have a criminal conviction are in the country illegally. They will be arrested too because we\u2019re not going to strike.\u201d\n\nImmigration is a crowd-pleasing issue for his base, but Trump is taking a risk by prioritizing it since the cost of groceries and housing was one he vowed to fix during the campaign and was especially resonant among swing voters. Trump doesn\u2019t have to run again, but he needs to maintain his coalition to avoid big losses for the GOP in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nIgnoring legal process\n\nOne of the great fears among Trump\u2019s opponents was that if he won back power, especially after claiming to have been the victim of persecution, he\u2019d take the law into his own hands.\n\nThat is already happening as Trump makes lavish use of his pardon power.\n\nThe president fiercely justified giving clemency to more than 1,000 January 6 rioters and was utterly unrepentant about pardoning or commuting the sentences even of those found guilty of assaulting police officers.\n\n\u201cMurderers today are not even charged. You have murderers that aren\u2019t charged all over,\u201d he said Tuesday, as a way of deflecting from questions about the pardons.\n\nTrump also slammed Biden for offering preemptive pardons to family members amid fears they\u2019d be targeted by the new Justice Department. This validated fears among many Democrats that Trump will use Biden\u2019s precedent-shattering move as an excuse to vastly expand his own power. Unlike Biden, however, Trump did at least face the press to explain his position.\n\nLater Tuesday, Trump announced he\u2019d granted yet another pardon \u2013 to Ross William Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road dark web e-commerce site that the Department of Justice had described as \u201cthe most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today.\u201d Pardoning Ulbricht, who had been serving a life sentence, was a favor to the Libertarian movement that supported Trump in the election, the president suggested on Truth Social.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the pardon power in only two days in office will fuel concerns that he\u2019s now effectively acting above the law and that anyone who helps him politically might expect legal advantages.\n\nTrump is looking for deals everywhere\n\nOne of the most notable developments since Trump\u2019s return has been the repeated public messages he\u2019s sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin to convince him to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. After noting Monday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was ready to talk, Trump was asked Tuesday if he\u2019d put new sanctions on the Russian leader if he didn\u2019t play ball. \u201cSounds likely,\u201d he said. There\u2019s no guarantee that Putin is ready to end the conflict, but Trump\u2019s attempts to create leverage come ahead of a likely call between the leaders soon.\n\nTrump has also held off so far on promised tariffs against China, and suggested Monday he was using the threat as leverage before a possible trip to Beijing. And he issued a new threat to the European Union on Tuesday, raising the prospect of yet another trade war, which could be for real or a negotiating tactic. \u201cThey treat us very, very badly. So they\u2019re going to be in for tariffs,\u201d said.\n\nAnd at the end of another exhausting day in the new Trump White House, the president \u2013 who\u2019s seeking to persuade China to sell TikTok \u2013 was asked if he\u2019d like to see tech billionaire Elon Musk, who already has massive conflicts of interest with the government, buy the app.\n\n\u201cI would be if he wanted to buy it,\u201d Trump said.",

                "text": "Washington CNN \u2014\n\nRepublican senators struggled to defend Donald Trump\u2019s decision to commute and pardon hundreds of January 6 protesters, including those who were charged and convicted of crimes against police officers, just hours after the president entered office Monday.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, who has warned before about giving a blanket pardon to the rioters, said, \u201cI just can\u2019t agree\u201d with Trump\u2019s decision to commute the sentences or pardon a vast swath of January 6 insurrection participants.\n\nHe added the move \u201craises a legitimate safety issues on Capitol Hill\u201d before also attacking former President Joe Biden\u2019s pardons in his final hours in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive action, which many GOP senators had hoped would be directed at only nonviolent offenders who entered the Capitol that day, thrust Republicans once again into a familiar posture of navigating how and when to distance themselves from the sitting president and leader of their party. And Republicans largely attempted to sidestep direct questions about whether they personally agreed with Trump\u2019s action, arguing it was up to the president to use his pardon powers at his discretion.\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,000 people who were charged in the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He also commuted the sentences of 14 people in the Proud Boy or Oath Keepers who were charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, sidestepped questions about the pardons, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the future, not the past\u201d when asked whether it was a mistake for Trump.\n\nThe president\u2019s move put Republican senators in the awkward position of having to either defy Trump just hours after he was sworn in inside the US Capitol or defend releasing prisoners who attacked some of the very officers who protect the Capitol every day.\n\nSen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, told CNN he was still digesting the \u201cdetails\u201d of Trump\u2019s pardons and commutations, but pressed on how some of the recipients were responsible for attacking police officers, he said, \u201cI think if you attack a police officer that\u2019s a very serious issue and they should pay a price for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to continue to say we are a party of law and order,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAnd that is incredibly important to be able to protect those folks who are protecting us every single day.\u201d\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, two Republicans who voted to convict Trump after his second impeachment trial in 2021, objected to his decision to give blanket pardons.\n\nCassidy, who is up for reelection and facing a primary, told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m a big \u2018back-the-blue\u2019 guy. I think people who assault police officers \u2014 if they do the crime, they should do the time.\u201d\n\nMurkowski said she\u2019s concerned about the message the pardons send to the US Capitol Police officers who protect the lawmakers every day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the approach of a blanket pardon that includes those who caused harm, physical harm, to our police officers, to others that resulted in violence, I\u2019m disappointed to see that,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cAnd I do fear the message that is sent to these great men and women that stood by us.\u201d\n\nWhen asked Tuesday whether he believed it was never acceptable to assault a police officer, Trump replied, \u201cSure.\u201d Pressed on a specific case of an individual who drove a stun gun into the neck of a police officer but who received a pardon, Trump said he didn\u2019t know but would \u201ctake a look at everything.\u201d\n\nAsked once more whether the pardons were sending a message that assaulting officers is OK, Trump said, \u201cNo, the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the friend of police more than any president that\u2019s ever been in this office,\u201d he said.\n\nShortly before taking office, Vice President JD Vance said those who committed violence that day \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned.\n\nAsked Tuesday why Vance\u2019s assertion was wrong, Trump said, \u201cWell, only for one reason: They\u2019ve served years in jail. They should not have served \u2014 excuse me \u2014 and they\u2019ve served years in jail. \u2026 These were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate.\u201d\n\nMost Republicans wouldn\u2019t weigh in on whether Trump had made the right decision. Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, argued it was the president\u2019s prerogative, not Congress\u2019, to issue pardons, a sentiment echoed by several others, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place. It\u2019s the president\u2019s sole decision, and he made a decision so I stand with him on it,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told reporters Tuesday night after previously declining to comment.\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said, \u201cI think obviously the pardon authority has really been opened up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden obviously with his preemptive pardons has opened it up even more, so the president has that authority. That sort of is my opinion on it,\u201d she added.\n\nBiden on Monday issued an extraordinary slate of preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump and for members of his own family, using executive prerogative as a shield against revenge by his incoming successor.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, another Republican from South Dakota, argued Trump \u201chas the constitutional ability to make those, and so it\u2019s up to him to do that. It\u2019s not up to us, and it\u2019s up to him to explain them.\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who has broken with Trump in the past, said it had overall been \u201ca terrible week for our justice system,\u201d arguing Biden had gone too far in his final hours as president with pardons as well.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me the press ought to be paying attention to this as well: preemptively granting pardons to five more members of his family, and we had the incoming president pardoning people who committed violent crimes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also have the outgoing president granting a pardon to an individual who killed two FBI agents.\u201d (In addition to members of his family, Biden issued a commutation to Leonard Peltier, an Indigenous activist who was convicted in the killing of two FBI agents in 1975.)\n\nAsked repeatedly by CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Tuesday about the pardons for individuals who attacked officers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin largely redirected to discussing Biden\u2019s pardons, even as he agreed that January 6 was \u201cno question\u201d a \u201criot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have my personal feelings on it, but the American people have chosen to move on, and President Trump, it\u2019s his prerogative to do this. \u2026 I get what you\u2019re saying about the violent crime; however, that is still the president\u2019s prerogative, just like it was Joe Biden\u2019s prerogative,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican said on \u201cOutFront.\u201d\n\nSen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana and former chairman of the Senate\u2019s campaign arm, would only say, \u201cI\u2019m grateful President Trump is the president of the United States\u201d when asked for his reaction to the pardons.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer and Ali Main contributed to this report.",

In early January, confirmation came that he had finally secured an appointment.\n\nBut a day before the appointment, a stroke of President Donald Trump\u2019s pen shut down the US immigration processing app known as CBP One \u2013 and with it, Cabrera\u2019s hopes.\n\n\u201cSo much time waiting, and now this surprise,\u201d Cabrera said with a voice of defeat. \u201cThey shut off our dreams.\u201d\n\nUntil Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, migrants seeking asylum from violence or persecution had the option to schedule an appointment at a legal US port of entry to make their case.\n\n\u201cWe are left adrift, we have no resources left, we arrived in Juarez with money to pay for one night in a hotel,\u201d the native Venezuelan said.\n\nCabrera is one of several migrants CNN spoke to who recently arrived in Ciudad Juarez after weeks of travel for their CBP One appointments, only to find the sessions they had been given were canceled.\n\nNow, many are stranded with no money or any sense of what to do next.\n\nIt was just below freezing in Ciudad Juarez on Monday when Cabrera realized what had happened, but he and his family decided to still try to explain the situation to US immigration authorities at the Paso del Norte bridge, which connects the Mexican city with the Texas city of El Paso.\n\n\u201cI had a thread of hope,\u201d Cabrera told CNN, fighting the cold in a leather jacket and with a winter mask covering most of his face.\n\nBut they were quickly turned away. Cabrera and his family were instead directed to a local Mexican public agency for further guidance. There, they were given some warm soup, but got little information on how to pursue their case.\n\n\u2018We did everything legally\u2019\n\nErlianny Colombie, 41, left Cuba seven months ago and had been living in the southern Mexico town of Tapachula along with three relatives.\n\nAfter finding a place to work and live in Tapachula, he applied for an appointment with US officials.\n\n\u201cWe got lucky, we got an appointment,\u201d Colombie told CNN. \u201cSo, we bought bus tickets, we obtained permission to move through Mexico, a lot of sacrifice, we did everything legally.\u201d\n\nBut the travel and costs of obtaining paperwork stretched his resources to breaking point. \u201cWe had enough money for the night before our appointment (\u2026) and now we are on the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nColombie \u2013 who says he fled Cuba due to political persecution \u2013 says he \u201cunderstands\u201d Trump\u2019s decision but asks the president to reconsider for those who already had an appointment.\n\nErlianny Colombie from Cuba, holds his CBP One appointment confirmation for Tuesday, January 21.

                "title": "Stargate: Trump announces a $500 billion AI infrastructure investment in the US",
                "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThree top tech firms on Tuesday announced that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison appeared at the White House Tuesday afternoon alongside President Donald Trump to announce the company, which Trump called the \u201clargest AI infrastructure project in history.\u201d\n\nThe companies will invest $100 billion in the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. The project is expected to create 100,000 US jobs, Trump said.\n\nStargate will build \u201cthe physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI,\u201d including data centers around the country, Trump said. Ellison said the group\u2019s first, 1 million-square foot data project is already under construction in Texas.\n\nAI leaders have for months been sounding the alarm that more data centers \u2014 as well as the chips and electricity and water resources to run them \u2014 are needed to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years.\n\n\u201cI think this will be the most important project of this era,\u201d Altman said on Tuesday. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nOracle is among the biggest US data center operators. And SoftBank has the kind of deep pockets needed to fund the expansion of AI infrastructure, which is expected to cost billions of dollars.\n\nAltman has previously urged US officials to aid in that infrastructure buildout to ensure the United States remains ahead of China in the AI arms race, given that AI is poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities. The OpenAI CEO also reportedly met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips.\n\nAltman, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, told Fox News last month that he believes Trump will \u201cbe very good at\u201d attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and said he looks \u201cforward to working with his administration on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure in the United States is super important, AI is a little bit different from other kinds of software in that it requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities,\u201d Altman said in the interview.\n\nIn a policy white paper published last week, OpenAI said investment in US AI infrastructure can ensure that US AI tools win out over Chinese technology, as well as creating new US jobs and economic opportunities, and urged the US government to create \u201cfoundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI.\u201d The brief estimated that there are \u201c$175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the US doesnt attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects\u2014strengthening the Chinese Communist Partys global influence,\u201d the company said.\n\nOracle said in a statement that the Stargate project \u201cwill secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world. This project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.\u201d\n\nSoftBank will have financial responsibility for Stargate and OpenAI will have operational responsibility. A fourth partner, MGX, is also contributing funding. SoftBank\u2019s Son will be Stargate\u2019s chairman, OpenAI said.\n\nNew presidents and presidents-elect have often held joint announcements with companies about massive US investments to promote a supposed rebirth of American industry. But their track record for success is decidedly mixed.\n\nTrump in 2017 announced with Foxconn a massive $10 billion electronics factory in Wisconsin that was expected to create 13,000 jobs. But the company eventually abandoned most of its plans for the facility and the high-tech products it was set to build. The company in 2021 said it would invest just $672 million in a revised deal that would create fewer than 1,500 jobs.\n\nFoxconn has said it invested $1 billion into the state, however, and it still has a major manufacturing site for data servers with more than 1,000 employees. But the facility Trump announced has become a Microsoft data hub that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump on Monday also reversed an executive order passed by former President Joe Biden in 2023 that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nIt\u2019s a key example of how enforcement is going to be different under the new Trump administration from the Biden administration.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement set a policy in 2011 preventing agents from making arrests in sensitive locations. The Biden administration put out similar guidance. Immigrant advocates have shared concerns over stripping that policy, arguing that doing so would stoke fear in immigrant communities and keep children from going to school or people from seeking care at hospitals.\n\nThe second directive includes the phaseout of parole programs that allowed certain migrants to temporarily live and work in the United States. Republicans have repeatedly said the Biden administration abused the parole program by extending it to multiple nationalities. The statement doesn\u2019t clarify which programs will be phased out, but says the program will be returned to a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration abused the humanitarian parole program to indiscriminately allow 1.5 million migrants to enter our country. This was all stopped on day one of the Trump Administration. This action will return the humanitarian parole program to its original purpose of looking at migrants on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the statement says.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump will flex one of the most intense and sweeping demonstrations of presidential power on the first day of any administration, seeking to fundamentally change America\u2019s course by sundown on Monday.\n\nOn a frigid day that forced inside his swearing-in as the 47th president, Trump plans a blizzard of hardline executive actions on immigration, energy production, transgender athletes and the pardoning of January 6 rioters.\n\nHis inaugural show of force \u2014 \u201cclose to 100 to be exact,\u201d he said Sunday \u2014 will set the tone for a second term anchored on Trump\u2019s strongman persona and vision of an all-powerful presidency, aimed at unleashing intense disruption at home and abroad.\n\nBut before he took office, outgoing President Joe Biden made his own extraordinary use of executive power that reflected an uncertain national moment, granting preemptive pardons to public servants deemed potential targets of Trump\u2019s vows to seek retribution against his adversaries.\n\nThe list includes former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, the nation\u2019s former top infectious diseases specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci, and members of Congress and staff who served on the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe pardons, which Biden stressed did not denote wrongdoing, also extended to police officers who testified before the panel.\n\nTrump warmed up for his second inauguration at a Sunday victory rally in Washington, DC, that culminated in a spectacle that would have astounded generations of his starchy collared predecessors, showing off his lock-kneed, jerky dad dance with the Village People and their late 1970s hit \u201cYMCA\u201d \u2014 his political anthem.\n\nHis informality underscored how the former real estate magnate, tabloid villain and reality TV star has become a cultural figure among his millions of admirers.\n\nTrump speaks at a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, on Sunday. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nThat MAGA mystique is also rooted in his resilience \u2014 after surviving two assassination attempts, a pair of impeachments, four criminal indictments and one conviction. His return to power, using the same democratic process he tried to crush to avoid leaving office after the 2020 election, means his comeback is among the most stunning second acts in American history. It\u2019s also a dark omen of how an imperialist president might try to use his new power.\n\nTrump is no longer a populist, nationalist aberration in a long line of post-World War II presidents who all operated with similar assumptions about American\u2019s role in the world. His victory in November, making him only the second president to win nonconsecutive terms, means that he is a historically significant figure \u2014 whatever happens over the next four years.\n\nAnd Trump scored two big wins even before he took office. First, three hostages were released Sunday to Israel by Hamas as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal being credited to his imminent arrival in office. Then, Trump, at least for now, saved TikTok, which briefly shut down to comply with a federal ban imposed over fears the social media site could be manipulated by China.\n\nEach breakthrough demonstrated Trump\u2019s flair for the statesmanship of a showman and his preference for the personal and improvisational use of presidential power. Since winning the November election, he has changed domestic and global political dynamics after months of an aging Biden fading from the scene.\n\nBut in the cases of TikTok and the Middle East, Trump\u2019s initial \u201cwins\u201d Sunday will soon cede to far more complex negotiations and decisions that will call for intense presidential engagement and far-sighted strategic wisdom that he didn\u2019t always supply in his first term.\n\nTrump is already looking far beyond the tasks voters assigned him\n\nTrump won last year\u2019s election \u2014 only four years after he was turned out of office for failing to revive a disgruntled, pandemic-hit nation \u2014 because a plurality of voters was weary of high prices and a border crisis that Biden had denied, and they lost faith in the government\u2019s capacity to help them.\n\nSo, an impatient electorate might not give Trump much time. And the success or failure of his second term could hinge on his capacity to do the basics \u2014 such as reduce the price of staples like eggs and milk, which he has already admitted will be tough to do.\n\nBut on Sunday, at his jubilant rally, Trump also raised expectations of transformational change in multiple areas. The history of the presidency, the evidence of his first-term chaos, and his narrow congressional majorities, however, suggest such change will be very hard to achieve.\n\n\u201cEveryone in our country will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe stand on the verge of the four greatest years in America.\u201d\n\nPeople vote in the presidential election in Milwaukee on November 5, 2024. Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nMuch of Trump\u2019s appeal lies in his belligerence and outsider authenticity.\n\nBut the truth about his second term will be revealed only by looking beyond stunts and hyperbole to judge the depth and sustainability of his actions. His voters might love his aggression. And Trump has built a new coalition with more young voters, minorities and working-class Americans than before. But his behavior alienates the other half of the country. And the promise of inaugural eve will soon be swamped by the ugly realities of government, which are almost certain to split the Republican Party.\n\nExpected \u201cshock and awe\u201d deportation raids and showdowns in Democratic-run cities are intended to make a political point, honor campaign promises and deter more migration. But they could also create a climate of fear that rebounds against Trump and Republicans politically and threatens the civil rights of American citizens and immigrants.\n\nStill, the president-elect, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term, is leaving no doubt he aims to launch at a similar speed to one of the SpaceX rockets owned by Elon Musk, who came onstage Sunday to vow \u201csignificant change.\u201d\n\n\u201cStarting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country,\u201d Trump pledged at the euphoric victory party in Washington\u2019s Capital One Arena.\n\nA stunning comeback for a cultural icon\n\nFour years ago, a chastened Trump bolted from Washington before Biden\u2019s inauguration for a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews. He was still in disgrace two weeks after the assault on the US Capitol by supporters fired up by election lies, and he signed off with: \u201cHave a good life. We will see you soon.\u201d\n\nOn that morning in 2021, no one could have imagined Trump\u2019s stunning political resurrection, highlighted Sunday by a tour-de-force speech on a vast red stage before thousands of MAGA devotees.\n\n\u201cWe won,\u201d Trump said at his first rally in Washington since January 6, 2021, underscoring how sufficient voters were so desperate for a shake-up of government that they were ready to move on from his behavior after the 2020 election.\n\nIn this January 20, 2021 photo, Donald Trump and Melania Trump board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Pete Marovich/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe speech \u2014 a classic of his \u201cweave\u201d genre of rhetoric \u2014 blended demagoguery and comedy, searing anti-migrant rhetoric, warnings of impending world war, twisted facts, brashness and showmanship. He mixed in promises to end the war in Ukraine with riffs about claiming the spotlight at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the US and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. His disdain for presidential decorum showed exactly why millions of Americans believe that he is their authentic voice.\n\n\u201cWe are all going to be sworn in tomorrow, that\u2019s the way I look at it,\u201d Trump told his admirers.\n\nTrump will benefit from the legitimacy conferred by his predecessor attending his inauguration \u2014 a privilege he denied to Biden. And unlike Trump in 2020, Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her defeat in a democratic election.\n\nFurthermore, the authoritarian streak revealed in Trump four years ago is why so many Americans are horrified by his return.\n\nThe rest of the world is also on edge: Trump has already sparked political crises from Canada to Panama to Denmark with expansionist rhetoric during the transition. Allies are nervous. But Trump can hardly wait for summits with tyrants he most admires, Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\n\u2018Days of Thunder\u2019 lie ahead\n\nThe scope of Trump\u2019s ambition is vast.\n\n\u201cBy the time the sun sets tomorrow evening, the invasion of our borders will have come to a halt, and all the illegal border trespasses will, in some form or another, be on their way back home,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\nAides revealed he\u2019d sign some executive actions shortly after being sworn in and then more at Capital One Arena, the indoor venue for his inauguration parade.\n\nHe pledged to \u201cdefeat inflation\u201d and provide the lowest-cost energy on Earth, cut taxes, slash prices, raise wages and return thousands of factories to the US with the use of tariffs. Trump said he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine, stop \u201cchaos\u201d in the Middle East, prevent World War III, crush violent crime in cities, and rebuild the police and the military. He said he\u2019d rebuild Los Angeles, where he plans to visit Friday, after its wildfires and make it more \u201cbeautiful\u201d than before.\n\nA Trump supporter takes photos outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Rebecca Wright/CNN\n\nEven accomplishing a few of these goals would mark Trump\u2019s second term as a miraculous success by modern standards. But he has to do all this as a lame duck, hampered by a minuscule GOP majority in the House of Representatives and the constant threat of a Democratic rebound in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe president-elect does, however, have the advantage of doing the job once before \u2014 and having a clear sense of where he wants to go.\n\nTrump allowed himself a rare moment of introspection during his rally, touching on his place in history \u2014 and the potential for his second term to leave a more robust and widely accepted legacy than his first.\n\n\u201cSomeday, in 30 years from now, 40 years from now, 50 years from now, some of these young people are going to say, \u2018I remember Donald Trump. He did a good job. He sent us on (our way). He gave us a path,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBut before then, there will be what Trump\u2019s first-term political guru Steve Bannon has called \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d\n\nAmerica and the world better be ready.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

                "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping vowed to take his country\u2019s ties with Russia to a new level this year in a video conference with counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, hours after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe two leaders have made it an annual tradition to speak around the new year \u2013 a feature of a close personal rapport that\u2019s helped cement a partnership between their countries that\u2019s only grown as Putin wages war on Ukraine.\n\nXi expressed his readiness to \u201cguide China-Russia relations to a new height\u201d and respond to \u201cexternal uncertainties\u201d with the \u201cstability and resilience of China-Russia ties,\u201d a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe two countries should deepen \u201cstrategic coordination\u201d and \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d and \u201cfirmly support each other,\u201d Xi told the Russian president, who appeared via video link on a large screen in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People during the conference call.\n\nPutin hailed the countries\u2019 expanding trade \u2013 which Chinese data show hit a record high last year \u2013 and alluded to their shared ambitions to reshape a global order they see as unfairly dominated by the United States.\n\n\u201cWe stand united in advocating for a more just multipolar world order and work to ensure indivisible security both in the Eurasian space and globally,\u201d Putin told Xi, according to a Kremlin readout. Moscow and Beijing\u2019s joint efforts \u201cobjectively play a major stabilizing role in international affairs,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThe call between the two autocrats comes as both closely watch Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nThe two leaders have each publicly expressed a hope to reset fraught relations with the US under the new administration. Trump has also signaled interest in engaging with or meeting both leaders early in his presidency, though it\u2019s still unclear how conciliatory or hardline the new administration will be toward either US rival.\n\nXi and Trump held their own call days before the US president\u2019s inauguration, with the conversation touching on a range of topics including the war in Ukraine, Trump later said.\n\nXi told Putin about that phone call during the two leaders\u2019 more than hour-and-a-half conversation Tuesday, according to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, who added that the timing of the call was unrelated to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cIssues of the two countries\u2019 relations with the United States were also raised,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, the leaders, naturally, discussed certain aspects of the development of potential contacts with the US administration,\u201d Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping via video link from a state residence outside Moscow on January 21, 2025. Gavriil Grigorov/pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA diplomatic triangle?\n\nTrump has voiced personal admiration for both autocrats, but he\u2019s also expected to seek concessions from each with an eye to evening an economic playing field between the US and China and ending Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine.\n\nTrump on Tuesday indicated he would consider placing additional sanctions on Russia if Putin failed to come to the negotiating table to end the war.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking to (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky. We\u2019re going to be talking with President Putin very soon, and we\u2019ll see what \u2013 how it all happens,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also suggested he hopes Xi can use his sway to play a role in brokering an end to that conflict, noting that he urged the Chinese leader during their recent call to \u201cget it settled.\u201d\n\nEuropean leaders have long hoped that Xi could play a role bringing Putin around to accepting Ukraine\u2019s peace terms, but the entrance of Trump into the White House and his stated drive to end the war adds new potential for China to play a role.\n\nThat could set up a delicate balancing act for Beijing. Xi has long sought to portray China as a potential peace broker in the conflict, even as the US and its allies have accused Beijing of propping up the Russian war effort with the export of dual-use goods, which Beijing denies. Xi is also seen to be keen to build good rapport with Trump to avert potentially damaging tariffs at a time of economic weakness in China.\n\nBut the Chinese leader will also likely want to be careful not to damage his partnership with Russia. Xi and Putin inked a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership weeks before Putin\u2019s invasion and Xi sees his Russian counterpart as a critical partner among broader frictions with the West.\n\nNeither the readout from the Kremlin nor China\u2019s Foreign Ministry specified whether the war in Ukraine was discussed during Tuesday\u2019s call between Putin and Xi.\n\nInstead, both readouts referred to the 80th anniversary of the allied victory shared by Beijing and Moscow in World War II. Xi and Putin had each invited the other to commemorate that victory together this year, with events in Russia in May and China in September, the Kremlin said Tuesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Fred He contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nHis inauguration speech was loudest in its silence on Ukraine. But hours later, US President Donald Trump laid bare \u2013 in a trademark casual, rambling fashion \u2013 his position over the war in Ukraine. And it was tougher on the Kremlin than you might expect.\n\nTalking to reporters in the White House, he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin: \u201cHe should make a deal. I think he\u2019s destroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d\n\nTrump was unprecedentedly stark, focusing on the economic damage done to Russia by the war. \u201cI think Russia is going to be in big trouble. You take a look at their economy. You take a look at their inflation in Russia,\u201d he added, referring to price rises edging towards 10%. \u201cI got along with him great. I would hope he wants to make a deal.\u201d\n\nHe loosely referenced Moscow\u2019s staggering casualty rates in a war now nearing its fourth year in which Western officials estimate 700,000 Russians have been killed or injured.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be thrilled,\u201d Trump said of Putin. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing so well. I mean, he\u2019s grinding it out\u2026 it\u2019s not making him look very good\u2026 I think he would be well off to end that war.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would meet with Putin, and the details were being arranged. \u201cCould be very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war Ukraine and Russia should have never started,\u201d he added. Reminded he had promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being in office, he joked: \u201cI have another half day left. We\u2019ll see. We want to get it done.\u201d\n\nTrump said Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he wants to make a deal \u2013 an echo of recent comments from Kyiv they were open to diplomacy, provided it created a sustainable end to the war that is palatable to Ukraine. \u201cZelensky wants to make a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Putin does. He might not. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nZelensky welcomed Trump\u2019s inauguration, saying he was a \u201cstrong man,\u201d adding: \u201cUkrainians are ready to work together with Americans to achieve peace, real peace. This is a chance that must be seized.\u201d\n\nThe comments constitute some of the most critical Trump has made of the Kremlin head. His focus on economic mismanagement and the Kremlin\u2019s tolerance of horrific casualty rates, suggest his White House is aware Russia may be under some time pressure and intend to exploit it.\n\nPreviously, throughout their campaign for the White House, both Trump and Vice President JD Vance had expressed skepticism of continued American involvement in Ukraine\u2019s fight, often suggesting that Ukraine ought to settle for a truce with Russia despite the loss of its territory.\n\nThe president\u2019s assertion he wants to meet Putin suggests Trump thinks his interpersonal \u201cart of the deal\u201d may forge a diplomatic path.\n\nComfortingly also for Kyiv, his reference to aid for Ukraine leant on the need for European NATO members to pay more, rather than for US assistance to stop. Trump began his exchange with reporters by criticizing NATO\u2019s European members, saying they needed to pay 5% of their GDP in defense \u2013 almost double for many.\n\nTrump said the United States was funding Ukraine\u2019s assistance to the tune of $200 billion more than Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean between.\u201d",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for consistency, you\u2019ve come to the wrong country.\n\nIt\u2019s a new era of American whiplash as the country settles into a multi-year cycle of presidents correcting each other.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s first day in office set the stage for an effort to undo whatever Joe Biden and his administration did. Trump\u2019s most shocking actions were his mass pardon of people who were charged in the January 6, 2021, attack of the US Capitol and his challenge to birthright citizenship, which is in the Constitution. The latter is already the subject of a lawsuit from Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nBut much of what Trump did was specifically aimed at turning Biden\u2019s four years into the interregnum between two Trump terms, undoing Biden immigration policies, ending government diversity programs and climate change efforts and taking more political control of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions are the mirror image of four years ago, when Biden came into office and signed executive orders to undo multiple Trump immigration policies, restore protections for government workers, expand diversity and inclusion programs in the government and reverse Trump environmental policies.\n\nWhat one president does, the next is looking to undo.\n\nDenali. McKinley. Denali. McKinley.\n\nWhether the nation\u2019s highest peak should have the traditional Alaskan name Denali, meaning \u201cGreat One,\u201d or be known as Mt. McKinley to honor a Republican president from Ohio who was assassinated at the turn of the 20th century, is a Rorschach test for the moment.\n\nPresident Barack Obama renamed it Denali. President Donald Trump, ignoring Alaska Republicans, is renaming it Mt. McKinley.\n\nBut naming a mountain seems small compared to some other zigging and zagging by the government in recent years.\n\nParis climate agreement: in and out and in and out\n\n\u25ba Obama joined the Paris climate agreement in 2016.\n\n\u25ba Trump pulled the US out in 2017.\n\n\u25ba Biden rejoined in 2021.\n\n\u25ba Now Trump is pulling the US out again, arguing the US should not have to do so much to address the world\u2019s changing climate.\n\nThe trend extends further back, since President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration agreed to join the international Kyoto Protocol \u2013 which predated the Paris agreement \u2013 but President George W. Bush\u2019s administration pulled the US out.\n\nWorld Health Organization: Restarting the departure again\n\n\u25ba President Harry Truman joined the World Health Organization in 1948. \u201cWe must and will give freely of our great knowledge to help liberate men everywhere from the overhanging dread of preventable disease,\u201d Truman said at the time.\n\n\u25ba Trump began the process of pulling the US out of the WHO in 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, complaining the US was contributing too much money compared to China.\n\n\u25ba Biden restored the US to the WHO on his first day in office in 2021.\n\n\u25ba Trump restarted the process of pulling the US on his first day in office in 2025.\n\nRe-reclassifying federal workers again\n\nComplaining of a \u201cdeep state\u201d bent against him, Trump tried in 2020 to reclassify some federal workers who have a role in policy making as \u201cSchedule F\u201d to make it easier to fire them.\n\nBiden stopped the process in 2021 and went a step further, signing an order with new protections for federal workers.\n\nTrump is moving to revive Schedule F and has said the bureaucracy must be more responsive to his will. \u201cAny power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nCNN\u2019s report notes that critics fear Trump\u2019s effort to instill a federal workforce more loyal to him will undermine the merit-based professional civil service created to replace a corrupt spoils system just before McKinley\u2019s time as president.\n\nTo drill or not to drill\n\nTrump 1.0 tried to undo Obama\u2019s ban on oil drilling in arctic waters.\n\nTrump 2.0 will now try undo Biden\u2019s ban on offshore oil drilling. It\u2019s not clear how much additional oil drilling Trump\u2019s action would create since the US is already producing more oil than any other country.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump is halting Biden\u2019s efforts to end land and water leasing for wind energy.\n\nAnd on the automobile front, Obama tried to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, including by publishing rules to limit tailpipe emissions.\n\nTrump rolled them back again in 2020. Biden took another shot at tailpipe emissions and pushing for electric and hybrid vehicles. Trump plans to roll those back too, although the car market is already moving toward EVs, with or without the US government.\n\nOn some issues, Trump is ready to correct himself\n\nDuring his first administration Trump made a very big deal of renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which was put in place by President Bill Clinton.\n\nTrump negotiated the replacement US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, one of the successes of his first term. In the early days of his second term, however, Trump is threatening Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs to kick in on February 1. Those import taxes would seem to jeopardize his own treaty and make things more expensive for Americans, but does set up the prospect of new concessions from Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe real news on tariffs may be that Trump has delayed, for the moment, talk of broad new tariffs on all imports and specifically on Chinese goods.\n\nBiden, for the record, maintained Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on China \u2013 proof that not everything one president does will be undone by the next.",

                "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nFor many of America\u2019s 170 million TikTok users, US President Donald Trump\u2019s move to delay a legal ban of the popular social media platform was cause for celebration.\n\nBut in China, where TikTok\u2019s parent company is based, the reception has been less positive, largely because Trump has suggested he could require the company to give up a 50% stake to avert a shutdown and suggested tariffs on Chinese goods could hinge on whether Beijing approves a potential future deal.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s vision for the future of TikTok, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the \u201coperation and acquisition of companies\u201d should be \u201cdecided by companies\u201d and in line with Chinese law.\n\nThe US should \u201cearnestly listen to the voice of reason\u201d and \u201cprovide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment\u201d for companies from all countries, spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Tuesday.\n\nHours after his inauguration Monday, Trump issued an executive order delaying for 75 days the enforcement of a controversial law, which requires that TikTok be banned in the US unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies.\n\nThe executive action followed a pledge from Trump on Sunday that he would delay enforcement. TikTok said that assurance allowed it to come back online after going dark for more than 12 hours over the weekend.\n\nThe delay will help the Trump administration \u201cdetermine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown of a communications platform used by millions of Americans,\u201d the order said.\n\nTrump in recent days has repeatedly suggested that he could be open to an American buyer purchasing half of the company and running it as a 50-50 joint venture with its current Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\nA joint venture involving a US firm with a 50% stake in TikTok would soften the letter of the controversial law, though it\u2019s unclear whether US lawmakers or TikTok, which denies that it poses a national security risk to Americans, would accept it.\n\nBacklash in China\n\nOn Chinese social media, where TikTok\u2019s fate has appeared as one among many efforts from the US to stymie Beijing\u2019s technical prowess, Trump\u2019s suggestions were met with disdain.\n\nTens of millions of users on the social media platform Weibo flocked to hashtags related to the potential 50-50 ownership, with many decrying the US government\u2019s \u201crobbery.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple and Tesla should also give up 50% of their shares to Chinese companies then,\u201d one comment with thousands of likes said.\n\n\u201cWe need 50% control of Nvidia then!\u201d said another commentator, referring to the US chipmaker.\n\n\u201cChina will not let ByteDance kneel down,\u201d another comment read, referring to TikTok\u2019s parent company. \u201cRobbery does not change its nature just because it changes from 100% to 50%,\u201d the comment added.\n\nMedia giant ByteDance does not operate TikTok in China, but its sister app Douyin is popular domestically.\n\nMeanwhile, an editorial in the state-run nationalist tabloid Global Times on Tuesday looked at the handling of the US ban and concluded that \u201cthe trap some Americans set for TikTok has ensnared them instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe political manipulation of an overstretched concept of security against TikTok has not only caused fluctuations in the emotions of the American public, but has also led to \u2018deep personal pain\u2019 for some who rely on it for their livelihood,\u201d the editorial read.\n\nTikTok and tariffs\n\nDespite the uncertainty around the fate of TikTok, both the US and China have appeared to show their interest in dialogue as the new administration gets underway.\n\nIn a phone call with Trump on Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a \u201cnew starting point\u201d in US-China relations and stressed their \u201cextensive common interests.\u201d Trump noted that the call included discussion of TikTok.\n\nXi also dispatched Chinese Vice President Han Zheng to Trump\u2019s inauguration, the seniormost official Beijing has ever sent to an American presidential inauguration.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order on TikTok stands as one of a range of signals from the newly sworn-in president that he is willing to negotiate with Beijing, despite campaigning on a hardline stance on the country, the US\u2019s key geopolitical rival.\n\nTrump on Monday also refrained from slapping tariffs on Chinese goods, something observers suggested could be on his day one agenda. While on the campaign trial, Trump threatened upwards of 60% tariffs on Chinese imports into the US, and Beijing has been bracing for sharper economic competition with the US.\n\nWhen asked about those tariffs Monday, Trump said duties he imposed as president the first time around were still in place. He did not name any timeline within which he might levy more duties, despite saying tariffs against Mexican and Canadian goods could go into place February 1.\n\nBut Trump also suggested tariffs could be linked to TikTok\u2019s fate, raising questions about the kind of hard bargaining the president may have in mind in the months ahead.\n\nIn remarks in the Oval Office Monday, Trump posited levying as much as 100% tariffs on China if Beijing didn\u2019t approve a potential future agreement.\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to make a deal with TikTok and it was a good deal and China wouldn\u2019t approve it \u2026 I think ultimately, they\u2019d approve it because we\u2019d put tariffs on China, maybe,\u201d he said, while suggesting this wasn\u2019t the only approach he could take.\n\nBeijing has previously suggested it has the legal authority to block any deal involving TikTok, saying such a sale or divestiture would involve \u201cexporting technology\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to the potential sale of the app\u2019s proprietary algorithm.\n\nTrump ally and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also joined the fray discussing the future of TikTok by alluding to the \u201cneed for change\u201d in comments Sunday on X, the social media platform he owns. According to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, Chinese officials are discussing a possible option that involves selling at least a portion of the US version of the app to Musk\u2019s X.\n\nMusk pointed out how X is not available in China. Most major American-owned tech platforms are blocked in the country due to Beijing\u2019s stringent controls on speech and information under the so-called Great Firewall.\n\n\u201cI have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cThat said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.\u201d",

                "title": "Gaza after 15 months of war: A snapshot in maps and charts",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect on Sunday, with the first six-weeks of the deal ushering in a pause to fighting, the staggered release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and an influx of aid to Gaza. The three-phase ceasefire has raised cautious hopes for an end to the war.\n\nIsraeli bombardment of Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has caused a devastating impact on the territory, with aid agencies warning that damage to critical infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, water and health care facilities, will take years to rebuild.\n\nHere\u2019s a look \u2013 in 6 charts \u2013 at what Gaza is like after 15 months of war.\n\nAn additional 11,000 people remain unaccounted for \u2013 likely either missing or not yet found under rubble, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n\nHowever recent research suggests that the death toll could be far higher than current estimates. A London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) study that was also published in The Lancet journal this month found that the Palestinian health ministry has underreported the death toll by approximately 41%. As of October 2024, the number of Gazans killed by violence was thought to exceed 70,000, according to the study.\n\nMeanwhile, the health ministry said in October that one third of those killed in the first year of the war were children.\n\nIsraeli military strikes have razed most of Gaza to rubble, with Gaza City the most heavily destroyed. Around 436,000 housing units have been destroyed or damaged across the strip, according to the United Nations.\n\nAround 1.9 million Palestinians \u2013 or about 90% of the population \u2013 are internally displaced, according to the UN. Many people in Gaza have been displaced multiple times \u2013 some up to 10 times.\n\nThe Israeli military regularly ordered evacuations from one area of danger to another, according to the UN, who have repeatedly said there \u201cis no safe place in Gaza.\u201d Evacuation orders were issued across 67% of Gaza throughout the course of the war, according to data from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nThose orders were often airdropped by the Israeli military \u2013 a method Amnesty International said was \u201cnot an effective warning to civilians\u201d \u2013 or posted to social media \u2013 an inaccessible form of communication for many Gazans without power or internet.\n\nThe Israeli military has said that it does all it can to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza, including by sending text messages, making phone calls, and dropping evacuation leaflets to warn civilians ahead of attacks.\n\nAl-Mawasi, a 67 square kilometer (25.9 square miles) area \u2013 roughly the size of Manhattan, has become the main displacement and refuge area for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ordered by the Israeli military to leave their homes. Before the war, there were 9,000 people living there. By July 2024, the population of the camp had swelled to 1.7 million, according to the UN-backed Famine Early Warning Systems Network. In October, the camp\u2019s population was estimated to be 730,000, according to UNICEF.\n\nDespite being designated as a humanitarian zone by Israel, Al-Mawasi has been targeted repeatedly by Israeli airstrikes.\n\nMany people in Gaza have struggled to access food for over a year.\n\nPrior to the war, Gaza was \u201clargely self-sufficient\u201d in fresh produce, according to the UN. Israel\u2019s military operation has damaged or destroyed up to 96% of agricultural assets, including farms and orchards, according to the World Bank. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that it \u201cdoes not intentionally harm agricultural land and seeks to mitigate environmental impact absent operational necessity.\u201d\n\nMost of Gaza is reliant on humanitarian aid, but many aid entry points into Gaza have been closed by Israeli authorities throughout the war.\n\nThat includes the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 and once one of the largest and most important aid crossings into Gaza \u2013 which has been closed since May 2024, when Israel seized control of it. Other aid entry points have been open with extremely limited access.\n\nThe UN said in November that people are \u201ceffectively starving as the conflict rages, with humanitarian organizations blocked from delivering assistance to those in need.\u201d\n\nBefore the war, an average of 500 trucks a day \u2013 around 15,000 trucks a month \u2013 containing aid and commercial goods entered Gaza per month.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Tuesday that only 2,205 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the month of December, excluding commercial vehicles and fuel.\n\nIsrael disputed that number, saying there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza and that over 5,000 trucks had entered over the course of the month, according to a statement from the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which manages the flow of aid into the strip.\n\nMeanwhile, trucks that do enter Gaza are now facing additional challenges in moving across the territory: Approximately 68% of the road network has been damaged, according to satellite imagery analysis by UNOSAT.\n\nAnd criminal gangs continue to loot convoys carrying food.\n\nGaza\u2019s health care system is in ruins. Prior to October 2023, there were 36 operational hospitals in Gaza. Now, not a single hospital in Gaza is fully functional.\n\nIsrael\u2019s pattern of attacks has \u201cpushed the health care system to the brink of total collapse,\u201d according to a December UN report. To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 654 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza, resulting in 886 fatalities and 1,349 injuries.\n\nThe IDF has said that Hamas fighters embed inside hospitals and store arms in them.\n\nOnly half of Gaza\u2019s hospitals are partially operational, relying solely on aid and fuel deliveries to function.\n\nFuel shortages continue to threaten the care for around 2,000 patients, according to the WHO\u2019s health cluster, around 10% of whom are in intensive care units. Additionally, more than 12,000 patients are estimated to require urgent medical evacuation abroad.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Israeli military killed at least 10 Palestinians, including a child, in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday as its prime minister announced the start of a \u201clarge-scale military operation\u201d in the restive city of Jenin \u2013 just two days after the Gaza ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIsrael\u2019s security cabinet launched the military offensive \u2013 which involved the Israeli military, police and Shin Bet security agency \u2013 to \u201ceradicate terrorism in Jenin,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The operation is called \u201cIron Wall,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, Hamas issued a statement calling for \u201cpeople in the West Bank and its revolutionary youth to mobilize and escalate the clash with the occupation army at all points of contact with it.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian state news agency Wafa said Israeli warplanes struck Jenin and Israeli forces, including sharpshooters and armored vehicles, were surrounding the city\u2019s refugee camp and stopping ambulances from entering.\n\nVideos from local journalists showed a large number of armored vehicles, including bulldozers, entering Jenin. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 10 people \u2013 nine men and one teenage boy \u2013 were killed and 40 injured in the city.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether those killed were bystanders or engaged in hostilities with Israeli forces. Videos from the scene seem to show that at least two were civilians who appeared to be unarmed. Local residents told CNN that a man who was shot and later pronounced dead in a hospital in Jenin was a civilian.\n\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad\u2019s armed wing Al Quds Brigades said its fighters were firing at advancing Israeli troops around the refugee camp.\n\nIslamic Jihad said Israeli military operation is an attempt by Netanyahu to save his \u201cfaltering government coalition\u201d and spoil the \u201cjoy\u201d after Palestinian prisoners were released in the West Bank as part of the Gaza truce.\n\n\u201cWe call on our people throughout the occupied West Bank to confront this criminal campaign by all means, thwart its goals, and consolidate the enemy\u2019s defeat in subduing the will of our people in the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d the militant group said in a statement.\n\nThis latest offensive comes after the Israeli military carried out a major and deadly military operation in the northern West Bank in August and September. That campaign was called \u201cOperation Summer Camps.\u201d\n\nNew \u2018war goal\u2019\n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right nationalist who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, said in a statement Tuesday that security in the West Bank had been added to the country\u2019s \u201cwar goals.\u201d CNN has asked the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for confirmation of that claim.\n\n\u201cAfter Gaza and Lebanon, today, with God\u2019s help, we have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria and in the campaign to eradicate terrorism in the region,\u201d he said, using the biblical name by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.\n\nSmotrich had publicly toyed with quitting the Israeli government over the Gaza ceasefire, but decided to stay in the cabinet after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu on his commitment to continue Israel\u2019s military operations.\n\nThere has been a significant uptick in violence in the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, the outgoing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the military \u201cmust be ready for significant operations\u201d in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) in Ramallah said Monday that it was \u201calarmed\u201d by this new wave of violence by Israeli settlers and security forces in the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli security forces shot and killed a reportedly unarmed 14-year-old Palestinian boy on Sunday, the OHCHR said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe OHCHR said \u201cscores of settlers\u201d stormed several Palestinian towns on Sunday, torching houses and vehicles, blocking roads and throwing stones.\n\nThe attacks continued on Monday, residents of Al-Funduq, a town east of Qalqilya, told CNN. They said a large group of armed settlers set fire to vehicles and shops in the town, throwing stones and firing towards houses before moving to a nearby village where they burnt two tractors and a plantation nursery, as well as caused damage to a house.\n\nThe international community has long condemned settler violence which has increased in recent years and gone mostly unpunished.\n\nThe US, under the Biden administration, had imposed sanctions against several Israeli settlers allegedly responsible for deadly violence but those sanctions have now been rescinded, with the decision to do so among the slew of executive orders US President Donald Trump signed upon taking office on Monday. The following day, Trump\u2019s nominee to be US ambassador to the UN, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, said she agreed with the view espoused by a number of far-right politicians in Israel that Israel has \u201ca biblical right\u201d to annex the West Bank.\n\nJewish settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law and the United Nations\u2019 top court said in July that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was illegal.\n\nRegarding the latest bout of violence, the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem said that \u201csettlers, backed, escorted, and with full cooperation (of) the Israeli army,\u201d attacked Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on settler attacks in several parts of the territory.\n\nThe IDF said it and the police responded to reports of riots in Al-Funduq on Monday and two settlers were shot by the police during that response, according to a statement from the police.\n\nIsrael\u2019s emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said it treated two casualties, one in \u201ccritical condition\u201d and one in \u201cserious condition.\u201d Both patients had \u201cpenetrating injuries\u201d and were evacuated to the Meir hospital, according to the MDA.\n\nA joint statement from several Israeli commanders said on Tuesday that initial investigation indicated that \u201cdozens of Israeli civilians, some of whom were masked, arrived at the area of Al-Funduq, instigated riots, set property on fire, and caused damage.\u201d\n\nThe IDF\u2019s response to the settler attack in Al-Funduq sparked more violence on Tuesday. The police said 17 people were arrested and three police officers injured during a protest over the shooting of the settlers.\n\nIsraeli troops and settlers have killed at least 851 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack, including 173 children. Meanwhile, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008, according to the UN, which recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis \u2013 15 soldiers and 19 civilians. Of those civilians, seven were settlers.",

She won a historic bronze medal as a member of the US Women\u2019s Rugby Sevens squad, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s \u201cSwimsuit Edition,\u201d finished runner-up on \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d garnered new endorsements on her social media accounts, and signed a contract to play with England\u2019s Bristol Bears rugby team \u2014 which moved its matches to a bigger stadium to satisfy the surge in ticket demand upon her arrival.\n\nAll the while, she became the most followed rugby player on the planet with 8 million fans (and counting) across social media platforms.\n\nBecause for 28-year-old Maher, it isn\u2019t just about the accolades \u2014 it\u2019s about her message. With her signature sense of humor (and ever-present bold lipstick), she has spoken openly about body image, confidence and beauty \u201cstandards,\u201d breaking the traditional mold and inspiring millions of followers in the process.\n\nSo, how does it feel to have become America\u2019s sweetheart?\n\n\u201cI love when people call me that because I feel like I\u2019m maybe not the image you would have of a sweetheart in some sense of the word,\u201d Maher told CNN\u2019s Christina Macfarlane during a recent interview in Maher\u2019s hometown of Burlington, Vermont.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she adds, \u201cThis was kind of the trajectory I wanted it to take. I knew that in my sport, I wouldn\u2019t just get to play my sport and be happy with it. I knew that I had to do more to have a comfortable life for myself, to spread my game, to spread rugby in general. So for years now, I\u2019ve been leading up to this point, hoping to do what I\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m so happy that this worked out like it did.\u201d\n\nA highlight of Ilona Maher's whirlwind 2024 was posing for a digital cover of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit edition. For the US rugby star, it was a dream come true. \"When the call came, I was like, 'yeah, I want to do this thing.' I've always wanted to do it, and I was recently asked, 'Oh, how was it to be in a swimsuit all day? Was it scary? I was like, 'it was awesome.' I loved it,\" Maher tells CNN.

She made it to the finale of the reality dancing competition with her partner, Alan Bersten, as the pair ultimately finished runner-up. Competing on the show was \"very tough for me,\" Maher tells CNN. \"You're going out there to do something you're not good at in front of millions of people. But I'm so happy I did it.\" Eric McCandless/Disney/Getty Images The 2024 Olympics helped make Maher a star, capped with a first-ever medal for Team USA Women's Rugby Sevens as they defeated Australia in the bronze medal match in Paris, on July 30 (pictured). Three years earlier, it was the Tokyo Olympics that first elevated Maher's profile, and she says she's been posting videos on social media ever since.

Lloyd Bishop/NBC Maher, pictured here ahead of the 76th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in September 2024, says it\u2019s important to remind people \u201cI\u2019m so much more than just an athlete \u2026 (people) forget the personalities that (female athletes) have, how funny we are, the friendships, the way we are outside (our sport), the way we like to get dressed up.\u201d Stewart Cook/Disney/Getty Images Maher's 2024 ended with the announcement that she signed a contract to join the Bristol Bears rugby team in Bristol, England, part of the Premiership Women's Rugby league. Maher made her debut on the field against Gloucester-Hartpury on January 5, 2025 (pictured). \"My goal is to show how exciting women's rugby can be,\" Maher says. Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters In pictures: Ilona Maher's year for the ages Prev Next\n\n\u201cNever tone it down\u201d\n\nFirst and foremost, Maher is an athlete \u2014 one who is proud of her body, and what it can achieve, she says. But people often forget that athletes are more than what they see on the field.\n\n\u201cI think (people) put female athletes, especially, into a box, like that\u2019s all she is \u2014 \u2018She plays on the field and that\u2019s it.\u2019 They forget the personalities that we have, how funny we are, the friendships, the way we are outside, the way we like to get dressed up,\u201d Maher said.\n\n\u201cSo it was important for me to show many sides of me and the body positivity, body appreciation side kind of came naturally in a way because it is something that I feel strongly about. Also, with a lot of my content, I try to see what\u2019s relatable for others. And it\u2019s so interesting in my time of learning to appreciate my body, you kind of start to realize, \u2018Oh, everybody has insecurities.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaher credits her parents \u2014 including her father Michael, who has played rugby for more than 40 years \u2014 for getting her into sports and supporting a positive body image, even as she \u201cstruggled with that growing up.\u201d\n\nIlona Maher (left), with her sisters Adrianna and Olivia, in Lake Champlain, Vermont, around 2005. The Maher Family\n\nMaher (center) with family: mother Mieneke (left), sisters Olivia and Adrianna, and father Michael, at the Vancouver Sevens 2023. The Maher Family\n\nIlona Maher didn't start playing rugby until high school but quickly fell in love with the sport. Pictured: Maher after her first game for South Burlington High School Club Rugby in 2014. The Maher Family\n\n\u201cI have a body that a lot of people would say is not feminine or is not beautiful or is too strong, too this and that,\u201d she said. \u201cI never understood why my big body looked like this, yet I was always so fit and I was always so fast and I could always keep up. I didn\u2019t look like them, so I just love that people are seeing me.\u201d\n\nBut learning she should never apologize for who she is was a crucial lesson \u2014 and it came from her father. While playing fast-pitch softball as a young girl, Maher recalled, another father on the opposing team came up to her and said she needed to slow down \u2014 not one of the other players could hit her pitches.\n\nMaher\u2019s own dad was having none of it. He pulled out the rule book and said, \u201cThis is a fast-pitch league. She gets to throw fast pitches,\u201d Maher remembered.\n\n\u201cI think that was the first moment of being told to never tone it down,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause that dad over there \u2026 wanted me to tone myself down so that it could be easier for (his daughter). But that\u2019s not the world, is it? The world isn\u2019t going to tone down for you.\u201d\n\nImposter syndrome? Not for Maher\n\nSpend any time scrolling through comments under Maher\u2019s social media posts, and it won\u2019t take long to see her confidence is a trait so many of her fans admire.\n\nAnd what she doesn\u2019t have, she says, is imposter syndrome.\n\n\u201cI feel like I deserve what I\u2019ve got,\u201d Maher told CNN. \u201cI think I\u2019ve worked very hard, even in the rugby space \u2026 And then I do all the work off the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cI posted videos consistently from (the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) until now,\u201d she added. \u201cI put myself out there, I put my whole personality \u2014 my whole everything \u2014 out there. So maybe I have a little (imposter syndrome) sometimes \u2026 but it\u2019s OK to be proud of what you\u2019ve done, and it\u2019s OK to believe that you\u2019ve worked to earn this.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, not long after her interview with CNN, Maher posted a video on her social media accounts lamenting the concept of imposter syndrome and the fact that people often assume successful women have it.\n\nIlona Maher meets young Bristol Bears supporters at Ashton Gate stadium in Bristol, England, on December 8, 2024, after the club announced her signing. Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nHer unapologetic self continues to resonate. After her on-field debut with the Bristol Bears on January 5 \u2014 which featured a regular season league record crowd \u2014 Maher spent over an hour talking to fans, signing autographs and taking selfies.\n\n\u201cHopefully, what my fans see is also a person who\u2019s not perfect, who shows every side of themselves \u2026 it\u2019s a constant battle of learning to love and appreciate your body. It\u2019s never going to be, \u2018I got it. I figured it out,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe says she\u2019s grateful for the people who\u2019ve helped her see her own body in this light, highlighting the role of rugby \u2014 a sport that shows what the body is capable of.\n\n\u201cThat was what really helped me. And then my teammates \u2014 being around other women like that who are so confident kind of feeds into your confidence \u2026 It comes from inside,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cBut it also can come from those outside factors and surrounding yourself with really good people.\u201d",

                "text": "Wellington, New Zealand AP \u2014\n\nA Maine coon cat named Mittens became an accidental jetsetter this month when her cage was overlooked in a plane cargo hold and she made three trips in 24 hours between New Zealand and Australia.\n\nMittens, 8, was booked for one-way travel with her family from Christchurch, New Zealand to their new home in Melbourne, Australia on Jan. 13. But owner Margo Neas said Wednesday that as she waited for Mittens to be unloaded from the plane\u2019s freight area, three hours passed with no sign of the cat.\n\nIt was then that ground staff told Neas the plane had returned to New Zealand \u2014 with Mittens still on board. The return trip involves about 7.5 hours in the air.\n\n\u201cI said, how can this happen? How can this happen? Oh my God,\u201d Neas said.\n\nThe Air New Zealand pilot was told of the extra passenger during the flight and turned on the heating in the cargo hold to keep Mittens comfortable, she added. Neas was told that a stowed wheelchair had obscured a baggage handler\u2019s view of Mittens\u2019 cage.\n\n\u201cIt was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn\u2019t have the family, we weren\u2019t complete,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the saga had a happy ending. The pet moving company that Neas used to arrange Mittens\u2019 travel met the cat on her return to Christchurch and ensured she was back on the plane for another trip to Melbourne \u2014 this time just one way.\n\nMittens had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed.\n\n\u201cShe basically just ran into my arms and just snuggled up in here and just did the biggest cuddles of all time,\u201d Neas said. \u201cIt was just such a relief.\u201d\n\nAir New Zealand would reimburse all costs associated with Mittens\u2019 travel and has apologized for the distress caused, the airline said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work closely with our ground handler in Melbourne to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d said spokesperson Alisha Armstrong.\n\nMeanwhile Mittens, not usually an affectionate pet, is \u201cthe cuddliest she\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Neas.\n\n\u201cThe cat gets as much attention as she wants right now because we\u2019re just so absolutely and utterly relieved to have her back.\u201d",

                "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nFizzy, sparkling, carbonated or seltzer \u2014 no matter what you call it, water that tickles your nose is fun and refreshing, and for some, a welcome change from its flat cousin.\n\nOn social media, sparkling water has gained a following for its impact on body mass. Some believe fizzy water may increase weight, pointing to a February 2017 study that found carbonated beverages stimulate appetite by increasing ghrelin, the hunger hormone. However, that research was done in male rats and only 20 people and has never been replicated.\n\nThe more popular theory is that carbonated water may lead to weight loss. Fizzy bubbles may boost a feeling of fullness, and water itself helps the body burn fat by boosting metabolism \u2014 in fact, water is a critical part of lipolysis, which is how the body turns stored fat into energy.\n\nA new study explores a third explanation: Carbonated water may also lower blood glucose levels. That\u2019s beneficial for weight loss, experts say, because if blood sugar is kept on an even keel, with few spikes or dips, the body\u2019s cells can more effectively burn fat between meals for energy.\n\n\u201cWhen carbonated water is consumed, CO2 is absorbed into the blood vessels in the stomach,\u201d said study author Dr. Akira Takahashi, a physician in the dialysis center at Tesseikai Neurosurgical Hospital in Shijonawate, Japan, in an email.\n\nWhile some carbonated water is natural, created as volcanic gases infuse the water in natural springs with bubbles and minerals, most sparkling water is made by forcing carbon dioxide, or CO2, into water under intense pressure.\n\nOnce in the blood, CO2 is rapidly converted into bicarbonate ions as part of a process that maintains pH balance. This conversion then causes red blood cells to become more alkaline, Takahashi said. This increased alkalinity accelerates the process of glucose consumption in red blood cells, thus lowering glucose levels.\n\nNo significant weight loss\n\nThe study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health, was built upon 2004 research by Takahashi and his team on hemodialysis, a process that occurs during kidney dialysis when blood is filtered to remove waste and excess water. During hemodialysis, CO2 enters the blood, just as it does when carbonated water is consumed.\n\nWhile the November 2004 study did show blood sugar levels decrease when CO2 is added to blood, the new study concluded the amount of glucose burned during this process would not be enough for any significant weight loss.\n\n\u201cRed blood cells cannot fully \u2018burn\u2019 the glucose, and it will be recycled by the liver,\u201d said Keith Frayn, a professor emeritus of human metabolism at the University of Oxford in the UK, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cIf fizzy drinks were to be shown to lead to weight loss, it would much more likely be through effects on feelings of fullness,\u201d Frayn said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, however, sugar-sweetened fizzy drinks are recognized as a source of excess calories and likely to do just the opposite.\u201d\n\nIn addition, blood sugar levels were only temporarily lowered, Takahashi said, and the carbonated water would have a slight effect on calorie consumption.\n\n\u201cTherefore, carbonated water alone is unlikely to contribute significantly to weight loss,\u201d he said. \u201cA balanced diet and regular exercise remain essential for effective weight management.\u201d\n\nSparkling water will keep you hydrated, but don't count on it for weight loss, experts say. Westend61/Getty Images\n\nUse for optimal health\n\nStudies have shown people who drank two cups of water before meals lost more weight than those who did not. Another study found people who replaced diet beverages with water also benefited by losing pounds.\n\n\u201cSome of the patients I see for weight loss never feel satisfied,\u201d said Welstead, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThese are the folks who tell me, \u2018I\u2019m always hungry and I\u2019m always waiting for a snack,\u2019 and I think it can really help some of those people.\u201d\n\nStill, filling your belly with bubbly water can increase satiety and may be especially helpful for people who struggle with hunger pains, said registered dietitian Lori Welstead, who specializes in gastrointestinal nutrition at University of Chicago Medicine, a not-for-profit academic medical health system.\n\n\u201cBut be mindful of excess or added sugars, including some of the fake sugars, because those may be negative metabolically,\u201d she said.\n\nOther patients say they benefit from fizzy waters because the bubbles help clear their esophagus and stomach and move food along in the digestive system, she said.\n\n\u201cSome people with a \u2018slow\u2019 stomach, so to speak, find carbonation helps with their gut motility,\u201d Welstead said. \u201cSo we have some people for whom these sparkling or tonic waters can create fullness, and others for whom it helps with digestion.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t overdo it, she warns \u2014 more than one or two sparkling waters a day could really exacerbate gas and abdominal pain from the carbonation.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s coming in and they\u2019re saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, I\u2019m gassy, I\u2019m bloated, I\u2019m burping, I\u2019m feeling so sick all day,\u2019 it could be due to drinking five cans of carbonated water each day.\u201d",

                "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nNetflix announced Tuesday it will raise prices on most of its subscription tiers in the US and Canada after the streaming giant reported 19 million new subscribers in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nThe jump in subscribers, Netflix\u2019s biggest-ever, puts the streaming giant at 302 million globally, solidifying the company\u2019s hold on the top spot in the industry.\n\nNetflix attributed the service\u2019s latest success to the Mike Tyson and Jake Paul boxing match in November, which it said drew 108 million viewers worldwide, making it the most-streamed sporting event ever. Netflix later hosted two Christmas Day NFL games, which averaged 30 million global viewers, making them the most-streamed football games in history.\n\nSubscriptions were also buoyed by the success of \u201cSquid Game\u201d season two, the platform\u2019s biggest premiere to date, which drew 68 million views in its first week. Earlier this month, Netflix also added WWE \u201cRaw\u201d live broadcasts on Monday nights.\n\nThe price increases announced Tuesday will see the standard monthly membership without advertisements increase from $15.49 to $17.99, while a standard account with ads will rise one dollar to $7.99. Its highest-priced premium tier, which includes 4K video quality, will increase by $2 to $24.99.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix,\u201d the company said in a letter to investors.\n\nThe price hike is the latest for consumers as streaming services increasingly ratchet up monthly costs and push subscribers toward lower-priced ad-supported plans to increase profitability. In recent years, Disney, Max, Peacock, Apple and others have all raised their prices. Netflix last increased the price of its standard plan in 2022.\n\nThe company on Tuesday reported its revenue increased 16% last quarter, exceeding $10 billion for the first time in its history, while operating income totaled $2.3 billion, a 52% on-year increase. Netflix also announced a $15 billion stock buyback. The news sent shares soaring 13% Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOn the company\u2019s investor call, Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-chief executive, underscored the streamer\u2019s recent success with live sporting events.\n\n\u201cEven in an amazing quarter where we had three huge live events \u2014 we had an incredible fight, two NFL games \u2014 we had one of our biggest TV series ever in \u2018Squid Game\u2019 season two, all very successful events and titles that we are thrilled about,\u201d Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos added the company will continue to look to live events and sports for future growth.\n\n\u201cIf there was a path where we could actually make the economics work, for both us and the league, we certainly would explore,\u201d Sarandos said. \u201cBut, right now, we believe that the live events business is where we really want to be, and sports is a very important part of that, but it is a part of that expansion.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s earnings marks the final time Netflix will publicly report its paid membership figures on a quarterly basis. Instead, the company said it will begin reporting a twice annual \u201cengagement report\u201d with updates.\n\nThe surge in paid subscriptions cements Netflix\u2019s dominance in the streaming space. In recent years, legacy media companies have poured billions into launching their own streaming services to compete with Netflix as their traditional cable and broadcast businesses wither.\n\nWhile some competitors, including Disney and CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, have recently reached profitability in the streaming space for the first time, the rivals have struggled to match Netflix\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate that we don\u2019t have distractions like managing declining linear networks and, with our focus and continued investment, we have good and improving product/market fit around the world,\u201d Netflix said in its earnings report.",

                "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN \u2014\n\nHundreds of same-sex couples are expected to tie the knot across Thailand on Thursday as the country becomes the first in Southeast Asia to recognize marriage equality.\n\nThe landmark bill marks a momentous win for the LGBTQ+ community, which has fought for more than a decade for the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples.\n\n\u201cThis could be a model for the world because we now have Thailand as a model. There is true marriage equality in Thailand,\u201d said Kittinun Daramadhaj, a lawyer and president of Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand, one of many who has been campaigning for equality.\n\nUnder the legislation, passed by Thailand\u2019s parliament and endorsed by the king last year, same-sex couples will be able to register their marriages with full legal, financial, and medical rights, as well as adoption and inheritance rights.\n\nPrime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra hailed the country\u2019s success at an event last week, when she invited dozens of LGBTQ+ couples and activists to the government\u2019s offices.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace diversity and accept love in all its forms. Today shows that our country is open and accepting,\u201d she said.\n\nCelebrations will take place on Thursday in other parts of the country stretching from the eastern coastal city of Pattaya to the mountainous northern city of Chiang Mai.\n\nIn downtown Bangkok, at least 200 couples have signed up to get married in a mass wedding at a popular shopping mall, according to Bangkok Pride, which co-organized the event with local authorities.\n\nRainbow flags are expected to ripple through the heart of Bangkok, with a \u201cpride carpet\u201d to be rolled out at a celebration to welcome the newlyweds, and performances by celebrities and drag queens.\n\nA dream comes true\n\nFor some, such as Nina Chetniphat Chuadkhunthod, who will attend the mass celebration at the Siam Paragon shopping mall, the day feels long overdue.\n\nThe transgender woman has not been able to marry her boyfriend of 22 years because she is unable to legally change her gender identity. But with same-sex marriage now being recognized, they can tie the knot.\n\n\u201cI feel like, wow, my dream is close to coming true,\u201d the 42-year-old told CNN during a recent interview.\n\nChuadkhunthod and her fianc\u00e9e held their wedding party three weeks ago. At a wedding hall on the outskirts of Bangkok, the couple walked down the aisle in locked arms, as bridesmaids sprinkled their path with rose petals amid cheers from friends and relatives. They plan to register their marriage on Thursday.\n\nNina Chetniphat Chuadkhunthod, right, and her husband light a candle during their wedding at the Vivace Wedding Hall in Bangkok.

The girl is the daughter of Chuadkhunthod\u2019s uncle, who is unable to look after her.\n\nThey plan to adopt the girl and live a life as a family, but cannot do so without a valid marriage.\n\n\u201cI had tears flowing from my eyes when we were thinking about our lives (without the same-sex marriage law).

Unlike before, they wouldn\u2019t accept it in the hospital,\u201d Boncan said.\n\nThe fight goes on\n\nBut rights experts have warned Thailand may well be the last Asian jurisdiction to recognize same-sex marriage for some time, given the incremental progress elsewhere in the region.\n\nMore than 30 jurisdictions worldwide now recognize same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center, but most advances have been made in Europe, the Americas and Australasia.\n\nThailand is the third in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage after Taiwan in 2019 and Nepal four years later.\n\nA gay couple makes a toast during a mass wedding banquet in front of the Presidential Palace in Taipei, Taiwan on May 25, 2019.

                "text": "Baghdad, Iraq AP \u2014\n\nIraq\u2019s parliament passed three divisive laws Tuesday, including amendments to the country\u2019s personal status law that opponents say would in effect legalize child marriage.\n\nThe amendments give Islamic courts increased authority over family matters, including marriage, divorce and inheritance. Activists argue that this undermines Iraq\u2019s 1959 Personal Status Law, which unified family law and established safeguards for women.\n\nProponents of the changes, which were advocated by primarily conservative Shiite lawmakers, defend them as a means to align the law with Islamic principles and reduce Western influence on Iraqi culture.\n\nIraqi law currently sets 18 as the minimum age of marriage in most cases. The changes passed Tuesday would let clerics rule according to their interpretation of Islamic law, which some interpret to allow marriage of girls in their early teens \u2013 or as young as 9 under the Jaafari school of Islamic law followed by many Shiite religious authorities in Iraq.\n\nThe parliament also passed a general amnesty law seen as benefiting Sunni detainees and that\u2019s also seen as giving a pass to people involved in corruption and embezzlement. The chamber also passed a land restitution law aimed at addressing Kurdish territorial claims.\n\nIntisar al-Mayali, a human rights activist and a member of the Iraqi Women\u2019s League, said passage of the civil status law amendments \u201cwill leave disastrous effects on the rights of women and girls, through the marriage of girls at an early age, which violates their right to life as children, and will disrupt the protection mechanisms for divorce, custody and inheritance for women.\u201d\n\nThe session ended in chaos and accusations of procedural violations.\n\n\u201cHalf of the lawmakers present in the session did not vote, which broke the legal quorum,\u201d a parliamentary official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. He said that some members protested loudly and others climbed onto the parliamentary podium.\n\nAfter the session, a number of legislators complained about the voting process, under which all three controversial laws \u2014 each of which was supported by different blocs \u2014 were voted on together.\n\n\u201cRegarding the civil status law, we are strongly supporting it and there were no issues with that,\u201d said Raid al Maliki, an independent MP. \u201cBut it was combined with other laws to be voted on together\u2026and this might lead to a legal appeal at the Federal Court.\u201d\n\nParliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani in a statement praised the laws\u2019 passage as \u201can important step in the process of enhancing justice and organizing the daily lives of citizens.\u201d\n\nAlso Tuesday, at least three officers, including the national security chief of the al-Tarmiyah district north of Baghdad, were killed and four others wounded in an explosion at an ammunition depot, a security official said.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said the explosion occurred as a joint force of the Iraqi army and the national security service conducted an operation following intelligence reports of the Islamic State group\u2019s activity and an ammunition cache in the area.",

                "title": "Why Zelensky is reading Trump\u2019s script to Europe\u2019s elites",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe United States isn\u2019t the only country with a former TV star president who knows how to put on a show.\n\nConsider this rebuke to NATO countries on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAll European countries must be willing to spend as much on security as is truly needed, not just as much as they\u2019ve gotten used to during years of neglect. If it takes 5% of GDP to cover defense, then so be it, 5% it is.\u201d\n\nThis might sound like Donald Trump but isn\u2019t.\n\nThe demand for Europe to pony up comes from a sometime Trump antagonist, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 and it shows how the new US president is already turning things upside down across the world.\n\nSpeaking to Europe\u2019s elites at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky laid into many of the European countries that have helped keep Ukraine afloat since the Russian invasion, chiding them for not taking their own defense and the threat from Moscow sufficiently seriously.\n\nSo, what was he up to?\n\nZelensky clearly watched Trump\u2019s news conference Monday when he firmed up his demand for NATO states to up their target for defense spending from 2% of GDP to 5%. (This will be almost impossible for most states in slow-growth Europe to reach but may be an opening bid.) The new president also noted that Zelensky had told him he was open to a peace deal, and intriguingly, started to troll Russian President Vladimir Putin in a bit of pre-summit positioning. Trump argued that Putin was \u201cnot doing so well\u201d in Ukraine and that he should end the war because it was \u201cdestroying Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian president is among the nimblest of foreign leaders in adapting to the world represented by Trump\u2019s return to office. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s now thinking \u2013 so, what\u2019s going happen to their relationship with America?\u201d Zelensky said in Davos. \u201cWhat will happen to alliances? To support? To trade? How does President Trump plan to end wars?\u201d\n\nZelensky is smart to curry favor with Trump since he must shape the US president\u2019s push to end the war if he\u2019s to secure the best possible terms for his country. No doubt Trump will approve of him giving the Europeans a tongue lashing.\n\nBut Zelensky is being cruel to be kind, not least to himself.\n\nAny peace deal with Putin will require security guarantees that might demand the costly deployment of troops from European NATO members on Ukrainian soil. And the Ukrainians have learned what many states on the continent still prefer to ignore: the Russian invasion signals there\u2019s a new and belligerent threat in the East that will require a far more robust Western defense posture. And with Trump back in the White House, there\u2019s no guarantee the US is going to stick around.\n\n\u201cWill President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?\u201d Zelensky said. He went on: \u201cWill President Trump listen to Europe, or will he negotiate with Russia and China without Europe? \u2026 Europe needs to learn how to fully take care of itself, so that the world can\u2019t afford to ignore it.\u201d\n\nThis \u2013 from a nation that craves EU membership \u2013 is not a message that will go down especially well in Brussels, especially given the huge military and diplomatic support that Europe has offered to Kyiv over the last three years. It\u2019s not that different, however, from French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s frequent calls for Europe to pack more of a national security punch notwithstanding his government barely making NATO\u2019s 2% spending threshold.\n\nZelensky\u2019s true intent was revealed when he said: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not clear whether Europe will even have a seat at the table when the war against our country ends.\u201d\n\nUkraine really needs a strong, united Europe because Trump might be tempted to give Putin anything he wants just to end the war. The 47th president has long coveted a Nobel Peace Prize after all.\n\n\u201cI think Zelensky is trying to give Europe spine and they need it,\u201d Beth Sanner, a former senior US intelligence official, told CNN.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nInternational pressure is mounting on Thailand \u2013 including from the new US administration \u2013 over the fate of dozens of Uyghur men held in detention for more than a decade, following reports the Thai government planned to deport the group to China.\n\nUnited Nations experts on Tuesday urged Thailand to \u201cimmediately halt the possible transfer,\u201d warning the men were at \u201creal risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned.\u201d\n\nConcerns for the 48 men, who have been detained in Bangkok since 2014, are growing after a Uyghur activist shared a voice note from one of the detainees, who said the men had been on hunger strike since January 10 in a desperate protest against deportation.\n\nArslan Hidayat, an activist working with Justice for All\u2019s Save Uyghur campaign, told CNN he understands the men remained on hunger strike as of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are desperately seeking help from those living in the free world,\u201d the detainee said in a voice note that Hidayat published to Instagram. \u201cYou all know what will happen to us if we are sent back to China. This is our plea for help from your 48 brothers in Thailand.\u201d\n\nThe 48 men were arrested by Thai authorities 11 years ago after crossing the border to Thailand in an attempt to escape persecution in China. They were part of a larger group of about 350 people detained at the time, some of whom were minors, according to previous reports from UN experts, rights groups, and Uyghur campaigners.\n\nFive Uyghur detainees, including a newborn and a 3-year-old, have died in detention, the reports said.\n\nHuman rights groups and campaigners say that in the years since, the men have been held in \u201cin life-threatening conditions\u201d without access to lawyers, family members or UN representatives. Human Rights Watch said the men were living in \u201csqualid conditions with poor hygiene and inadequate medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are informed that 23 of the 48 individuals suffer from serious health conditions, including diabetes, kidney dysfunction, paralysis of the lower body, skin diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses, and heart and lung conditions,\u201d the eight UN experts said Tuesday. They include the UN special rapporteurs on torture and on migrants\u2019 human rights, and other independent human rights experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.\n\n\u201cIt is essential they be provided with the necessary and appropriate medical care,\u201d the UN experts added.\n\nFears the 48 would be imminently transferred to Chinese custody arose on January 8 when Thai authorities reportedly gave the detainees \u201cvoluntary return\u201d documents to sign, according to the Save Uyghur campaign. Detainees told the group their photos were taken and reported an increase in threats of deportation from officials in the immigration detention center.\n\nThai officials have denied plans to deport the Uyghurs, according to local media. CNN has reached out to Thai police and the country\u2019s defense minister for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday: \u201cThe matter involves judicial cooperation between two sovereign states.\u201d\n\nUN experts should abide by the principle of the UN charter and \u201crefrain from interfering with the judicial sovereignty of the member states \u2026 rather than making irresponsible remarks,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing.\n\nLong persecuted minority\n\nThe predominately Muslim Uyghurs are a distinct ethnic minority from Xinjiang, a massive, nominally autonomous region in the far west of China.\n\nChina\u2019s repression of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang has been labeled \u201cgenocide\u201d by the US and other countries, with widespread and credible reports of arbitrary detention, mass surveillance, forced labor and restrictions on movement \u2013 allegations China vehemently denies.\n\nA landmark 2022 report from the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights said China had committed \u201cserious human rights violations\u201d against the Uyghurs, documenting what it described as arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominately Muslim groups.\n\nAt the time, more than 1 million Uyghur and other Muslim minority peoples were estimated to be held in extrajudicial camps for \u201cre-education\u201d and indoctrination. Descriptions of detentions \u201cwere marked by patterns of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d the UN report found.\n\nChina has fiercely denied committing rights violations. It has previously said it established such centers to counter \u201cextremism\u201d in the region, and has since said the facilities were closed.\n\nA letter from the 48 detainees dated January 10 said: \u201cWe urgently appeal to all international organizations and countries concerned with human rights to intervene immediately to save us from this tragic fate before it is too late.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch said they face \u201crisks of enforced disappearance, long-term imprisonment, torture, and other severe mistreatment,\u201d if they are forcibly repatriated.\n\nPressure on Thailand\n\nAmong the prominent voices adding pressure on Thailand was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told his Senate confirmation hearing ahead of being sworn in Tuesday that he would lobby Bangkok against deporting the Uyghur men.\n\n\u201cThailand is actually a very strong US partner, strong historical ally as well,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how important that relationship (is) and how close it is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, John Moolenarr, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, wrote a letter to Thailand\u2019s Ambassador to the US last week expressing his alarm over the reports and urged the government to release the men to a third country.\n\nThe UN experts also called on Thailand, which is a member of the UN Human Rights Council, to respect its obligations under international law.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition on refoulement prohibits the return or transfer in any manner whatsoever to a country where there is real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Southeast Asian kingdom is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and does not recognize the concept of asylum. Thailand has a history of pushing refugees back across its borders and of deporting dissidents.\n\nIn 2015, Thailand deported 100 Uyghurs to China, sparking international outcry. The fate and whereabouts of those returned are unknown, UN experts said last year.\n\nIn the same move, more than 170 Uyghur women and children were voluntarily transferred to Turkey. Many families were separated, including those of the men still in detention in Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe call for a prompt, effective investigation, and assessment of all the circumstances of the arrest and continued deprivation of liberty of this group of persons,\u201d the UN experts said Tuesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kocha Olarn contributed to this report from Bangkok, Thailand.",

Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images In pictures: Deadly wildfires in Los Angeles County Prev Next\n\nLos Angeles bracing once again\n\nFirefighting teams pre-deployed in anticipation of the high winds and greater fire risk, officials said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department \u201chas deployed all available resources and strategically positioned fire patrols and fire engines in the high-risk areas across the city of Los Angeles \u2026 we are also strategically managing our emergency operations to ensure a rapid response to all new fires,\u201d Crowley said.\n\nAdditionally, firefighting teams from around the region have also pre-positioned fire engines and firefighting aircraft across Southern California, according to Crowley.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has completed an \u201cexhaustive\u201d search for any missing persons or people who died within the Palisades Fire burn area within the city of Los Angeles, Assistant Chief Dominic Choi said Tuesday.\n\nPolice have also established a staging area for residents of one Palisades neighborhood to be escorted safely to their properties and are working on offering more escorts as additional burn zones are deemed safe and stable enough.\n\n\u201cAll of our unified commanders are doing everything they can to allow safe access to the residents in this community as soon as they can. And I thank all of you for your patience,\u201d Choi said.\n\nResidents at the staging area must provide identification or documentation proving they live in the community and will be provided with kits containing N95 masks and goggles to use in the burn zones, said Choi.\n\nRain may be on the horizon\n\nExceptionally dry air is expected to remain across Southern California, with relative humidity levels dropping to between 1% and 10%, but a low-pressure system expected to move into the area over the weekend could bring the first rainfall of the year so far.\n\nWhile rainfall is not expected to exceed a half an inch, any amount is useful to help with containment and to slow the ongoing increases in drought for the area.\n\nDowntown Los Angeles last saw 0.1 inches of rainfall on May 5, 2024 \u2013 258 days ago \u2013 and has only seen 0.16 inches of rainfall since October 1. With no rainfall since the start of 2025, 90% of Los Angeles County is now in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nBut the possible rain could be a mixed blessing for a region blighted with chemically contaminated burn scars in areas prone to mudslide.\n\nLocal leaders are preparing for any negative impact the rain could have on the scorched earth.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she issued an executive order \u201cto shore up burn areas and stem the flow of toxic debris\u201d should it rain over the weekend.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has extended an ocean advisory warning residents to avoid any contact with the water at certain beaches.\n\n\u201cAsh from the Los Angeles Fires may enter coastal water through surface water runoff and windblown ash. The ash may contain substances including arsenic, other metals, and asbestos, which can be harmful to human health,\u201d the advisory said.\n\nThe advisory extends from Surfrider Beach to Dockweiler State Beach.\n\n\u201cI normally pray for rain. God knows we generally need it,\u201d Los Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park, who represents the Palisades district, said Tuesday. \u201cBut right now, let me point out the obvious, the burn scar of the Palisades fire not only sits feet from the ocean itself, but already on hillsides that are already prone to slide.\u201d\n\nThe City Council approved her motion instructing the Bureau of Engineering and LA Sanitation to create a comprehensive waste mitigation and slope stabilization plan, according to Park.\n\nShe said the rain will spread the hazardous materials and contaminants left after the fires. \u201cWhen it rains, they flow into our gutters and storm drains, our creeks and waterways, and eventually, our beaches and ocean,\u201d Park said.\n\nPresident Trump comes to town\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he will visit California on Friday to survey the damage caused by the devastating wildfires.\n\n\u201cI \u2026 want to send our love to everyone affected by the terrible wildfires raging in California,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump previously said he had not spoken to California Gov. Gavin Newsom since the outbreak of the wildfires, but has slammed the governor and other Democratic officials over the fire response and called them \u201cincompetent \u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris flew to Los Angeles Monday afternoon, visited a fire station and distributed food to community members impacted by the wildfires.\n\nHarris is from California and before she was vice president served as a US senator representing California and the attorney general of the state.\n\nCNN\u2019s Robert Shackelford contributed to this report.",

                "title": "The artist creating mind-bending images of an alternate Hong Kong through AI",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBianca Tse is among a growing number of artists embracing AI. \u201cIt\u2019s shortened the path between my ideas and my visions,\u201d said the 43-year-old, sitting in front of \u201cBreathing Room,\u201d a photo recently showcased at the Blue Lotus Gallery in Hong Kong.\n\nIn it, three Chinese men appear to sit comfortably, albeit precariously, on stools atop a narrow tower of derelict flats.\n\nThis photograph could not exist in real life, she said, but it captures the feel of the city\u2019s cramped living conditions, and a distinct Hong Kong \u201cflavor.\u201d\n\nTse\u2019s work is part fantasy \u2014 generated from AI \u2014 and part historical reference, drawing from her own childhood memories and the history of Hong Kong\u2019s working class. Many of her images are set in an AI-exaggerated version of the Kowloon Walled City \u2014 a former Qing dynasty fortress that became the most densely populated place on Earth. Refugees fleeing from mainland China during the Chinese civil war, flooded into then-British ruled Hong Kong and had made the enclave their home.\n\nIt was demolished in the 1990s but still looms large in the memories of Hong Kong residents.\n\nBy working with AI, Tse said she has learned not to fear the technology. \u201cI think if everyone tried to use AI, they\u2019d know that the role of the artist or designer cannot be replaced,\u201d she explained. Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\nIn \u201cOverpopulation,\u201d a precarious-looking tower of people stand shoulder-to-shoulder. The Kowloon Walled City was \u201cnot a monstrosity of concrete and steel,\u201d Tse said, but rather \u201ca complex organism woven with resilient human narratives.\u201d Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\nWhile she never visited the Walled City, Tse has been fascinated by its history, and sees it as representative of a Hong Kong that is culturally and architecturally disappearing amid ongoing development and gentrification.\n\nThrough interviews and rare, personal photographs, Tse has been able to expand on some former residents\u2019 memories in a new way. She has recreated scenes inspired by their lives in the form of short AI-generated videos and pictures.\n\nThe role of AI in art\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence to create art has become increasingly controversial, with artists expressing concern that their work can be used to train AI models without compensation. While Tse agrees, she said AI tools like Midjourney have also allowed her to make works that would be otherwise impossible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to hire actors, I don\u2019t need to set up all the scenes, and, yeah, it saves a lot of time, and mainly money, because nobody is going to invest in me to create all of these (pieces),\u201d she said.\n\nThe technology has opened up a new world for Tse, a freelance advertising creative director, who has been posting her AI experiments on Instagram.\n\nThe French gallery La Grande Vitrine included her early work in the Rencontres d\u2019Arles exhibition \u201cA State of Consciousness\u201d in France in 2023.\n\nAnd more recently, she\u2019s shown alongside photographers Greg Girard and Ian Lambot \u2014 two photographers who famously documented the Kowloon Walled City \u2014 as part of Blue Lotus Gallery\u2019s \u201cVoices of The Walls,\u201d exhibition about the informal settlement, where an estimated 33,000 people lived within the space of one city block.\n\nTse\u2019s sense of surrealism is grounded in reality. In her broader depictions of Hong Kong, she focuses on details such as the particular way the paint peels, the concrete walls stain and corrugated metal roofing rusts. These textures might not typically get noticed, and can be overshadowed in the dystopic, cyberpunk depictions of the city found in video games such as \u201cStray\u201d and movies like \u201cBatman Begins.\u201d\n\nThe people in her images also feel familiar. They include muscular bamboo-scaffolding builders, a woman in a quintessential Hong Kong barbershop with a mountain of metal rollers in her hair, and the aforementioned men in wrinkled shirts sitting hunched on thin-legged stools.\n\nOne recurring theme Tse explores is how chaos and poverty exists right alongside happiness and hope.\n\n\u201cImaginary Friends\u201d shows a little girl in a market surrounded by trash bags transformed into stuffed animals, and is actually based on her own childhood memories of waiting for her mother in the rain outside the frozen meat shop where she worked.\n\nOne recurring theme Tse explores is how chaos and poverty exists right alongside happiness and hope. Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\nA depiction of muscular bamboo scaffolders in a gravity-defying stance. Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\n\u201cI was living in temporary housing \u2014 a metal sheet temporary home with two floors, in Fanling, with two bunk beds. I think (it was) under 100 square feet,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cI only realized I was poor when I grew up,\u201d she added. \u201cI had a really happy childhood, maybe because of the lack of parental guidance. Because my parents both went to work, I just go about freely, especially after school.\u201d\n\nAn untaken photo\n\nBy working with generative AI software, Tse has learned not to fear human artists becoming obsolete.\n\n\u201cI think if everyone tried to use AI, they\u2019d know that the role of the artist or designer cannot be replaced,\u201d she said. Prompting with a single word might be easy, she explained, but \u201cif you really want to create something close to your vision or something meaningful, it is actually very hard.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate her point, Tse pulls up a string of images of failed prompts she created in Midjourney: a contact sheet of Asian men, women and children with a pile of noodles for hair, comically positioned and that look more like a slapdash Photoshop job than the surreal, polished works of art in her portfolio.\n\nTo lessen the uncanny valley effect \u2014 the eerie sensation people feel when faced with something artificial but nearly human \u2014 Tse does a great deal of post-production work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like generating perfect-looking humans. I like someone who looks more like daily life,\u201d Tse said.\n\nThis was one of the challenges she faced when she collaborated with Girard, on creating a \u201cphoto that got away.\u201d\n\nIn the late 1980s, Girard, who had been photographing the Kowloon Walled City, had seen a Cathay Pacific flight attendant get out of a cab and walk into the City, pulling her luggage behind her. Her elegance and poise were a stark contrast to the gritty surroundings, but he lost her in the maze of alleys before he was able to take a shot.\n\nThough he waited around, hoping to see her again, he never did.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it, and I thought (the image) was gone forever,\u201d he said.\n\nIn this \"Untaken Photo\" Tse collaborated with photographer Greg Girard on a photo he missed taking in the late 1980s, when he saw a Cathay Pacific flight attendant get out of a cab and walk into the Kowloon Walled City. Greg Girard and Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\nThe outcome was \"very close\" to how Girard said he remembered it. Greg Girard and Bianca Tse/Midjourney\n\nBut with the photographer\u2019s blessing, Tse fed his photographs and a series of prompts into Midjourney, going through several thousand versions, she said, to make the woman and the photograph look real.\n\nGirard said he was interested to collaborate because Tse\u2019s work is \u201csuch a departure\u201d from his own. \u201cI was curious where she would take it.\n\n\u201cWhat won me over was that she (Tse) asked, straight up, for permission,\u201d he added in a phone interview. \u201cBecause so many people just steal it and you discover it later and then go about trying to deal with that. She was very correct and straight out.\u201d\n\nThe outcome was \u201cvery close\u201d to the way Girard remembers it.\n\n\u201cIt felt somehow both a little disorienting but also satisfying, to have someone else make a picture of what was going on inside your own head.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nHow do you perk up a lonely fish? This may sound like the start of a particularly silly joke, but it was a very real challenge faced by staff at a Japanese aquarium when they noticed their sunfish was ailing.\n\nAlmost as soon as the Kaikyokan Aquarium in Shimonoseki, southern Japan closed for renovation in December 2024, the sunfish became unwell, the aquarium said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out the cause and took various measures, but one of the staff members said, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s lonely because it misses the visitors?\u2019 We thought 99% chance \u2018No way!\u2019 But we attached the uniforms of the staff members (to the tank)\u201d with a little bit of hope, the aquarium said.\n\n\u201cThen\u2026the next day, it was in good health again!\u201d\n\nA picture posted by the aquarium shows the sunfish swimming in its tank, one of its eyes turned toward makeshift \u201cpeople\u201d made from cardboard cutout faces and aquarium uniforms on hangers stuck to the glass. Staff have been waving at the sunfish, too, in an effort to cheer it up.\n\nA lonely sunfish does seem unlikely, the aquarium said, but it added that this fish is curious and would swim up to the front of its tank whenever people came to visit.\n\nBut once visitors stopped coming, it stopped eating its jellyfish meals and began to rub its body against the tank, leading staff to suspect that it had developed digestive issues or was infected by parasites, Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.\n\nOcean sunfish live in the open sea in temperate and tropical regions all over the world, and have washed ashore in places as varied as Australia, California, Portugal, Spain and Oregon. They can grow staggeringly large, weighing up to 1,900 kilograms (more than 3,300 pounds) and measuring up to 3.3 meters (nearly 11 feet) long. This specimen in the aquarium is much smaller, but it shares the lopsided bullet-shaped body and long fins that give the species such a distinctive look.\n\nAnother Japanese aquarium came up with a similarly creative solution to keep its animals used to human interaction. During the Covid lockdown in 2020, Tokyo\u2019s Sumida Aquarium asked for volunteers to FaceTime its 300 spotted garden eels, who had become shy without the presence of visitors, making it difficult for staff to check up on them and make sure they were healthy.",

He returned to the court with his upper left leg taped up.\n\nDjokovic and Carlos Alcaraz share a warm embrace at the net after the match ended. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nTrailing the match and managing an injury, Djokovic attempted to shorten the rallies through the second set and it was a tactic that worked \u2013 the former world No.1 leveled the scores and began growing into the match.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m still in the tournament, I don\u2019t want to reveal too much,\u201d Djokovic said about his injury.\n\n\u201cBut the medication started to kick in and they helped, no doubt. I had to take another dose. If I lost that second set, I don\u2019t know if I would continue playing, but I felt better and better.\u201d\n\nRod Laver Arena was then treated to a magical display of tennis as Djokovic and Alcaraz went toe-to-toe. The moment of the match was perhaps the pulsating 33-shot rally, which Alcaraz managed to win in the fourth set to rescue a break point.\n\nBut it was Djokovic who came up clutch in the vital moments, letting out an emotional roar after winning match point.\n\n\u201cI wish this match today was the final,\u201d Djokovic added.\n\nDjokovic rolled back the years with a brilliant performance. Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nHe will now have the chance to rest before facing Alexander Zverev in the semifinals on Friday.\n\n\u201cI guess the key is recovery for me. To be honest, that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about. The extra day with no match comes at the perfect time for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if it\u2019s going to be good enough on Friday, hopefully I can come out and feel my best because Sasha (Zverev) is playing some of the best tennis he has played.\u201d\n\nIt was a tough defeat for Alcaraz who was bidding to become the youngest man to complete a career slam \u2013 an achievement consisting of winning Wimbledon, US Open, French Open and the Australian Open.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPope Francis is taking the highly unusual decision to dissolve an influential Catholic group from Peru which has been plagued by allegations of abuse from within its community, including allegations related to its founder, for more than a decade.\n\nNews of the decision to dissolve the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which at one point had 20,000 members across South America and parts of the United States, was confirmed in a statement by the group, although the Vatican has yet to comment or publish anything official about the move.\n\nThe decision to suppress the Sodalitium was first reported by Spanish-language site Infovaticana with the Sodalitum saying the \u201ccentral information\u201d in that report was true but that \u201cit contained several inaccuracies,\u201d although it did not specify what these were.\n\nA papal decision to dissolve or suppress a Catholic religious community is rare and in the Sodalitium\u2019s case follows attempts by the church hierarchy to reform the group and a 2023 Vatican investigation which uncovered \u201csadistic\u201d abuses of power, authority and spirituality. Its founder, Luis Fernando Figari, had earlier been found to have sodomized recruits along with accusations of serious financial mismanagement, according to a 2017 outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium.\n\nFigari has denied all the allegations against him. CNN has contacted the Vatican for comment.\n\nAfter the Vatican probe carried out by Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, Figari was expelled from the order by the pope in August 2024 and a month later the pope expelled 10 more of its leading members. One of those expelled was found to have carried out \u201cabuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism,\u201d an unusual charge.\n\nA victim of Figari told CNN last year that he was abused at least three times in the 1970s at the age of 17 with him and other victims looking to the Vatican investigation and papal response to bring a measure of justice.\n\nBut the victims have waited years for church authorities to act, with victims lodging complaints with the Archdiocese of Lima in 2011 and reportedly even earlier. A turning point came with a 2015 book, \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d written by one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, and journalist Paola Ugaz.\n\nUgaz told CNN she believed the pope\u2019s decision is \u201cunprecedented\u201d as it is the first time that \u201ca Catholic organization that abused its members and committed economic misconduct\u201d has been suppressed. Her journalism, she said, had led to a \u201ctsunami of persecution that the Sodalitium directed against me for seven years\u201d and that she owed \u201cinvaluable gratitude\u201d to the pope.\n\nFounded in 1971 in Peru as a lay group (a \u201cSociety of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right\u201d), the Sodalitium exercised huge influence as it sought to recruit mostly young white boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links.\n\nIt was also politically driven as a fight back against the rise of liberation theology in Latin America, a radical movement which began in the 1960s and focussed on supporting the poor.\n\nSalinas told CNN last year that the group\u2019s thinking mixed \u201cthe Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d while the 2017 investigation described Figari as \u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist, and obsessed with sexual issues.\u201d That report also found that sexual, physical and psychological abuse took place in the order.",

                "text": "Seoul, South Korea (Reuters) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol attended on Tuesday a Constitutional Court hearing of his impeachment trial where he denied ordering military commanders to drag lawmakers out of parliament during his short-lived bid to impose martial law.\n\nNear the start of the hearing, Yoon said he had worked in public service with \u201ca firm commitment to free democracy,\u201d when invited by the acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, to speak.\n\nDressed in a navy-colored suit with a burgundy tie, Yoon, a career prosecutor before his 2022 election as president, pledged to answer any questions the court might have.\n\nYoon has been incarcerated since last week under a separate criminal probe on charges of leading an insurrection with his attempt to impose martial law in early December, a move that shocked the nation and was overturned within hours by parliament.\n\nYoon told the hearing that special forces troops sent to parliament on Dec. 3 were not there to disable the legislature or prevent it from blocking his martial law because he knew such an action would have led to an indefensible crisis.\n\n\u201cIn this country, parliament and news media are far more powerful than the president, in a far superior position,\u201d he told the court.\n\nHis lawyers outlined arguments in defense of Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, saying it was meant to sound the alarm over abuses committed by the opposition Democratic Party.\n\nThey argued the opposition\u2019s actions had paralyzed government and pushed the country\u2019s democratic and constitutional order to the brink of collapse.\n\n\u201cThe decree was intended simply to establish the format of martial law and never intended to be executed, nor was it possible to execute it because of the potential for conflict with higher-level laws,\u201d lawyer Cha Gi-hwan told the court.\n\nCha also denied testimony by military commanders involved in the martial law declaration who said Yoon and his top aides ordered the arrest of some members of parliament who had politically clashed with the president.\n\nThe opposition Democratic Party, joined by minority parties and also 12 members of Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, voted with a two-thirds majority to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14.\n\nHelicopters landing at parliament\n\nThe Constitutional Court began the trial on Dec. 27 to review an impeachment motion that accused Yoon of violating his constitutional duty by imposing martial law with no justifiable grounds.\n\nThe parliament\u2019s legal team presented testimony from military commanders and video footage showing military helicopters landing on parliament grounds with special forces troops breaking into the main building, as well as troops moving in on the National Election Commission.\n\nOne of the lawyers also criticized unproven claims of irregularities at the election commission, which Yoon cited as a factor for justifying martial law.\n\n\u201cIn South Korea\u2019s current national chaos, the conspiracy theory of election fraud can destroy our community itself,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to remove Yoon from office permanently or reinstate him.\n\nYoon was driven to the hearing from the Seoul Detention Centre, where he is being held, in a correctional service vehicle escorted by a Presidential Security Service motorcade.\n\nHe was permitted to change from the khaki prison uniform he currently has to wear.\n\nAfter the hearing, Yoon visited a medical facility to receive medical attention with prior authorization from the head of the detention center, the Justice Ministry which oversees correctional service said in a statement.\n\nIt did not provide further details on privacy grounds.\n\nYoon\u2019s decision to attend the impeachment hearing contrasts with his vigorous resistance to criminal proceedings against him where he has refused to answer summons by investigators or attend interrogation sessions.\n\nYoon\u2019s legal team has denied he masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even technically by the death penalty.\n\nSecurity was heightened at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, after a mob of angry Yoon supporters went on a rampage through the district court that issued a warrant to extend his detention early on Sunday.\n\nDozens of police buses were lined bumper-to-bumper on both sides of the street, keeping hundreds of Yoon supporters more than 100 meters (109 yards) away from the court.",

Georgia officials reported one death from hypothermia at a news conference Tuesday, saying the individual was outside the night prior. Another death is also believed to have been caused by hypothermia, involving an 80-year-old man in Milwaukee who fell outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. At least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions early Tuesday morning in Zavala County, Texas, according to CNN affiliate WOAI/KABB, citing authorities.\n\n\u2022 Record snowfall: Snow is falling from southeast Texas through Louisiana and into parts of Mississippi and Alabama Tuesday, creating treacherous conditions. An area stretching from Houston into Alabama has recorded widespread snowfall of 3 to 6 inches, with at least one locale hitting the double-digit mark. Eight inches of snowfall was recorded at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Tuesday according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans; the previous modern record was 2.7 inches in 1963. Florida has likely broken its all-time statewide snow record, with at least 5.5 inches recorded in Molino \u2013 a record that has stood since 1954. Mobile, Alabama, has so far recorded more than five inches of snow, breaking a 143-year-old record for one-day snowfall. A record amount of snow is forecast for New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u2022 Unprecedented blizzard warning issued: Heavy snow and strong wind gusts combined to create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana, where snow totals of 3 to 6 inches are already widespread. It prompted the first-ever blizzard warning anywhere along the Gulf Coast from the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, for parts of southern Louisiana and far eastern Texas.\n\nSNOW in HOUSTON! \ud83e\udd0d\u2744\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HoYn62z35n \u2014 University of Houston (@UHouston) January 21, 2025\n\n\u2022 Widespread closures: Snow has closed or hindered operations at multiple airports in the South, contributing to the more than 2,300 flight cancellations into or out of US airports Tuesday \u2013 and more than 900 cancellations so far Wednesday. Large sections of Interstate 10 \u2014 the Gulf Coast\u2019s major thoroughfare \u2014 in Texas and Louisiana are closed Tuesday as snow and some icy mix make travel difficult to impossible. Major roads were closed across the New Orleans area. Schools and government offices are closed Tuesday throughout the Gulf Coast and states of emergency are active in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\n\n\u2022 Bitter cold: Low temperatures and wind chills from the Canadian border to the Mexican border are hitting dangerous levels for the second consecutive day.

Snow even covered sandy beaches along Texas\u2019 coast Tuesday morning.\n\nThe sweeping system is \u201ca generational winter storm event,\u201d the National Weather Service said Monday \u2014 and urged those along its path to take it seriously.\n\nRoads overnight and Tuesday will be \u201cextremely hazardous if not impossible for much of the area, and travel is highly discouraged,\u201d the service said. Schools are closed in states including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nThe complex mess of wintry weather spread east to reach more of Mississippi and into Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and the western Florida Panhandle throughout the day.\n\nGalveston, Texas, sees snow on the beach Tuesday morning. Visit Galveston/San Luis Hotel\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp warned people in the state to stay off roads because the sudden onset of snow later in the day, in places like Atlanta, could catch people off guard. Indeed, there were impacts to the roadways by early evening, particularly south of Interstate 20, according to Georgia Department of Transportation spokesperson Natalie Dale. \u201cPlow crews are having trouble treating some areas due to non-incident related congestion,\u201d she said, encouraging motorists to avoid travel.\n\n\u201cThis could deteriorate very quickly like it did in 2014,\u201d Gov. Kemp said. A few inches of snow that year paralyzed Atlanta with countless traffic incidents that trapped drivers in what became known as \u201cSnowmageddon.\u201d\n\nThe rare winter storm comes as 33 million people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina under winter weather alerts, with more than 200 million people in the US affected by bitterly cold air more broadly. The Upper Midwest and Northern Plains recorded wind chills to 50 degrees below zero Monday and were experiencing 40 degrees below zero Tuesday morning \u2014 temperatures that can cause frostbite on exposed skin in a matter of minutes.\n\nAir and road travel halted; schools shut down\n\nOfficials in affected states in the South cautioned people to stay off the roads, keep faucets dripping to prevent pipes from freezing, check batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes.\n\nGovernors in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have declared states of emergency, while Texas authorities have directed state agencies to mobilize resources for the rare snowfall. In North Carolina, officials have deployed parts of the state National Guard to the eastern reaches of the state to support local emergency services.\n\n\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,\u201d Louisiana climatologist Jay Grymes said Monday.\n\nTravel was paralyzed along the Interstate 10 corridor with portions already receiving widespread snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches. More than half a foot of snow had fallen by Tuesday afternoon along a portion of I-10 in southwestern Louisiana. One location just north of Rayne, Louisiana, recorded 10.5 inches of snow before noon. Cold weather will lock any snow and ice that falls into place, keeping roads hazardous.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon, the Louisiana State Patrol had responded to more than 50 weather-related calls for service and numerous crashes across the state.\n\nSimilar warnings were echoed in neighboring Florida. \u201cOur infrastructure is designed differently than states that are used to this (winter weather),\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a Tuesday news conference. \u201cThe state has done a lot to prepare but \u2026 driving in icy conditions, it can be very, very hazardous.\u201d\n\nCars travel on a snow-covered highway Tuesday in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nDisruptions were also reported in the skies, with more than a dozen airports in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia closed to commercial flights as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThere were more than 2,300 flight cancellations within, into or out of the US Tuesday morning, with most of those flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Nearly all flights to or from New Orleans International Airport were canceled by 10 a.m. CST.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Lafayette Regional Airport was closed Tuesday due to ice and snow on runways, the airport said. Mississippi\u2019s Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport also closed its terminal and runway \u201cuntil weather permits a safe reopening.\u201d The Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama closed around 9:15 a.m. CT, spokesperson Devon Calametti told CNN, with plans to reopen at noon Wednesday.\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee International Airport said it would suspend all operations at 4 p.m. CT with plans to reopen Wednesday at noon. And Jacksonville International Airport will close after its last departing flight Tuesday evening, around 8 p.m. Again, the airport plans to reopen at noon Wednesday.\n\nHouston\u2019s two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, are also closed Tuesday, while Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest, is pretreating roadways and airfield surfaces in preparation for the winter weather, according to spokesperson Andrew Gobeil.\n\nSchools across the Deep South were closed or moved online Tuesday from Texas to Florida. In Georgia, Gwinnett County Public Schools, the state\u2019s largest school district, has moved all its classes online. The Houston Independent School District, the largest in the Lone Star state and the eighth largest in the country, will also be closed until Wednesday.\n\nLesley Martin and her 4-year-old daughter Layla Richardson walk on a snow covered street in New Orleans Tuesday morning.

                "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIf you are using your smartphone to navigate, your system just got a crucial update. Scientists have released a new model tracking the position of the magnetic north pole, revealing that the pole is now closer to Siberia than it was five years ago and is continuing to drift toward Russia.\n\nUnlike the geographic North Pole, which marks a fixed location, the magnetic north pole\u2019s position is determined by Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which is in constant motion. Over the past few decades, magnetic north\u2019s movement has been unprecedented \u2014 it dramatically sped up, then in a more recent twist rapidly slowed \u2014 though scientists can\u2019t explain the underlying cause behind the magnetic field\u2019s unusual behavior.\n\nGlobal positioning systems, including those used by planes and ships, find magnetic north using the World Magnetic Model, as it was named in 1990. Developed by the British Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this model notes the established position of magnetic north and predicts future drift based on the trajectory of the past few years. To preserve the accuracy of GPS measurements, every five years researchers revise the WMM, resetting the official position of magnetic north and introducing new predictions for the next five years of drifting.\n\n\u201cThe more you wait to update the model, the larger the error becomes,\u201d said Dr. Arnaud Chulliat, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. \u201cThe way the model is built, our forecast is mostly an extrapolation given our current knowledge of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\u201d\n\nThe scientists released two models on December 17: the standard WMM, with a spatial resolution of approximately 2,051 miles (3,300 kilometers) at the equator, and the first high-resolution model, with spatial resolution of about 186 miles (300 kilometers) at the equator. While anyone can use the more powerful high-resolution model, most GPS hardware used by the general public incorporates the standard WMM and isn\u2019t equipped to handle the other \u2014 and many users won\u2019t benefit from the upgrade, said Dr. William Brown, a geophysicist and geomagnetism researcher with the British Geological Survey, in an email.\n\n\u201cMajor airlines will upgrade the navigation software across their entire fleets of aircraft to load in the new model, and militaries in NATO will need to upgrade software in a huge number of complex navigation systems across all kinds of equipment,\u201d Brown told CNN. But for most people, the switch isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n\u201cThink of it like upgrading your smartphone \u2014 you don\u2019t necessarily want to buy a new phone just to upgrade an app to a new version that is more powerful,\u201d he said.\n\nChanging to the new model should be a seamless transition for GPS users; with the update, scientists verified the accuracy of the previous model\u2019s predictions about where magnetic north would end up by 2025, Chulliat said.\n\n\u201cThe forecast was very good,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the new model confirmed that we were not very far off.\u201d\n\nBut why are all these updates necessary, and why doesn\u2019t magnetic north stay in one place?\n\nThis image shows magnetic declination, or the angle between magnetic and geographic north, according to the World Magnetic Model released in 2025. Red is magnetic north to the east of geographic north; blue is to the west. BGS/UKRI/Wessel, P./W. H. F. Smith\n\nMagnetic north versus \u2018true north\u2019\n\nAt the top of the world in the middle of the Arctic Ocean lies the geographic North Pole, the point where all the lines of longitude that curve around Earth from top to bottom converge in the north.\n\nMarking the North Pole is challenging, as it\u2019s covered by moving sea ice, but its geographic location, also known as the true North Pole, is fixed.\n\nBy comparison, the magnetic north pole is the northernmost convergence point in Earth\u2019s magnetic field, also known as the magnetosphere. Generated by the churning molten metals in Earth\u2019s core, the magnetosphere shields the planet from harmful solar radiation and keeps solar winds from stripping away Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nBecause the convective sloshing at Earth\u2019s core never stops, the magnetosphere is never static. As a result, its northernmost point is always on the move.\n\nBritish explorer Sir James Clark Ross discovered the magnetic north pole in 1831 in northern Canada, approximately 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) south of the true North Pole. We now know that every day, magnetic north traces an elliptical path of about 75 miles (120 kilometers).\n\nSince its discovery, magnetic north has drifted away from Canada and toward Russia. By the 1940s, magnetic north had moved northwest from its 1831 position by about 250 miles (400 kilometers). In 1948, it reached Prince Wales Island, and by 2000 it had departed Canadian shores.\n\n\u201cIt has typically moved about 10 km (6.2 miles) per year or less over the last 400 years,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHowever, the latest WMM update follows a period of highly unusual activity for the magnetic north pole. In 1990, its northern drift accelerated, increasing from 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) per year to 34.2 miles (55 kilometers) per year, Chulliat said. The shift \u201cwas unprecedented as far as the records we have,\u201d he added.\n\nAround 2015, the drift slowed to about 21.7 miles (35 kilometers) per year. The rapid deceleration was also unprecedented, Chulliat said. By 2019, the fluctuations had deviated so far from the prior model that scientists updated the WMM a year early.\n\nThe animation above shows the magnetic north pole's drift from 1840 to 2019. ESA/geoGraphics\n\nFuture drift\n\nScientists expect that the drift toward Russia will continue to slow, though there is some uncertainty about how long the slowdown will persist and if it will continue at its current pace, according to Brown.\n\n\u201cIt could change (its) rate, or even speed up again,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the field and to assess the performance of the WMM, but we do not anticipate needing to release a new model before the planned update in 2030.\u201d\n\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field has behaved even more dramatically in the past, with the magnetosphere weakening so much that its polarity reversed. This flips the magnetic north and south poles, and the change can last for tens of thousands of years. Scientists have estimated that this polar flip, which can take thousands of years to complete, happens about once every million years, though the time between flips has varied greatly \u2014 from 5,000 years to as much as 50 million years. The signs that precede such flips are also not well understood, making them difficult to predict, Brown said. The last big flip was about 750,000 to 780,000 years ago.\n\nDuring a polar flip, animals that migrate using the magnetic field to find their way, such as whales, butterflies, sea turtles and many species of migratory birds, could be affected.

                "title": "1 in 12 children are victims of online sexual abuse, study says",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nResearchers are calling for global action after finding that 1 in 12 kids are being exposed to sexual exploitation and abuse online, according to a new study.\n\n\u201cThe study highlights the urgent need for increased awareness and action from the public and policymakers. Rapid advancements in digital technology and the growth of internet and smartphone access, particularly in developing nations, are putting more children at risk every day,\u201d said lead author of the study Dr. Xiangming Fang, research associate professor of health policy and behavioral sciences at Georgia State University\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nThe report published Tuesday in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health looked at data from 123 studies between 2010 and 2023. Researchers then analyzed the number of children younger than 18 years old who were exposed to any of the subtypes of sexual abuse: online solicitation; online sexual exploitation; sexual extortion; and nonconsensual taking and sharing of and exposure to sexual images and videos.\n\nLast year, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and Homeland Security Investigations received more than 36 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation of children, \u201cto say nothing of the untold number of cases that are never reported,\u201d said Kate Kennedy, director of the Know2Protect campaign of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cThe internet has become a crime scene, with children sexually exploited and abused online about ten times every second. It\u2019s a global health emergency linked to poorer mental and physical health, reduced employment prospects and lower life expectancy,\u201d Fang said in an email.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s preventable, not inevitable. Online (child sexual abuse) is more prevalent than other major childhood public health problems like asthma, obesity and ADHD \u2014 and we can protect children if we treat it in a similar way, as a public health problem with a focus on prevention.\u201d\n\nThe online crime scene\n\nKnowing what sexual abuse and exploitation online looks like can help in its prevention.\n\nThe researchers defined online sexual exploitation as sex acts being exchanged for money or resources. Those can be \u201cfood, clothes, shelter, affection, protection, belonging, gifts, or anything else of perceived value to the young person or child,\u201d Fang said.\n\nOnline solicitation is sexual inquiries and long-term sexual conversations, which may lead to exchanging sexual pictures or videos, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the different types of online solicitation often come from peers as well as adult perpetrators,\u201d Fang added.\n\nSexual extortion happens when a person blackmails another person for things including money, gift cards or other sexual acts by threatening to share intimate pictures or videos, according to the study.\n\nAnd nonconsensual taking, sharing and exposure to sexual images can happen when images are captured when a child was intoxicated, distracted, unconscious or otherwise unable to consent, he said. Exploitation and abuse can also occur when a child\u2019s face is imposed onto a sexual image of someone else (called a \u201cdeepfake\u201d) or when a child is exposed to pornographic content.\n\n\u201cUnwanted exposure to sexual content also occurs frequently while surfing or scrolling through social media,\u201d Fang said.\n\nThe use of AI-generated images, deepfakes and other technological advances has encouraged the rise of sexual extortion, exploitation and abuse, he said.\n\n\u201cBe in no doubt (these) are not harmless images: they are deeply damaging, and the abuse continues with every view and the failure to take down this abusive content,\u201d Fang added.\n\nWhere to turn\n\nTalking to children about their safety online is a crucial first step in protecting them from online sexual abuse, said Dr. Kara Alaimo, associate professor of communication at Fairleigh Dickinson University. She was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cKids are likely at greater risk of becoming victims if they aren\u2019t educated about these dangers and how to protect themselves online, spend a lot of time online, and are unsupervised online,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen it comes to supervision, there are ways to keep an eye on your child\u2019s safety while still allowing them some privacy, including a new feature on Instagram that gives parents access to who their child is communicating with while not sharing the content of the messages, said Alaimo, who is also the author of \u201cOver the Influence: Why Social Media Is Toxic for Women and Girls \u2014 And How We Can Take It Back.\u201d\n\nKeep conversations about what\u2019s going on online open with your children and limit their screen time so that they have other healthy things to do, such as going outside and spending time with their friends face to face, Alaimo said.\n\nIt\u2019s also vital for families to let children know \u201cthat if they are targeted that they can always turn to them for support and to find a way out,\u201d said first author of the study Dr. Deborah Fry, professor of international child protection research at the University of Edinburgh and global director of data for Childlight \u2013 Global Child Safety Institute.\n\nAnd know that there are resources for you, too, if you find your child has been the victim of online sexual abuse, Alaimo added.\n\n\u201cIf kids do become victims of online abuse,\u201d she said, \u201cparents should consider reaching out to law enforcement, groups such as the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) and an attorney.\u201d",

He\u2019s gone, he\u2019s made it,\u2019\u201d Thirlwall said. \u201cThen I made it [as a member of Little Mix] the next year and then I saw him in a room after and he was like, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry that I ignored you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe laughed when Theroux noted that Styles had \u201cghosted\u201d her.\n\n\u201cBut, again, I was so young that it didn\u2019t really matter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he was always very, very lovely.\u201d\n\nThirlwall, now a solo artist, didn\u2019t stop there with the praise of Styles, adding that he has \u201cgotten himself where he is because he\u2019s very talented\u201d before once again reiterating that \u201cHe\u2019s very lovely, very charming.\u201d\n\nLittle Mix went on hiatus in 2022.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJustin Baldoni\u2019s legal team on Tuesday released footage from the set of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d the film at the center of his ongoing legal battle with co-star Blake Lively, that they say supports his claim that he acted with \u201crespect and professionalism\u201d toward the former \u201cGossip Girl\u201d star, who has accused him of sexual harassment.\n\nThe video released is nearly 10 minutes of footage during which Lively and Baldoni are seen filming for a slow dance montage that is referenced in both Lively\u2019s initial complaint with the California Civil Rights Department and a later lawsuit, in which she cited specific instances of what she characterized as inappropriate behavior by Baldoni.\n\nLively claimed in her December 31 sexual harassment lawsuit against Baldoni that he \u201cleaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, \u2018it smells so good,\u2019\u201d a comment the complaint described as not \u201cremotely in character, or based on any dialogue in the script.\u201d\n\nHer suit alleged that during the filming of the montage, \u201cnothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound\u201d and that Baldoni was \u201ccaressing Ms. Lively with his mouth in a way that had nothing to do with their roles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe following videos captured on May 23, 2023 clearly refute Ms. Lively\u2019s characterization of his behavior,\u201d a statement that precedes the footage provided by Baldoni\u2019s lawyer this week said. \u201cThe scene in question was designed to show the two characters falling in love and longing to be close to one another. Both actors are clearly behaving well within the scope of the scene and with mutual respect and professionalism.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Lively and Baldoni are seen slow dancing on a busy set with extras surrounding them. They can be heard speaking to each other about how to portray the intimate parts of the scene, with Lively telling Baldoni she thinks it\u2019s more \u201cromantic\u201d for them to appear to be talking instead of kissing.\n\nAt one point in the video, Baldoni leans in to Lively and asks, \u201cAm I getting beard on you today?\u201d After Lively laughs and says, \u201cI\u2019m probably getting spray-tan on you,\u201d Baldoni replies that \u201cit smells good.\u201d\n\nThe video footage shows three takes of the same scene, but it is unclear how much, if any, footage was filmed that is not included in the clip that Baldoni\u2019s lawyer released. It is also unclear how long Lively and Baldoni were present together on set that day.\n\nIn addition to costarring in the film, Baldoni served as director as well as producer through his own company Wayfarer Studios, which financed the film and has access to all footage from it.\n\nLively\u2019s team released a statement upon the video\u2019s release on Tuesday, saying in part that \u201cevery frame of the released footage corroborates, to the letter, what Ms. Lively described in Paragraph 48 of her Complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively\u2019s discomfort. They will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent,\u201d her statement continued.\n\nBaldoni and Lively have been in a legal battle that began on December 21 when Lively filed her complaint that preceded her civil sexual harassment lawsuit. In her suit, Lively said that during the filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d a meeting was held to address a \u201chostile work environment that had nearly derailed production\u201d and that she had raised concerns about \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Mr. Baldoni.\u201d\n\nLively\u2019s suit also alleges that Baldoni\u2019s PR representatives orchestrated a \u201csocial manipulation\u201d campaign intended to hurt her reputation in the media in retaliation for raising concerns about his on-set behavior.\n\nBaldoni has denied Lively\u2019s allegations and filed a $250 million libel suit against The New York Times on December 31, claiming that the newspaper \u2013 who first reported Lively\u2019s civil rights complaint \u2013 published an accompanying article that was \u201crife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions\u201d that relied on Lively\u2019s \u201cself-serving narrative.\u201d\n\nBaldoni\u2019s legal representation said Tuesday that they have plans to set up a website that contains more correspondence and video footage that will discredit Lively\u2019s claims.\n\nBaldoni also filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and her publicist Leslie Sloane on January 16.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nTwo new 591-foot-tall skyscrapers, linked across the top by a daring \u201csky pool,\u201d are set to rise above Dubai\u2019s Marasi Marina.\n\nBut the soaring 43-foot infinity pool will not be accessible to the public, or even to most of the luxury towers\u2019 residents \u2014 it\u2019s part of what its architects describe as an exclusive \u201cultra-penthouse.\u201d\n\nComprising 63 luxury residences, the new Regent Residences Dubai will be worth an estimated $1 billion upon its completion in 2027. The 35,000-square-foot penthouse features six bedrooms, a gym and a private elevator.\n\nDesigned by British architect Norman Foster's firm, Foster + Partners, the project will soar above Dubai's Marasi Marina. Foster + Partners\n\nThe project\u2019s other apartments, which all measure upwards of 6,500 square feet, will each occupy an entire floor. They were orientated to offer views of the marina and the nearby Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building.\n\nAnd residents need not worry about missing out on the \u201csky pool\u201d: All the apartments contain their own private swimming terraces (and access to another 82-foot indoor lap pool).\n\nA series of newly released renderings show the staggered pool terraces jutting out from the two towers\u2019 facades. The design was \u201cinspired by cascading water,\u201d according to Foster + Partners, the architecture firm behind the project.\n\nReal estate company Sankari (which developed the project alongside IHG Hotels & Resorts) declined to disclose to CNN how much the \u201cultra-penthouse\u201d will cost, though the other residences start at $10 million each. Advertised as the \u201cjewel in Dubai\u2019s crown,\u201d the luxury development also features 10 floating homes dubbed \u201cwater villas.\u201d\n\nEach apartment will occupy an entire floor and comes with its own private swimming terrace. Foster + Partners\n\nResidents will enjoy access to tennis and padel courts, outdoor lounges, a private cinema and virtual golf simulator, among much else. The podium at the base of the towers will meanwhile feature open green spaces, restaurants and retail space.\n\nThe project is part of a major overhaul of the waterfront Marasi Marina neighborhood in Business Bay, a new high-rise development on the Dubai Creek, south of the city\u2019s downtown area. It is Regent Residences\u2019 first property in the Middle East.\n\nThe two towers are not identical though they share \u201csame design language,\u201d according to Foster + Partners. In a press statement, the firm\u2019s studio head Gerard Evenden said the project\u2019s \u201cdynamic twisting form and articulated facade\u201d will make it \u201ca distinctive new addition\u201d to Dubai.\n\nThe luxury residence is due to complete in 2027. Foster + Partners\n\nFoster + Partners, which was founded by the celebrated architect \u2014 and winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession\u2019s equivalent to a Nobel \u2014 Norman Foster, has designed numerous other high-profile buildings in the United Arab Emirates in recent years. Among them are an 80-story Dubai skyscraper, called The Index, and the House of Wisdom, a library and culture center in Sharjah. The firm\u2019s sculptural Zayed National Museum, which will serve as the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi\u2019s new Saadiyat Island Cultural District, is due to open later this year.\n\nIt is not the first time a swimming pool has been suspended between buildings: London\u2019s see-through Sky Pool, built across the 10th stories of two residential towers, opened in the British capital\u2019s Nine Elms neighborhood in 2021.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLanding on the moon is one of the most challenging things humanity has attempted. Perhaps that\u2019s part of what drives us to keep trying.\n\nYears before astronauts are set to return to the lunar surface, a stream of robotic explorers are carrying the ambitions of private companies aiming for a moon landing.\n\nFor Intuitive Machines, 2025 presents a second chance at perfection after its Odysseus spacecraft touched down on the moon in February 2024 but ultimately tipped over.\n\nNo matter the outcome of that company\u2019s upcoming mission and a host of other lunar pursuits, 2025 promises to be an exciting year for the latest leg of the new moon race.\n\nFirefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander aims to carry 10 NASA tech demos and scientific instruments to the moon. Firefly Aerospace/NASA\n\nTwo different lunar missions lifted off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket this week, each with its own trek and purpose as they head for the silvery orb.\n\nTexas-based Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost mission, featuring the company\u2019s first lunar lander, is on its way to an ancient volcanic structure with a Lunar PlanetVac to collect soil samples.\n\nMeanwhile, Tokyo-based Ispace sent Resilience, an improved version of the Hakuto-R spacecraft that crash-landed on the moon in 2023. A mini rover is on board, as well as a tiny red artwork called \u201cMoonhouse,\u201d among other items.\n\nBlue Ghost is expected to attempt a landing on March 2, while Resilience will conserve energy and take four to five months to reach its target.\n\nDefying gravity\n\nAfter a few starts and stops, Jeff Bezos\u2019 company Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn rocket to space for the first time on Thursday. The rocket, which could be a contender against rival SpaceX, carried a tech demo for Blue Ring, a spacecraft designed to tow satellites deeper into space.\n\nLater the same day, SpaceX\u2019s Starship launched its most ambitious test flight yet. The company was able to catch the rocket booster as it returned to Earth. But the Starship spacecraft itself exploded, and the debris diverted flights over the Caribbean. The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded Starship as it investigates reports of property damage in Turks and Caicos.\n\nAnd India became the fourth country to ace an uncrewed docking between two small crafts, called Target and Chaser, in space. Such an achievement is critical if the country wishes to build its own space station and put an Indian astronaut on the moon.\n\nOcean secrets\n\nA heavily pregnant male Denise's pygmy seahorse is seen on his way to give birth in the waters off the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Richard Smith/OceanRealmImages.com\n\nFingernail-size pygmy seahorses are some of the smallest vertebrates on the planet, but British marine biologist Richard Smith makes their colorful world seem larger than life.\n\nSmith began studying the elusive creatures in the early 2000s. Seahorses are known to mate for life. But he uncovered that a species of pygmy seahorse found off the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is polygamous.\n\nHe dived for hours a day to observe a female he nicknamed Josephine who had three male suitors.\n\nSeahorses are one of the only animals in which the male carries eggs, deposited by the female, and then gives birth. Smith\u2019s photos, showcased in a new book, even captured the stretch marks of one of the male seahorses that carried Josephine\u2019s babies for her.\n\nTrailblazers\n\nRoyal Navy surgeon James Lind discovered the cure for scurvy when he tested treatments in 1747 among a group of 12 sailors in an experiment regarded as the first controlled clinical trial of the modern age.\n\nBut he might have been inspired by a little-known instrument maker named Francis Hauksbee the Younger, the nephew of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s laboratory assistant.\n\nJust four years before the scurvy study, Hauksbee wrote a proposal that laid out an approach for carrying out a controlled trial that included 12 participants and considered their diets and long-term clinical outcomes. And when modern researchers compared the designs for Lind\u2019s and Hauksbee\u2019s studies, they uncovered a pattern.\n\nBack to the future\n\nA dodo skeleton is seen in 1938 opposite a reconstructed model of the extinct bird in the National Museum Cardiff in Wales. Becker/Fox Photos/Getty Images\n\nBiotech company Colossal Biosciences\u2019 plans to create approximations of extinct creatures such as the woolly mammoth, dodo and Tasmanian tiger within the next decade make it seem as though de-extinction is possible in our lifetime.\n\nGenetics and old-fashioned breeding have already been used by Netherlands-based Grazelands Rewilding to bring about herds of tauros cattle, the modern-day equivalent of the aurochs, an ox depicted in prehistoric cave paintings.\n\nColossal Biosciences has raised millions in funds thanks to high-profile investors including athletes and celebrities. But there are numerous challenges and concerns associated with reviving animals lost to time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not de-extinction, it\u2019s genetically engineering a novel organism to fulfill the functions, theoretically, of an extant (living) organism,\u201d said Melanie Challenger, deputy co-chair of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the United Kingdom. \u201cAnd all the way through the process, there are different, quite gnarly ethical considerations.\u201d\n\nDiscoveries\n\nThese intriguing stories may inspire a curiosity voyage:\n\n\u2014 Scientists are undertaking a new project to better understand \u201cdark\u201d oxygen, apparently produced by potato-size metallic rocks on the seabed. The endeavor could help reveal life beyond Earth.\n\n\u2014 A moon rover-inspired robot named Adam that can shuttle heavy produce across difficult terrain and cut grass could be a game changer for Japan\u2019s aging farmers.\n\n\u2014 Researchers newly identified a \u201csupergiant\u201d crustacean, with a head that resembles the helmet of Darth Vader from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, near the coast of Vietnam.\n\nLike what you\u2019ve read?

                "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA startling discovery made public in July that metallic rocks were apparently producing oxygen on the Pacific Ocean\u2019s seabed, where no light can penetrate, was a scientific bombshell.\n\nInitial research suggested potato-size nodules rich in metals, predominantly found 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) below the surface in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, released an electrical charge, splitting seawater into oxygen and hydrogen through electrolysis. The unprecedented natural phenomenon challenges the idea that oxygen can only be made from sunlight via photosynthesis.\n\nAndrew Sweetman, a professor at the UK\u2019s Scottish Association for Marine Science who was behind the find, is embarking on a three-year project to investigate the production of \u201cdark\u201d oxygen further. Sweetman and his team are using custom-made rigs equipped with sensors that can be deployed to depths of 11,000 meters (36,089 feet). The Nippon Foundation is funding the $2.7 million (2.2 million-pound) research project, which was announced Friday.\n\nThe Nippon Foundation and Scottish Association for Marine Science announce the launch of a research project at a news briefing in Scotland House.

Alex Rumford/SAMS/The Nippon Foundation\n\nUncovering dark oxygen revealed just how little is known about the deep ocean, and the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ, in particular. The region is being explored for the deep-sea mining of rare metals contained in the rock nodules. The latter are formed over millions of years, and the metals play a key role in new and green technologies.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d Sweetman, the leader of his institution\u2019s seafloor ecology and biogeochemistry group, said in a news release. \u201cThis new research will enable us to probe some of these scientific questions.\u201d\n\nSweetman said the initial goal of the new project was to determine whether dark oxygen production was replicated in other areas of the CCZ where the nodules can be found and then untangle exactly how the oxygen was being produced.\n\nUnderstanding the phenomenon better could also help space scientists find life beyond Earth, he added.\n\nOxygen in unexpected places\n\nOxygen is hard to produce without the continuous energy that comes from sunlight, but other scientists have also encountered unexpected oxygen molecules in remote, light-deprived places. Sweetman said that dark oxygen production may be a wider phenomenon that has been overlooked.\n\nEmil Ruff, a microbiologist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, detected oxygen in freshwater samples in Alberta tens to hundreds of meters beneath the Canadian prairie, a finding he and coauthors from the University of Calgary and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution reported in a study published in June 2023. In some cases, the dark oxygen had been isolated from the atmosphere aboveground for more than 40,000 years.\n\nIf oxygen is not continuously being added to an environment (by trees and plants, for example), it would eventually disappear.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left. Because oxygen is such a yummy electron acceptor, it usually either chemically oxidizes or microbially oxidizes,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cSo what was it doing there?\u201d\n\nSimilar to Sweetman, Ruff said he first thought atmospheric oxygen had contaminated his samples, which were drawn from 14 groundwater aquifers. Given the age of the samples, any oxygen would have reacted with other substances long ago and disappeared.\n\nAfter patiently working in the lab and field, Ruff ultimately discovered that microbes in the water were producing oxygen. The microbes had apparently evolved an obscure but neat trick that allowed them to produce molecules in the absence of light.\n\nThrough a series of chemical reactions, the microbes were able to break down soluble compounds called nitrites, molecules made of one nitrogen and two oxygen atoms, to produce molecular oxygen in a process known as dismutation. The microbes also had the ability to use the oxygen to consume methane in the water for energy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\n\u201cNature keeps surprising us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many things that people have said, \u2018Oh, this is impossible,\u2019 and then later it turns out it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nTo investigate dark oxygen further, Ruff and his team traveled to a 3-kilometer-deep (9,500-foot-deep) mine in South Africa in August to sample water that had been trapped in the rock for 1.2 billion years.\n\nA team of scientists hunt for microbes at a study site in a 3-kilometer-deep (9,500-foot-deep) mine in South Africa. The researchers study brines isolated in the rock for 1.2 billion years that are teeming with life and are investigating how oxygen is produced in this ancient ecosystem. Taro KIDO\n\nScientists already knew the water in the mine contained oxygen molecules, but it\u2019s unclear how they were formed. Ruff and his colleagues are still studying the samples they took, but they have two hypotheses as to how oxygen molecules might be produced, he said.\n\nThe site is mined for gold and uranium, a radioactive metal. Radiolysis, the splitting of water molecules through radioactivity, is one of the possible ways oxygen is produced without sunlight. Alternatively, the production of oxygen could involve microbes in processes similar to those Ruff found in Canada\u2019s groundwater.\n\nSweetman said on Friday the new project would also seek to understand whether any micriobial reactions played a role in dark oxygen production on the seafloor. In particular, the project will look into how hydrogen is released during the production of oxygen by the metallic nodules and whether hydrogen was used as an energy source for communities of microbes detected in parts of the deep ocean.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the mechanism, I think, completely wrapped up yet and we\u2019ll need a lot of time to figure that out,\u201d he said.\n\nRuff said he hoped to collaborate with Sweetman and other scientists involved in the dark oxygen research to understand how the chemical signature of the oxygen produced by seawater electrolysis differed from that produced by microbes or radiolysis.\n\nDark oxygen and the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nOfficials at NASA are interested in the research on dark oxygen production because it could inform scientific understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight, Sweetman said.\n\nThe space agency wants to run experiments to understand the amount of energy required to potentially produce oxygen at higher pressures that occur on Enceladus and Europa, the icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter, respectively, he added. Those moons are among the targets for investigating the possibility of life.\n\nRelicanthus sp. is a newfound species collected at 4,100 meters (13,450 feet) in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. It lives on sponge stalks attached to polymetallic nodules that are of interest to the mining industry. Craig Smith and Diva Amon, ABYSSLINE Project; NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research\n\nDeep-sea mining companies are aiming to mine the cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and manganese contained in the nodules for use in solar panels, electric car batteries and other green technology. Some companies have taken issue with Sweetman\u2019s research.\n\nCritics say deep-sea mining could irrevocably damage the pristine underwater environment and that it could disrupt the way carbon is stored in the ocean, contributing to the climate crisis.\n\nThe Metals Co. said it had submitted a rebuttal to Nature Geoscience, the journal that published the original research. The submission was undergoing peer review but has not been published yet, the company said.\n\nSweetman said he was aware of the critical reaction and would respond \u201cthrough peer-reviewed channels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are completely convinced that this is an actual process going on at the seafloor,\u201d he said.\n\nSweetman also said it was prudent to hold off exploiting resources on the seabed until the ecosystem was better understood.\n\nAmy Gartman, a research oceanographer and global marine minerals project chief at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far. She was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cResearchers are currently trying to replicate the phenomena reported by Sweetman and others,\u201d she said. \u201cScientific research is a process and it may be some time before a conclusive answer is reached.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJapan\u2019s population is the oldest in the world, with a third aged over 65, and one in 10 aged over 80, due to a combination of low fertility rates and high life expectancy.\n\nThis has a direct effect on its working-age population \u2014 the share of 15 to 64 year-olds \u2014 which is projected to shrink by 30 million people between 2020 and 2070.\n\nAgriculture is particularly hit by the problem: according to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the number of people mainly employed in farming halved between 2000 and 2023, and those aged under 60 only make up about 20% of the total.\n\nTo combat this shortage, along with a more relaxed stance on immigration and fertility policies, the country is increasingly looking at robotics to supplement the workforce.\n\nTamir Blum founded Kisui Tech while still a student, in 2021 \u2014 a company that is using technology from space exploration to build an AI-assisted farming robot. \u201cIn the past 20 years or so, 50% of the farmers have retired, meaning that there\u2019s more and more burden on fewer and fewer farmers to keep producing a stable food supply,\u201d he says.\n\nKisui Tech's robot \"Adam,\" and founder Tamir Blum. CNN\n\nThe semi-autonomous robot is called Adam and is able to carry picked produce across difficult terrain as well as cut grass and spray fields with pesticides. Blum, an Israeli-American who first visited Japan in 2015, returned to the country in 2018 for a PhD during which he researched lunar rovers and their ability to navigate bumpy and uneven terrain.\n\n\u201cDuring that PhD program, I traveled a lot around the Japanese countryside,\u201d he says, \u201cYou can tell how much difficulty (it) is having with the labor shortage. You see many abandoned houses \u2026 The farmers are clearly getting older \u2026 I realized how difficult it was, and also the great potential for this type of off-road robotics technology to be applied, especially for outdoor orchards, which are also very, very bumpy \u2014 similar to what I was researching for space robotics.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This robot could be the future of farming in Japan 00:57 - Source: CNN This robot could be the future of farming in Japan 00:57\n\nKisui Tech is working with the Center for Environment, Health and Field Sciences at\n\nChiba University, near Tokyo, in developing two models of Adam \u2014 a full-size and a mini version \u2014 and testing them in real-life scenarios on farms around Japan.\n\nThe larger Adam is 70 centimeters high and 188 centimeters in length, and is aimed primarily at apple and pear farmers, with a large truckbed to carry produce or fertilizer. The smaller Adam, about one third of the size, is targeting grape and persimmon farms, which are planted in narrower rows. Alongside the robots, Kisui is also developing an online platform called Newton, which gives farmers real-time insights into crops, diseases, and farm management. Adam is expected to retail for around $20,000 on international markets.\n\nKisui Tech\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really amazed by the reaction of the farmers,\u201d says Blum, \u201cbecause in Japan, I think most people would have a stereotype that farmers are very traditional: they don\u2019t like technology, they\u2019re not willing to try new things. However \u2026 they\u2019ve been very receptive, very willing to give advice, very willing to try Adam.\u201d\n\nAdam is approaching commercial release and has been radically transformed from early versions based on feedback from the farmers. For example, a touchscreen was replaced by a panel with physical buttons, because farmers often wear gloves, which don\u2019t work well with touchscreens.\n\nKisui recently completed its first paid proof of concept to automate patrol and data collection at a solar plant for a Japanese power company. Blum says it has also received requests from the construction industry, looking to use the robot for patrols, security and transporting heavy goods.\n\n\u201cWe see Adam as a tool, not just for farming, but basically all outdoor work,\u201d says Blum.\n\nThe story has been updated to correct the name of the department at Chiba University working with Kisui Tech.",

                "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe first controlled clinical trial recorded in the modern age, carried out in 1747 to test treatments for scurvy, may have drawn inspiration from the nephew of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s laboratory assistant, according to new research.\n\nToday, clinical trials are an essential part of medical research that can lead to crucial advances, but this type of systematic study comparing treatments to assess which is most effective hasn\u2019t always been standard scientific protocol.\n\nThings changed when Royal Navy surgeon James Lind set out to see what could be used to treat scurvy, the scourge of sailors for thousands of years.\n\nBut a new analysis of an 18th century study by Francis Hauksbee the Younger just four years before Lind\u2019s controlled trial suggests that Hauksbee laid out an approach to how one should execute a controlled trial. The design of his study likely sparked Lind\u2019s pivotal research that identified oranges and lemons (and ultimately, vitamin C) as a cure for scurvy.\n\nThe new paper, published January 7 in Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science, sheds light on early clinical trials that pushed for a more critical, open-minded approach to testing medicine, as well as how such trials have evolved over time.\n\n\u201cWhen one examines old medical books it is common to read claims from doctors that their own treatments can cure every disease under the sun and without any side effects, despite often using chemicals like mercury,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Max Cooper, senior lecturer in primary care and public health at England\u2019s Brighton and Sussex Medical School, in an email. \u201cWhen stumbling upon Hauksbee\u2019s writing, I was immediately struck by his scientific open mindedness in calling for evidence both \u2018for and against\u2019 his drug. To say that about one\u2019s own medication was very unusual.\u201d\n\nDesigning a \u2018decisive experiment\u2019\n\nHauksbee isn\u2019t a well-known figure from history, and even when he was alive, he was confused with his namesake and uncle, Francis Hauksbee the Elder, who served as an inventive lab assistant for Newton, the polymath and pioneering scientist, at the Royal Society, the United Kingdom\u2019s national academy of sciences.\n\nHauksbee the Younger was an instrument maker and science lecturer who became the society\u2019s housekeeper and clerk. And while he was never a physician himself, he created a new medicine for genital discharge, referred to in his study as venereal disease.\n\nThe London medical community wouldn\u2019t consider Hauksbee\u2019s treatment, or support the prescription of his treatment, largely because he wasn\u2019t a physician, Cooper said. Instead, Hauksbee was hit with allegations of \u201cquackery.\u201d\n\nIn the 18th century, for many physicians who typically formulated their own medicines, it would have been highly unusual to prescribe someone else\u2019s treatment, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cBecause patients were paying physicians directly for their services, treatment choice was (personalized) to the individual,\u201d Cooper said in an email. \u201cProfessional reputation was key for sustaining physicians\u2019 livelihood. In essence, money and reputation came ahead of making a fair comparison of different treatments.\u201d\n\nHauksbee set out to compare different drug treatments for venereal disease, including his own medication, in a proposal he called \u201cExperimentum Crucis,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cdecisive experiment.\u201d Hauksbee wrote that he himself had been inspired by the methods of English physician James Jurin, who in the 1720s published outcomes of inoculating people against smallpox, a precursor to smallpox vaccination.\n\nWhen Hauksbee's request to have other physicians prescribe his treatment was not accepted, he wrote a proposal for a controlled clinical trial that would compare the results of patients taking his medication with patients who were prescribed treatments elsewhere. Francis Hauksbee\n\nJurin compiled reports from those who were inoculated, then calculated the risk of dying from the practice, said Dr. Andrea Rusnock, a professor in the department of history at the University of Rhode Island. Rusnock was not involved in the new research. Jurin then compared the level of risk with the larger risk of dying from contracting actual smallpox and found that inoculation was safer.\n\nHauksbee laid out a practical 10-step approach to the research. The study proposal called for 12 patients. Half of the participants would receive Hauksbee\u2019s medication, while the others would receive treatments from other doctors, Cooper said.\n\nHauksbee wanted to record the outcomes of the patients and have them independently assessed, and then share the findings for all 12 patients with the public. He also believed it was important to focus on a \u201clasting cure\u201d by following the patients\u2019 long-term clinical outcomes, Cooper said. Additionally, Hauksbee\u2019s proposal considers the patients\u2019 diets and accommodations throughout the study.\n\n\u201cThe key similarity with modern drug trials lies in the fundamental importance of comparing one treatment against another,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBefore people like Hauksbee and Lind, most drug \u2018trials\u2019 simply involved giving the treatment to as many patients as possible and seeing what happened. The lesson of Hauksbee and Lind is the need for a comparison of treatments that is as fair as possible.\u201d\n\nSeeking a solution to scurvy\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Hauksbee\u2019s study ever took place, according to the new research.\n\nThe London medical faculty had no interest in pursuing such a study from a nonphysician, and at the time, it was thought best that patients with venereal disease \u201cshould refrain from public inspection,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nBut Hauksbee\u2019s study proposal was published in 1743, and it happened to be on a topic of Lind\u2019s interest: venereal disease. Lind wrote his doctor of medicine thesis in 1747 on the same topic, according to the new research. To do so, Lind must have read extensively on the subject, Cooper said.\n\nThen, Lind pursued his trial of scurvy treatments. On May 20, 1747, Lind assessed a dozen patients with scurvy aboard the Royal Navy ship HMS Salisbury while at sea. All 12 patients were in the same part of the ship and shared a common diet. He divided the patients up into six pairs and gave each a different treatment to see if \u201ccyder,\u201d vinegar, seawater, oranges and lemons, or an electuary (a medicine mixed with honey or syrup) could be effective against scurvy.\n\nAfter six days, Lind observed that the \u201cmost sudden and visible good effects were perceived from the use of the oranges and lemons.\u201d\n\nBoth Hauksbee\u2019s and Lind\u2019s studies included 12 participants and considered the patients\u2019 diet and accommodation, Cooper said.\n\nAlisha Rankin, department chair and professor of history at Tufts University, believes the new study \u201cadds to the substantial body of research conducted over the last decade revealing that healers were thinking about how to test drugs long before the modern period.\u201d Rankin was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cWhat I found particularly interesting in this article was the convincing theory that Hauksbee\u2019s trials served as a model for Lind,\u201d said Rankin, author of \u201cThe Poison Trials: Wonder Drugs, Experiment, and the Battle for Authority in Renaissance Science.\u201d \u201cIt shows that Lind\u2019s experiments were part of a broader conversation about testing medicines at the time, and it adds to the evidence that practitioners derided as \u2018quacks\u2019 actually had an enormous role in shaping experimental thinking in (those times).\u201d\n\nLike other nonphysicians and unlicensed healers, Hauksbee was trying to provide proof to sell his medication.\n\n\u201cHauksbee\u2019s pamphlet followed close on the heels of Parliament\u2019s investigation of Mrs. Joanna Stephens\u2019 cure for bladder stones in 1738-9,\u201d Rankin said in an email. \u201cA Parliament-appointed committee oversaw a (nearly) year-long trial on four test subjects, ultimately deemed successful, which earned Mrs. Stephens a prize of \u00a35,000! Hauksbee may have had reason to hope for greater support than he received. The examples of Stephens, Hauksbee, and Lind show an increasing interest in testing drugs for specific illnesses and conditions in the eighteenth century.\u201d\n\nLearning from the past\n\nHad Hauksbee been able to carry out his trial, he still would have faced scrutiny, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cToday we know that to show clear benefits of one treatment over another, nearly all drug trials need to include many more than Hauksbee\u2019s 12 participants,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhat is more, 18th century doctors attributed differences in the effects of treatments to patients\u2019 \u2018temperament\u2019 (personality type) \u2014 rather than to the drug. That all leads me to think that the trial would not have shown a big difference between treatments or that the doctors involved would have fallen out over how to interpret small differences between outcomes.\u201d\n\nHistoric trials like Hauksbee\u2019s design differ significantly from random clinical trials today, where participants are assigned randomly to different conditions after they voluntarily agree, with informed consent, Rusnock said.\n\n\u201cIn the eighteenth century, patients often did not have the choice to refuse participation or might not even know that they were in a trial,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile this trial was never conducted, it shows how the idea of comparing treatments in a methodical and documented manner was becoming more generally accepted.\u201d\n\nCooper was inspired to conduct the research because Lind is a hero of his and considers Lind\u2019s study to be a \u201cquantum leap in medical research\u201d \u2014 one likely spurred by ideas from Hauksbee and others. Understanding the foundations of clinical research can be a valuable teaching tool for the physicians of tomorrow, Cooper said.\n\n\u201cMy inspiration for studying Hauksbee lies in a fascination with the history of medicine and a belief that medical students can learn from the clinical advances and errors made by doctors over the centuries,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis is particularly true with regard to the history of the development of drug trials. I use examples like Hauksbee\u2019s study proposal to help medical students understand the strengths and weaknesses of treatment trials.\u201d",

An empty carriage on an otherwise packed train.\n\n\u201cWe thought this would be great, just the two of us. We spread out everything, so we could have a couch each to lie on,\u201d Nina tells CNN Travel today.\n\n\u201cThen, all of a sudden we hear this big \u2018thump, thump, thump,\u2019 on the door.\u201d\n\nIt was summer 1990 and 20-year-old Nina was in the midst of traveling from Budapest, Hungary, to Athens, Greece \u2014 part of a month-long rail adventure with her friend Loa.\n\nThe two friends had each bought a train ticket known as the Interrail or Eurail pass, allowing young travelers a period of unlimited rail travel around Europe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Swedish, I was working at Swedish Radio at the time, and had saved up money for going on my Interrail,\u201d says Nina. \u201cI wanted to see all of Europe.\u201d\n\nTraveling by train from Budapest to Athens was set to take about four days, weaving south through eastern Europe. In Belgrade \u2014 which was then part of the former Yugoslavia, but is now the capital of Serbia \u2014 the passengers had to switch trains.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when Nina and Loa grabbed the empty compartment for themselves and settled in, ready to enjoy the extra space. Then, the knocking at the door.\n\nThe two friends met each other\u2019s eyes. They both knew, in that moment, that their solitude was to be short-lived.\n\n\u201cAnd then behind the door we see three heads poking in,\u201d recalls Nina. \u201cIt was a Scotsman, an Englishman and an Irishman. It was like the start of a joke. And I thought, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe three men were friendly, apologetic, slightly out of breath. They explained they\u2019d fallen asleep on their last train, and almost missed this one \u2014 in fact, this train had started rolling out of the station but suddenly slowed down. The three stragglers had managed to hop on as the train ground to a halt.\n\nNina and Loa warmed to the Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman right away, and moved their bags to make space.\n\nThe three men were a similar age to Nina and Loa. Early 20s. All carrying large backpacks and battered train timetables. The English guy, Steve, was a chatty bricklayer from London. The Irish guy, Paul, was polite and serious.\n\nBut it was the Scottish guy, Derek from Glasgow, who really took Nina\u2019s attention. He\u2019d led the charge into the carriage \u2014 somehow assertive, apologetic and charming all at once.\n\n\u201cI quite like the idea that he was so forward, but not rude. He was almost boyish,\u201d Nina says. \u201cHe seemed different than the other two. He was interesting.\u201d\n\nBetween introductions being made, travel stories swapped, snacks being shared, it took a little while for the group to fully take in that the train still hadn\u2019t moved from Belgrade train station. It remained at a standstill, long after its scheduled departure time.\n\nEventually, word spread through the train to Nina\u2019s compartment: Yugoslavian train workers were on strike. This train was not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nNina could have worried about her travel plans going awry. About wasting precious time of her long-planned rail adventure.\n\nBut instead, she didn\u2019t care. All she focused on was Derek.\n\nBonding on a stalled train\n\nDerek and Nina, on the left, with other Interrailers in the summer of 1990. Derek and Nina Barclay\n\nIn 1990, Derek Barclay was 21 and studying to become a construction engineer. He\u2019d saved up money from an unglamorous summer job building a prison to buy an Interrail pass.\n\n\u201cThen, I dumped my bag at my mum\u2019s house and said, \u2018I\u2019m off to Europe.\u2019 She was horrified,\u201d Derek tells CNN Travel today.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to go from Casablanca to Istanbul. But I never went to either. Along the way I met Nina and I got distracted \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile Nina and Derek formally met for the first time on the stalled train in Belgrade, Derek had first spotted Nina on a busy station platform, some hours earlier, in Budapest.\n\nWhen he spotted her sitting on a bench, smiling and laughing with Loa, Derek was struck by Nina right away. For a moment, he imagined getting to know her, what she might be like. Where she might be from, where she might be going.\n\nBut then Derek had ended up on a different train. He\u2019d met and got chatting to Steve the Englishman and Paul the Irishman. The trio had shared a couple of beers, fallen asleep, and woken, with a start, in Belgrade, to a suddenly-empty carriage. That\u2019s when they panicked.\n\n\u201cWe woke up, and just ran down the railway line \u2014 because we\u2019re just about to miss this train to Athens \u2014 we jumped on the train as it was pulling away, and then it stopped,\u201d Derek tells CNN Travel today. \u201cApparently that\u2019s what they had to do to get the strike official.\u201d\n\nWhen Derek, Steve and Paul opened the door to Nina\u2019s carriage, Derek didn\u2019t immediately take Nina in, focusing instead on the near-empty compartment.\n\n\u201cTwo of them in there, this carriage for eight, they\u2019d spread stuff everywhere. It was obvious it was a ruse to try and get people not to go in. And we thought, \u2018We\u2019re not having any of that,\u2019\u201d says Derek, laughing. \u201cSo we squeezed in, and that was that.\u201d\n\nIt was only when he ended up sitting opposite Nina that Derek realized she was the woman he\u2019d noticed on the Budapest train platform.\n\nThen they got chatting, and didn\u2019t stop. They talked about a shared love of nature. About Derek being a member of Greenpeace. About Sweden and Scotland.\n\n\u201cA conversation about life and the future, deep stuff,\u201d is how Nina puts it.\n\nThroughout, they kept steady eye contact, smiling and laughing together.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Nina and Derek who were enjoying themselves on the stationary train.\n\n\u201cIt was loaded with Interrailers,\u201d recalls Nina. \u201cSo it was a good atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAnd as the hours rolled on, the conviviality on board didn\u2019t dampen. If anything, things only got jollier.\n\n\u201cEveryone was talking away, sharing stories, sharing food,\u201d says Nina, who recalls being shocked when she learned Derek\u2019s only available snacks were 10 cans of Heinz Baked Beans \u2014 a reluctant parting gift from his mother and little use on a train with no microwave in sight.\n\nShe fished out of her rucksack her own superior selection of food supplies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a gourmet, so we had loaded off with cheese, bread,\u201d says Nina, who shared her goods with Derek.\n\n\u201cI think that the way to a man\u2019s heart is through to his stomach, as they say,\u201d she adds, laughing.\n\nLosing each other\n\nNina and Derek\u2019s train remained stuck in Belgrade for two whole days.\n\nTheoretically, there was nothing stopping passengers getting off. But everyone on board was concerned that if they did, the train would suddenly leave without them.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t know when it was going to move again,\u201d says Nina.\n\nBy the time the train departed the platform \u2014 to excited cheers from the passengers \u2014 Nina and Derek felt like they knew almost everything about one another.\n\n\u201cThey were really deep conversations. We really got to know each other,\u201d says Nina. \u201cWe were sharing stories and found we had similar interests.\u201d\n\nDerek particularly enjoyed hearing about Nina\u2019s job as a sound engineer, and she was intrigued that he shared a hometown with Glaswegian bands Simple Minds and The Blue Nile.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of traveling smoothly through the Serbian countryside, the train approached the Greek border and started to slow down.\n\nThen, suddenly, the passengers were ordered to disembark. It seemed the train chaos wasn\u2019t over, after all.\n\n\u201cIt was quite scary, because I remember it was very dark, and we had no information,\u201d recalls Nina. \u201cWe were just chucked off this train towards a bus station.\u201d\n\nAt the bus station, travelers \u201chad to fight for space on a replacement bus,\u201d as Derek recalls. They didn\u2019t know why this was happening.\n\n\u201cBy that point the five of us had bonded as a group and fought together,\u201d he adds.\n\nEventually, the rail replacement bus reached Athens, Greece. From there, Nina and Loa were heading on to the Greek island of Aegina, where they were set to meet up with some other Swedish friends.\n\nWith a ferry to catch, Nina and Loa said a quick goodbye to Derek, Paul and Steve. Nina felt a little flicker of sadness at the idea of not seeing Derek again, at their conversation of the last few days finally coming to an end.\n\nDerek also surprised himself by feeling sad.\n\n\u201cInterrailing, you meet new people for a day or two, three or four times a week,\u201d he points out.\n\nHe\u2019d adapted to other Interrailers appearing and disappearing from his life. But saying goodbye to Nina felt different.\n\nBut Derek, Steve and Paul had no pre-arranged commitments in Greece. And now Aegina was on their radar. After a day of strolling a little listlessly around Athens, the three guys decided to head to Aegina too \u2014 none of them quite admitting they were hoping to see Nina and Loa again.\n\nReuniting in Greece\n\nTwo days later, Nina, Loa and their other Swedish friends were spending a day swimming, sunbathing and relaxing on one of Aegina\u2019s sandy beaches.\n\n\u201cThen we can see these three peely-wally boys coming towards us,\u201d recalls Nina, using Scottish slang for \u201cpale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey looked kind of familiar. We thought they must be British, because they had no suntan yet. And sure enough, they were these three guys from the train.\u201d\n\nNina couldn\u2019t believe it. Loa was equally gobsmacked.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018All the islands in Greece. How could you find us?\u2019\u201d says Nina\n\nIt was immediately obvious that Derek, Steve and Paul ending up in Aegina wasn\u2019t a coincidence.\n\n\u201cWe got kind of a feeling they kind of liked our company,\u201d says Nina.\n\n\u201cWe found the five girls sunbathing topless,\u201d adds Derek. \u201cThey were quite surprised.\u201d\n\nOver the next couple of days, Nina and her friends explored Aegina, accompanied by Derek, Paul and Steve.\n\nThe easy, free flowing conversation between Nina and Derek was quickly rekindled.\n\nTheir bond on the train was to all intents and purposes \u201cjust being friendly, just getting to know each other a little bit,\u201d as Nina puts it.\n\n\u201cBut once we were in Greece, I started to feel more,\u201d she says.\n\nIt helped that they weren\u2019t stuck on a stuffy train anymore, rationing cheese and bread. Nina and Derek were spending their days sunbathing and enjoying sunkissed, beautiful Aegina.\n\n\u201cSwimming, eating and trips to a cheap bar\u2026\u201d recalls Derek.\n\nOne evening, Derek and Nina went for a midnight swim, just the two of them, and shared their first kiss.\n\nBut all too soon, their time in Greece drew to a close.\n\n\u201cWe went back home, me going to Sweden, Derek back to Scotland,\u201d says Nina. \u201cAnd I had never taken his address or phone number, nothing.\u201d\n\nSending letters\n\nNina had left Greece feeling grateful for a \u201cnice few days\u201d with Derek, assuming the connection wouldn\u2019t go any further.\n\n\u201cBut one of my friends thought that she saw some sparks between us,\u201d says Nina. \u201cSo she had asked Derek for his address on my behalf.\u201d\n\nOnce they were back in Sweden, this friend asked Nina if she regretted not taking Derek\u2019s details.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was a shame I didn\u2019t do that,\u201d replied Nina, slightly regretfully.\n\nShe\u2019d spent the days following her return to Sweden putting together a scrapbook chronicling her Interrailing adventure \u2014 sticking in ticket stubs, writing down favorite memories. She\u2019d realized many of these memories involved Derek.\n\nAnd so when Nina\u2019s friend revealed she\u2019d taken Derek\u2019s address on her behalf, Nina decided to send a postcard to Scotland.\n\n\u201cJust to say, \u2018I\u2019m back, I hope you\u2019ve had a nice journey back home,\u2019\u201d says Nina. \u201cI thought, \u2018If he\u2019s interested, I should hear back.\u2019 \u201cI knew it took about four days for a postcard to arrive, and it should take four days for a reply, if I get one.\n\nI thought, \u2018If I haven\u2019t heard anything in two weeks, then I won\u2019t hear from him at all.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter she mailed the postcard, Nina tried to avoid counting the days.\n\nBut right on cue, eight days later, a letter from Glasgow landed through Nina\u2019s mailbox.\n\n\u201cThanks for the postcard,\u201d wrote Derek. \u201cNow my mates will believe me when tell them I went swimming at midnight with a Swedish girl, they thought I just got drunk and fell in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from there on, we started writing letters to each other,\u201d says Nina.\n\nIn his letters, Derek wrote about his construction job and friends in Glasgow. Meanwhile Nina told stories from the radio station. They swapped music recommendations and re-lived their favorite moments from Greece.\n\nTime passed, and their correspondence continued. The letters weren\u2019t obviously romantic. But they were long and conversation topics often went deep.\n\nA Scottish adventure\n\nIn the summer of 1991, Nina visited Derek in Scotland.\n\nThe two reunited at Glasgow Central train station. Nina strolled off the train with a big perm, wearing a pair of overalls over shorts, carrying a rucksack.\n\nWhile it still wasn\u2019t entirely clear if this was a romantic visit, both Nina and Derek were pleased to see each other. And then Derek set about showing Nina around Scotland.\n\n\u201cWe had just the two of us, a couple of days up in the Highlands,\u201d recalls Derek. \u201cA little silver Mini Metro, Crowded House in the cassette and visiting scenic spots \u2014 Loch Lomond, Glen Coe, Robert the Bruce statue, Aviemore\u2026\u201d\n\nThen, after being, as he puts it, \u201cAWOL in Scotland for three days\u201d Derek had to attend his brother\u2019s wedding, and turned up at his future sister-in-law\u2019s door with Nina.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018This is Nina. Could she borrow a dress? She\u2019s coming to the wedding tomorrow,\u2019\u201d recalls Derek.\n\nDerek hadn\u2019t mentioned Nina\u2019s visit to his brother and future sister-in-law in advance \u2014 he wasn\u2019t sure how things would pan out, and didn\u2019t want to assume Nina would be interested in coming along.\n\nBut after their Highlands adventure, Derek wanted Nina to be his wedding date.\n\n\u201cThat was my introduction to the family,\u201d says Nina, of the moment she found herself standing, slightly awkwardly, on Derek\u2019s future sister-in-law\u2019s doorstep.\n\nDerek\u2019s future sister-in-law was, initially, less than impressed by the prospect of a last-minute extra guest. But she glanced between Nina and Derek, and then relented, dug through her closet and lent Nina a wedding-appropriate outfit.\n\nDerek and Nina attended Derek's brother's wedding together in May 1991, with Nina borrowing clothes from the bride the night before. Derek and Nina Barclay\n\n\u201cSo then Nina came to the wedding and met the whole family,\u201d says Derek. \u201cAnd my mother introduced everyone as if she were my girlfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kept saying, \u2018No, no, not a girlfriend, friend,\u2019\u201d recalls Nina.\n\nNina and Derek hadn\u2019t had a conversation confirming they were officially dating \u2014 though they both wanted that to be true. But it was as though Derek\u2019s mother had helpfully confirmed it for them. And after a while, Nina stopped correcting her.\n\nA few months later, Derek visited Nina in Sweden, and the two went to T\u00e4rnaby in the Lapland mountains, where Nina\u2019s brother kept a log cabin.\n\nWhile meeting Nina\u2019s six brothers was a little intimidating, Derek also felt welcomed by the family. And it was fun and exciting to see Nina\u2019s home country through her eyes.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be there\u2019\n\nDerek visited Nina in Sweden in September 1991. Here's the couple in Nina's brother's remote log cabin. Derek and Nina Barclay\n\nFollowing their time in Scotland and Derek\u2019s trip to Sweden, Derek and Nina were officially a long-distance couple. They continued to visit each other when money allowed, and wrote letters regularly.\n\nThis state of play lasted for three years. But by 1994, the couple were starting to wonder how to close the distance between them.\n\n\u201cIt takes a toll, because obviously we couldn\u2019t see each other as often as we would like,\u201d says Nina. \u201cAfter three years, we started saying, \u2018How do you feel about this? Do you want to live together?\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter weighing the options and discussing the respective pros and cons of life in Sweden and in the UK, the couple decided that Nina would move to London, where Derek had recently relocated for work. Nina was still working as a sound engineer, and it seemed like London would offer some exciting work opportunities in her field.\n\n\u201cSo then Derek proposed and I said, \u2018Yeah, sure, I will be there,\u2019\u201d says Nina.\n\nShe headed to the airport with few possessions beyond her wedding dress (\u201cIt was stuffed under my arm,\u201d says Nina) and a beloved boombox.\n\nNina and Derek were married in Renfrew, in Scotland, a town close to Glasgow. Derek\u2019s sister, who worked for the local council, married the couple, and Nina took Derek\u2019s last name, becoming Nina Barclay.\n\nDerek and Nina got married in Scotland in 1994. Urban Andersson\n\n\u201cIt was so nice,\u201d says Nina of their wedding day. \u201cI\u2019m from a big family \u2014 who all came with the food \u2014 so we had a real mix of Swedish culture and Scottish culture. It was memorable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d agrees Derek, who says this was true despite the fact he was slightly hungover all day.\n\n\u201cThe night before the wedding is when all Nina\u2019s brothers arrived from Sweden. So we went for my stag night (bachelor party) the night before the wedding, which wasn\u2019t a good idea in Glasgow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that stag nights were so heavy in Scotland. I thought they were like in Sweden, quite civilized,\u201d says Nina, laughing. \u201cHe was quite tired the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can see that in the photographs,\u201d says Derek. \u201cI don\u2019t look well.\u201d\n\nNina and Derek\u2019s honeymoon was \u201cone day in Oban\u201d \u2014 a coastal town in the west of Scotland. Nina and Derek toasted their future over fish and chips, then returned to London where they moved into a small apartment in the city\u2019s South Norwood neighborhood.\n\nThe couple\u2019s first few years of married life were \u201cvery tough financially,\u201d says Derek, but they delighted in each other\u2019s company and in their joy at finally living together after years of long distance.\n\nThey made their own traditions, too.\n\n\u201cSaturday night entertainment in London was Radio 4, the Saturday Play (we had no TV) and some snacks from Croydon Market,\u201d says Derek.\n\nA couple years went by, and things slowly got a little easier financially. Then, when the couple discovered Nina was pregnant, Nina and Derek decided to move to Glasgow to be closer to family.\n\nThey spent four years in Scotland, welcoming their daughter Alice, before Nina got offered a job back in Sweden, at which point Nina and Derek decided to give life in Stockholm a whirl. A year or so later, Nina gave birth to their second child, a boy called Rubin. A few years later, their son Hugo followed.\n\n35 years later\n\nDerek and Nina celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary in 2024 with a luxury train trip from Victoria Falls to Cape Town. Derek and Nina Barclay\n\nFast forward to today and Derek and Nina still live in Sweden. They\u2019ve been there since the late 1990s \u2014 bar a two-year stint where Derek\u2019s work took the family to Shenzhen in southern China.\n\nThis period in China helped reinforce Derek and Nina\u2019s bilingual kids\u2019 multinational view on the world. Their parents\u2019 origin story means they\u2019ve grown up with the encouragement to \u201ctravel and see things, meet people, they can be the nicest of people,\u201d as Nina puts it.\n\nTheir kids\u2019 experiences, Derek adds, are worlds away from his own \u2014 his Interrail trip at 21 was the first time he\u2019d left the UK.\n\n\u201cAnd then by the time our kids were 18, they had visited 24 countries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a different generation.\u201d\n\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary, Nina and Derek took their two children on an Interrailing trip around Europe, revisiting some of their 1990 haunts. Derek took a photo of the couple\u2019s daughter Alice sitting on the bench at Budapest train station where he first saw Nina. It\u2019s now one of his favorite photos.\n\nIn 2024, Nina and Derek marked their 30th wedding anniversary with a more luxurious railway adventure, traveling from Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Cape Town in South Africa via rail company Rovos Rail, just the two of them.\n\n\u201cWe still like to travel by train,\u201d says Nina.\n\nTo mark their 30th anniversary, Derek also enlisted his daughter\u2019s help to buy Nina a much-belated engagement ring. He was conscious they never really had a formal proposal back in 1994, and he\u2019d always wanted to give Nina a ring.\n\n\u201cAlice helped me pick the ring,\u201d says Derek. \u201cWhat she would like now would fit with what Nina would have liked 30 years ago.\u201d\n\n\"We still like to travel by train,\" says Nina today. Derek and Nina Barclay\n\nNina still has her scrapbook from the 1990 Interrailing trip. And in recent years, Derek and Nina were unexpectedly reunited with the dozens of letters exchanged during their long distance relationship.\n\nWhen Derek and Nina moved to Sweden, they left a bunch of things in boxes in Derek\u2019s mother\u2019s Glasgow apartment \u2014 including, unintentionally, piles of letters tied with red ribbon.\n\n\u201cThen, when Derek\u2019s mother passed away, it was totally forgotten, all this stuff in the attic,\u201d says Nina.\n\nSome months later, the next tenant of the apartment, a young woman, stumbled across the letters \u2014 curled and yellowed with time.\n\n\u201cShe took it to the local council and said, \u2018Look, this must be something from the wartime,\u2019\u201d says Nina.\n\nThis was despite the fact the stamps indicated the letters were from the 1990s.\n\n\u201cBut she was just so excited, spotted them, thought she found something from the war, and handed them over to the county council,\u201d says Nina. \u201cIt was sweet.\u201d\n\nThe council workers quickly discounted this wartime romance theory and instead focused on the last name on the envelopes. They guessed the letters might have something to do with Derek\u2019s sister, who had the same last name and still worked at the council.\n\nWhen she was approached by her colleagues, Derek\u2019s sister confirmed these were 1990s love letters between Derek and Nina, and reunited the missives with their writers.\n\nNina and Derek laugh a lot telling this story \u2014 especially the idea their \u201890s letters were mistaken for historically-important wartime relics.\n\nBut they\u2019re also really grateful to have been reunited with these special mementos of the early years of their romance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fun to look at occasionally, but we need to hide them before we die, so no one else gets to read them,\u201d says Derek, laughing.\n\nToday, Derek and Nina describe themselves as \u201cbest friends as much as spouses.\u201d\n\nThey \u201calways look out for each other,\u201d says Derek.\n\nAnd they\u2019re always grateful that their railway adventures brought them together.\n\n\u201cWe could have walked into the next carriage. We could have been somewhere else on the train and never met,\u201d says Derek. \u201cIt was fate.\u201d",

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nStill crafting your 2025 travel plans?\n\nFor those looking for an urban escape, there\u2019s no finer source of inspiration than Time Out\u2019s annual list of the world\u2019s best cities.\n\nSo which destination came out on top this year? Here\u2019s a hint:\n\n\u201cWhere else can you visit a colony of African penguins, taste world-class wines, stroll Blue Flag beaches, enjoy views from one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, and experience vibrant nightlife \u2014 all in a day?\u201d asks Time Out.\n\nThe answer is of course Cape Town, which scored highly across the board.\n\n\u201cSteeped in history and cultural significance, Cape Town provides visitors with a plethora of options to learn, explore, and have fun, all without breaking the bank,\u201d says Time Out of South Africa\u2019s oldest city.\n\nTo compile the annual list, the company surveyed more than 18,500 city-dwellers, as well as its own panel of 100 experts. They were asked for insights on topics that are near and dear to travelers\u2019 hearts, including food, nightlife, culture, affordability, livability and the overall city vibe.

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIn travel news this week: misbehavior on planes, secrets of a cruise ship doctor and the flight routes that were most prone to turbulence in 2024.\n\nBumpy rides\n\nTurbulence on flights is usually caused by mountains, storms or powerful jet stream currents, so it\u2019s not surprising that rocky ranges feature prominently in a new list of flight routes that had the most turbulence in 2024, according to tracker site Turbli.com.\n\nThe Andes in South America and the Himalayas in Asia are a recurring factor in the bumpy routes featured in its top 10, which is based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the UK Met Office.\n\nHaving analyzed 10,000 routes connecting 550 of the world\u2019s largest airports, it found the route most prone to turbulence was the 196-kilometer (122-mile) trip between Mendoza (MDZ) and Santiago (SCL).\n\nThe journey starts in Argentina\u2019s stunning Mendoza region, famous for wine, olive oil and outdoor pursuits such as mountaineering, rafting and horse riding. It then flies west over the Andes to Santiago, the Chilean capital, which sits in a valley surrounded by the snowy Andean peaks and the Chilean Coastal Range.\n\nLast year is now officially the hottest year on record, with scientific analyses saying that is playing a role in recent extreme weather events, with the LA wildfires being the latest example. (Find out here how you can help residents affected by the unprecedented fires).\n\nRising temperatures might also contribute to an increase in severe \u201cclear air\u201d turbulence, which strikes fast and offers no visual cues. While incidents are predicted to rise, experts say it doesn\u2019t mean flying will be less safe.\n\nPeople and planes\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of travel-based misbehavior this month already, with a JetBlue passenger arrested for opening the emergency exit door on a plane, a man caught with a crocodile skull in his luggage in Delhi and a woman stopped in Germany with 90 kilos (nearly 200 pounds) of luxury chocolate from Dubai. Read more here about the viral treat that people are going crazy for.\n\nIrish airline Ryanair is cracking down hard on unruly passengers by suing a traveler for $15,000 in damages following \u201cunnecessary disruption\u201d on a flight from Dublin to Lanzarote in Spain last year.\n\nHowever, there have been recent heartwarming tales as well. In December, a United Airlines pilot raced through a Texas airport to surprise an old friend: the woman who saved his life.\n\nAnd in October, a Delta Air Lines crew \u2013 and a plane full of well-wishing passengers \u2013 helped reunite a mother and daughter for a precious final goodbye. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt wasn\u2019t one person who did one huge thing, it was a lot of people doing a really nice thing,\u201d says daughter Hannah White.\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nPlenty of idyllically located Italian villages with aging populations have been making headlines in recent years, most often for the boom in one-euro homes.\n\nNow a little town in the southern region of Calabria has taken the unusual step of banning its residents from falling ill. It\u2019s home to a beautiful hilltop castle, but its mayor says its health-care facilities are less of an attraction.\n\nBecoming sick at sea is another hazard few think about in advance. CNN Travel took a look at the life of a cruise ship doctor, from heart attacks to dealing with death.\n\nIn Germany, doctors can prescribe four-week spa breaks to frazzled parents. The country has a long history of what is called \u201cKur,\u201d which translates as \u201ccure\u201d and often consists of getaways aimed at alleviating maladies.\n\nTo help you avoid ailments including blood clots and deep-vein thrombosis when traveling, compression socks are a great idea.

                "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nDemocrats are in freefall.\n\nAs of Monday, Donald J. Trump is officially the 47th president of the United States. He starts his second term in the Oval Office with a bang \u2013 rolling out dozens of executive orders fulfilling promises made to American voters -- and more popular than he has ever been.\n\nDemocrats have no idea how to respond. Their party is currently earning its lowest approval ratings ever, for good reason. It is guilty of perpetrating the greatest political scandal of our lifetimes -- pretending President Joe Biden was OK to run for another four years. Their efforts to brand Donald Trump a threat to Democracy were a bust and their leadership is in disarray. They deserve every minute they serve in political purgatory.\n\nA former communications director for Kamala Harris says Democrats \"got to burn down our image.\" He\u2019s right.\n\nTRUMP'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS WAS A TRIUMPH FOR HIM, AND FOR HIS SUPPORTERS\n\nThe party\u2019s trials will not end soon. As Trump takes office, he and his team will shine a spotlight on Democrats\u2019 dishonest efforts to bar him from public office, from bogus lawsuits aiming to put him in jail to the Russiagate hoax. The country wants accountability for those trying to censor right-wing voices and for hiding evidence of Biden family corruption.\n\nIn issuing pardons to some of the miscreants, like Anthony Fauci and Liz Cheney, Biden acknowledges their complicity. By extending pardons also to numerous Biden family members, Joe is all but admitting they aided and abetted the influence-peddling and pay-to-play activities led by Hunter Biden. What a shameful exit, reinforcing Biden\u2019s standing as one of the most unpopular presidents of all time.\n\nDemocrats now must rebuild their trust with the American people. They have lost favor (and elections) because they don\u2019t know what they stand for or who they represent. Joe Biden in his farewell address talked about a mysterious \"oligarchy\" of \"extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy,\" but most think that\u2019s the crowd who threw a billion dollars into Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, only to see her lose.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS HIS SIBLINGS JUST MINUTES BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE\n\nGallup reports that for the third year in a row, slightly more Americans identify as Republicans (or GOP-leaning Independents) than Democrats; they note that before 2022, \"Republicans only had a slight edge once before, in 1991.\" That is a significant heads-up.\n\nThe slide in Democrat popularity has occurred mainly amongst Hispanics, young adults, lower-income Americans, those without a college degree, Catholics, and Black Americans. In short, Democrats are losing ground with the very groups they have relied on to win elections for several decades. Increasingly, the people supporting Democrats are college grads and people with above-average incomes \u2013 the limousine liberal set.\n\nDemocrats are coming unglued even as the leadership is fracturing. Squabbling between long-time party leaders like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi is embarrassing; one of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s daughters recently likened Joe\u2019s wife Jill Biden to Shakespeare\u2019s heartless and ambitious Lady MacBeth. That stings.\n\nThe Pelosi-Biden split is not just about personalities. It is also about the enormous Democrat-led conspiracy that allowed Joe Biden to become president in 2020 and that pushed for him to serve a second term, despite his obvious mental deterioration. Voters saw through the carefully-managed stagecraft that sought to hide Joe\u2019s impairment. Even half-way through his term a majority of the country thought he was too old to run.\n\nIncredibly, Joe Biden still thinks he could have beaten Donald Trump, proving that he has been kept in the dark by the people who surround him. This detachment from reality showed up as early as 2021, when Biden and his wife participated in a Christmas Eve call-in show. A caller naughtily told the Bidens, \"Merry Christmas and Let\u2019s Go Brandon,\" a popular and wide-spread slam against the president at the time. Biden, clueless, repeated the phrase, chuckling and saying, \"Let\u2019s Go Brandon, I agree\", showing how out of touch he was.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe information bubble may have protected Biden from mean tweets or negative polling, but it also allowed his political team to end-run the president and manage White House policy. We may never know the extent to which Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s first Chief of Staff, or ex-Obama apparatchiks like Susan Rice and Jeff Zients were in charge of policy.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson recently described a meeting in which he pressed Biden on why he had paused new permits for LNG exports, only to have the president deny taking such a measure. Johnson believed the president \"genuinely didn\u2019t know what he had signed\" and left the White House worried the nation is in \"serious trouble.\"\n\nSigns of Democrat weakness are everywhere. On the cusp of Trump\u2019s inauguration, their efforts to repulse his cabinet nominees look to be failing; their nasty personal attacks on Pete Hegseth, set to lead the Department of Defense, and Pam Bondi, likely to become our next attorney general, looked petty and mean-spirited rather than consequential. Equally distasteful has been the slew of last-minute lawsuits and executive actions issued from the White House, many of which set roadblocks before the incoming Trump administration.\n\nEven the liberal media is floundering, with many leading organizations, including the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, evidently reconsidering their role as Democrat propagandists. Only the New York Times remains resolute in its opposition to the incoming president, but then they have crossword puzzles and recipes to keep them afloat.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats need to decide who\u2019s in charge. The progressive wing of the party, which favored open borders and men playing in women\u2019s sports, will attempt to reassert its power. Within minutes of Trump\u2019s swearing in, left-wing groups sued to stop the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from shrinking the federal government and making it more effective.\n\nDOGE might be Trump\u2019s most popular initiative; trying to shut it down could, with other \"resistance\" moves, keep Democrats in the wilderness for a good long time. Fingers crossed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

                "text": "President Trump, immediately upon taking office, flexed his presidential powers as he followed through on some of the major pledges he made on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Today I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of commonsense,\" the nation's 47th president vowed during his inauguration address Monday at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHours later, Trump followed through, with an avalanche of executive order signings at Washington's Capitol One Arena, in front of thousands of supporters - a first in the nation's history - and later in the more traditional Oval Office setting at the White House.\n\n\"It's just pure Trump. He's the first president in a new connected world in which you have to govern from the outside in. You have to mount support and bring the people with you,\" veteran Republican strategist Alex Castellanos told Fox News Digital.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST DAY IN OFFICE\n\nTrump's immigration promises were a centerpiece of his successful presidential campaign to win back the White House.\n\n\"On Day One, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,\" the then-Republican presidential nominee vowed during a late October rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden.\n\nAnd Trump took immediate action during his first hours back in office.\n\nFIRST ON FOX: TRUMP VOWS OVER 200 EXECUTIVE ACTIONS ON DAY 1\n\nThe new president declared a national emergency along the southern border with Mexico and ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to help support immigration agents. Trump also ordered the restart of a policy from his first administration that forced asylum seekers to wait over the border in Mexico. But it's unclear if Mexico would accept migrants again.\n\nTrump also directed the federal government to resume border wall construction, begun during his first term but halted by President Biden.\n\nAnd Trump signed an order ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal migrants. But with birthright citizenship enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, Trump's executive order immediately faced legal challenges in court from civil rights groups and immigration activists.\n\n\"I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\" Trump emphasized in his inauguration address.\n\nTRUMP VOWS TO ACT WITH \u2018HISTORIC SPEED\u2019 AS INAUGURATION BRINGS REDEPMPTION\n\nAnd the president also announced that \"we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks.\"\n\nDuring his two-year run to return to the White House, Trump repeatedly vowed to \"drill, baby, drill,\" and pledged to end the Biden administration's electric vehicle mandate.\n\nOn Monday, Trump followed through, as he tied his energy executive orders to his efforts to keep inflation in check.\n\n\"I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation, and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump argued.\n\nAnd he said \"that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have. The largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth.\"\n\nDuring the 2024 cycle, Trump and Republicans repeatedly targeted Democrats up and down the ballot over the Biden administration's protections for transgender students\n\n\"We\u2019re going to end it on Day One,\" Trump vowed last May. \"Don\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it \u2014 on Day One, it\u2019s going to be changed.\"\n\nTrump followed through, taking executive action from what the president's advisers said would \"defend women from gender, ideology, extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government.\"\n\n\"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,\" the president said.\n\nThe president also signed orders terminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs - best known by their acronym DEI - within the federal government. The orders direct the White House to identify and end the programs within the government.\n\nAnother promise from the campaign trail - pardoning the defendants and commuting the sentences of many of those convicted of charges from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who unsuccessfully tried to halt congressional certification of President Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nTrump didn't mention the pardons in his inauguration address, but minutes later as he spoke to supporters gathered in an overflow room in the U.S. Capitol, he reiterated his longstanding unproven claim that the 2020 presidential election \"was totally rigged.\"\n\nA couple of hours later, in front of cheering supporters packed into Washington DC's downtown arena, Trump touted that he would be \"signing pardons for a lot of people\u2026to get them out\" immediately.\n\nHe wasn't kidding.\n\nThe president, back at the White House, ended up pardoning around 1,500 people - including some convicted of attacking police officers - obliterating the Justice Department's effort to punish those who stormed the Capitol on one of America's darkest days.\n\n\"These people have been destroyed,\" Trump argued as he signed the pardons. \"What they\u2019ve done to these people has been outrageous.\"\n\nTrump also took action on something that didn't come up on the campaign trail.\n\n\"A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,\" Trump declared in his inauguration address.\n\nAnd pointing to Alaska's Mount Denali, which is North America's tallest peak, the president said \"we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\"\n\n\"He's flooding the zone. He's making a case for action. He's demonstrating action. He is rallying a wave of American support for a massive transformation of government,\" Castellanos, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. \"I think it's overwhelming and Democrats just don't know what's hitting them.\"\n\n\"Could you imagine Biden doing this. I don't think so,\" the president said, as he signed executive orders in front of thousands of his supporters.\n\nBut Trump didn't follow through on all of his campaign promises.\n\nTRUMP ENVOY SETS LONGER TIMETABLE TO END RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR\n\nOne of his most prominent vows he didn't act on during his first day in office involved immediately ending a deadly war in Eastern Europe.\n\nTrump repeatedly touted on the campaign trail that he would end the nearly three-year-long war between Russia and Ukraine \"in one day.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I\u2019ll have that done \u2014 I\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours,\" Trump vowed during a May 2023 town hall.\n\nAnd in September, during his single debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump vowed \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"\n\nThat, obviously, didn't happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd earlier this month, retired Gen. Keith Kellog, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, offered a longer timetable.\n\n\"I would like to set a goal on a personal level, professional level, I would say let\u2019s set it at 100 days,\" he said in a Fox News Channel interview.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Monday night in the Oval Office, when asked about his day one pledge to end the fighting, Trump would only say \"we're going to try and get it done as quickly as possible.\"",

Kevin Lunday said coast guardsmen would work to detect and deter illegal migration in support of Trump's executive orders issued this week.\n\n\"The U.S. Coast Guard is the world\u2019s premiere maritime law enforcement agency, vital to protecting America\u2019s maritime borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Lunday said. \"Per the President\u2019s Executive Orders, I have directed my operational commanders to immediately surge assets\u2014cutters, aircraft, boats and deployable specialized forces\u2014to increase Coast Guard presence and focus\u2026\"\n\nRETIRED COAST GUARD HELICOPTER COMMANDER DETAILS RISKS TO AIR CREWS FIGHTING LA FIRES\n\nKey areas where authorities will focus their efforts include the waters off Florida to deter and prevent migrants from Haiti and Cuba from entering the U.S., and maritime borders around Alaska, Hawaii, as well as the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, American Somoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nLunday also wrote in the release that the agency would target the \"maritime border between Texas and Mexico in the Gulf of America.\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. In the federal executive order : \"Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,\" Section 4 rebrands the \"area formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico\u2026 an integral asset to our once burgeoning nation \u2026and an indelible part of America\" \u2013 as the \"Gulf of America.\"\n\nThe reference appears to be the first time a federal agency has acknowledged the name change.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it would also target the Bahamas and South Florida, and between the U.S. and Mexico in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn addition, the Coast Guard will support U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authorities on maritime portions of the southwest U.S. border.\n\n\"Together, in coordination with our Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense teammates, we will detect, deter and interdict illegal migration, drug smuggling and other terrorist or hostile activity before it reaches our border,\" a news release states.\n\n6 SUSPECTS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN DEADLY HUMAN SMUGGLING INCIDENTS OVER THE PAST WEEK, COAST GUARD SAYS\n\nOn Monday, Trump also issued a flurry of executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration.\n\nAmong the many charges was the termination of Adm. Linda Lee Fagan, 61, who was fired by Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Benjamine Huffman.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHuffman didn't cite a reason for the dismissal, but a senior DHS official told Fox News that Fagan was removed for failure to address border security threats, insufficient leadership in recruitment and retention, mismanagement in acquiring key acquisitions such as icebreakers and helicopters, excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and an \"erosion of trust\" over the mishandling and cover-up of Operation Fouled Anchor, which was the Coast Guard's internal investigation into sexual assault cases at the Coast Guard Academy.\n\nFox News Digital's Charles Creitz contributed to this report.",

And Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.\"\n\n\"American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form, and that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\"\n\nThe canal\u2019s administrator, Ricaurte V\u00e1squez, said this month that China is not in control of the canal and that all nations are treated equally under a neutrality treaty.\n\nThe 51-mile maritime trade route uses a series of locks and reservoirs to cut through the middle of Panama and connect the Atlantic and Pacific. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts.\n\nThe canal spares ships having to sail around Cape Horn at South America\u2019s southern tip, saving it a roughly 7,000-mile journey.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPanama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino issued a statement rejecting Trump\u2019s comments and said, \"The Canal is and will continue to be Panama's and its administration will continue to be under Panamanian control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\"\n\n\"There is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\" he added, taking issue with Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. \"gave\" the canal to Panama.\n\n\"Dialogue is always the way to clarify the points mentioned without undermining our right, total sovereignty and ownership of our Canal,\" Mulino said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Caitlin McFall and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Democrat lawmakers in Washington, D.C., pushed back against the GOP-led Protection of Women and Girls in Sports act last week with unsubstantiated arguments that the law would enable sexual predators to give genital examinations to young girls.\n\nThis argument was not rooted in any language within the bill, as Republicans insisted that no genital inspection would ever be necessary and that proof of birth gender could simply be determined with a birth certificate.\n\nStill, many prominent Democrats, including House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used the sexual predator argument in statements and during testimony on the House of Representatives floor.\n\nThis tactic has alienated some of the party's loyal voters, who have unregistered as Democrats in response.\n\nProminent Rutgers law professor Gary Francione has been a lifelong Democrat dating back to the 1970s. In November's general elections, he voted for Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., who was one of 206 Democrats to vote against the bill last Tuesday.\n\nBut Francione, who is an advocate for LGBTQ rights, abortion rights and even a vegan and animal rights abolitionist, said he was so offended by the Democrat representatives who tried to tie the bill to empowering child predators that he unregistered as a Democrat after last Tuesday's hearing.\n\n\"That just made me very upset because it screamed out lack of integrity, lack of honesty,\" Francione told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"This is the way you fight battles? By trying to insult other people who oppose you and disagree with you and insinuate that they're child molesters or pedophiles? It seems to me you've lost the game. \u2026 I don't know how they're ever going to come back from this.\"\n\nFrancione has a lifelong network of other Democrats in the field of law and other industries, and he says many of them share his beliefs and will also be unregistering from the party.\n\n\"I can say confidently of the people I know who are Democrats who I've spoken to, the vast majority of them are very unhappy about all of this stuff and feel that the party has lost its way,\" Francione said. \"I know a couple who said they are going to [unregister].\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nFrancione initially announced his departure from the party in a viral post on X over the weekend. Many of his thousands of followers replied insisting they would follow his lead in unregistering from the party in response to the congressional representatives' attempt to tie the bill to empowering sexual predators.\n\n\"This is what I have done. That is when I drew the line and swapped registration,\" one user replied.\n\n\"I know the feeling. They drive you to it. Welcome to the club,\" another wrote.\n\nFrancione said the premise of allowing trans athletes to compete against females is \"discriminatory\" against girls and women, and he went so far as to call the Democrat argument against the bill \"insane\" and \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"I thought it was very unfair to the large number of very decent people who are concerned about fairness and safety in women's sports,\" he said. \"These young girls, they train hard, they work hard, and then they get things taken away from them by men!\"\n\nEven former U.S. Olympic cyclist Inga Thompson admitted in a recent interview that even though she\u2019s a lifelong Democrat, she was hopeful for President Donald Trump\u2019s incoming presidency because of his stance on protecting women and girls in sports.\n\nMultiple Democrat congressional representatives have chosen to refer to the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act as the \"House GOP Child Predator Empowerment Act.\" These individuals include Jeffries, Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and many of the other 206 Democrats who voted against the bill.\n\nOcasio-Cortez dismissed the fact that there is no language in the bill that suggests any child would be subject to genital inspections during her argument.\n\n\"The majority right now says there's no place in this bill that says it opens up for genital examinations. Well, here's the thing, there's no enforcement mechanism in this bill. And when there is no enforcement mechanism, you open the door to every enforcement mechanism!\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez later proclaimed, \"Trans girls are girls!\"\n\nBut many Democrats who opposed the bill strictly opposed it based on the unsubstantiated premise that it would empower sexual predators without even advocating for the right of trans athletes to compete in women's sports, as enabling trans inclusion became a widely unpopular stance in November's election.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., was one of those who took that stance. Moulton previously said that he believed Democrats advocating for trans inclusion was an issue that cost them in November, and he repeatedly defended his stance of opposing trans inclusion despite backlash from those in his own party and state in the weeks that followed President Donald Trump's victory and Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nHOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE\n\nBut Moulton still voted against the bill on Tuesday, saying he does not want children to be \"subjected to the invasive violations of personal privacy this bill allows.\"\n\nJust two Democrats joined the Republican majority in voting in favor of the bill: Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, and Vicente Gonzales, D-Texas. Their decision to defect from the rest of the party and vote for the protection of women and girls in sports reflects a growing widespread position of many voters in their party and independents, according to recent data.\n\nA recent New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShortly after November's election, a national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women\u2019s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women\u2019s bathrooms\" as important to them.\n\nAnd 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\"\n\nFrancione is one of the many longtime Democrat voters who believe the lawmakers in his party have failed in carrying out the will of their constituents on this issue.\n\n\"Progressives have failed,\" he added. \"Progressives have created a grievance Olympics \u2026 and it doesn't work.\"",

Harris argued in a new piece that President Donald Trump\u2019s second victory proves that he has dominated American politics so thoroughly that he will likely be counted among the country\u2019s most consequential leaders.\n\nHarris clarified that he was not describing Trump as a righteous or evil character, nor was he saying that Trump has been a successful president, but he reiterated that his impact is monumental either way.\n\n\"He is a force of history,\" Harris declared in his column published Tuesday.\n\nTRUMP'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS A TRIUMPH FOR HIM, HIS SUPPORTERS\n\nThe editor-in-chief said Trump\u2019s second inauguration on Monday puts the president in an \"entirely new light\" \u2013 he is now \"holding power under circumstances in which reasonable people cannot deny a basic fact: He is the greatest American figure of his era.\"\n\nHarris explained that assessment of Trump is \"an objective description about the dimensions of his record,\" noting how the president began by \"dominating\" the GOP nearly a decade ago and now dominates \"every discussion of American politics broadly.\"\n\nHe noted that Trump\u2019s second victory proves he is \"not a fluke\" despite his opponents in the media hammering his flaws for almost ten years. \"He is someone with an ability to perceive opportunities that most politicians do not and forge powerful, sustained connections with large swaths of people in ways that no contemporary can match,\" the editor-in-chief stated, adding that he himself has been \"slow\" to see this power.\n\nHarris went to say that Trump\u2019s political opponents must do away with their strategy to paint Trump as a political aberration. \"They cannot push Trump to the margins, by treating him as a momentary anomaly or simply denouncing him as lawless and illegitimate,\" he stated.\n\nDEMS PROMISE TO 'STAND UP TO' TRUMP BUT LAUD 'PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER' AFTER SPEECH\n\n\"Opponents have no choice but to acknowledge he and his movement represent a large historical argument \u2014 and then rally similarly large arguments to defeat it.\"\n\nHarris continued by comparing Trump\u2019s individual traits to those marking \"the most consequential presidents.\"\n\n\"Like influential predecessors, his arguments have shifted the terms of debate in ways that echo within both parties \u2014 in this case, on issues such as trade, China, and the role of big corporations,\" he said, adding, \"Like other large presidents, Trump has been a communications innovator and exploited technological shifts more effectively than rivals.\"\n\nThe author also pointed to Trump\u2019s \"uncommon psychological toughness\" as a \"signature shown by the most consequential presidents.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\n\"Imagine running for president amid huge civil suits, criminal prosecutions, and even felony convictions \u2014 then emerging from this morass as a larger figure than before. No one needs to admire the achievement to recognize that Trump is possessed by some rare traits of denial, combativeness and resilience.\"\n\nHarris noted several of the great unifying presidents of American history were also seen as controversial and somewhat divisive in their day, suggesting that Trump could also be cast in this light in the years ahead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has yet to prove he can be the unifier, he added however, writing, \"What he didn\u2019t show in his first term, or on his improbable pathway to a second, was an ability to bring these conflicts to resolution, to unite the country on a new level of understanding. This would require Trump revealing a new understanding about himself and how to use the next four years.\"",

But it's a revolution in many other industries as well. Medicine just touches us all,\" he said. \"Yes, it takes a huge investment, but the result of the investment will be vaccines that prevent cancers, personalized medicine where we never again run into a problem like COVID-19 before because we get an early warning. We know when COVID starts, when there are a handful of patients, rather than having to wait until it's become an epidemic and very difficult to control.\"\n\nThe initial investment for the project will be $100 billion, with plans to expand to $500 billion over the next four years.

                "text": "NEW ORLEANS \u2013 A historic and deadly winter storm that stretched over 1,500 miles blanketed the southern U.S. on Tuesday with historic snow totals, including the first-ever Blizzard Warning for the Gulf Coast and potentially record amounts of snow in Florida.\n\nSnow totals reached numbers not seen in generations, if not lifetimes, across the South. Up to 4 inches in Houston, nearly 10 inches around New Orleans, and towns along the Florida Panhandle reporting some 5 to 12 inches. While the snow and ice totals were meager by northern standards, it was enough to paralyze travel throughout the region.\n\nFIRST-EVER BLIZZARD WARNING ISSUED ALONG GULF COAST AS DEADLY WINTER STORM SLAMS TEXAS\n\nHouston airports shutter amid winter storm\n\nThe rare bout with wintry weather first swept across southwestern Texas early Tuesday morning, leading to a crash involving \"several fatalities\" east of La Pryor, according to Uvalde County officials.\n\nFirst responders said the icy conditions hampered the response to a deadly crash that occurred southwest of San Antonio.\n\nSnow moved across major Texas cities later Tuesday, bringing snow and sleet to Austin and San Antonio before strengthening over southeastern Texas.\n\nA thick blanket of snow fell across the Houston metro area as temperatures dropped into the 20s with wind chills in the teens. Schools and airports were closed and residents were encouraged to stay home in the dangerous conditions.\n\nBy mid-morning Tuesday, records were falling across Louisiana as most areas saw snowfall rates of an inch per hour. A first-ever Blizzard Warning was issued for parts of the Gulf Coast, including southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.\n\nParts of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2013 paralleling the Interstate 10 corridor \u2013 saw more than 7 inches of snow Tuesday, while New Orleans' airport reported 8\" of powder.\n\nAnd in Ozark, Alabama, officials reported a death from a fatal crash during a period of icy weather on Tuesday.\n\nSNOW BLANKETS NEW ORLEANS DURING HISTORIC GULF COAST WINTER STORM\n\nNew Orleans remained under a Winter Storm Warning \u2013 only the second time on record for Orleans Parish, where some 8\" of snowfall occured.\n\nnext Image 1 of 14\n\nprev next Image 2 of 14\n\nprev next Image 3 of 14\n\nprev next Image 4 of 14\n\nprev next Image 5 of 14\n\nprev next Image 6 of 14\n\nprev next Image 7 of 14\n\nprev next Image 8 of 14\n\nprev next Image 9 of 14\n\nprev next Image 10 of 14\n\nprev next Image 11 of 14\n\nprev next Image 12 of 14\n\nprev next Image 13 of 14\n\nprev Image 14 of 14\n\nParts of interstates 55, 10 and 12 in Louisiana closed for part of Tuesday due to hazardous winter conditions.\n\nBeachgoers trade sand for snow\n\nLocations along the Gulf Coast known for their marine activities and beaches were also in the snow globe created by the historic winter storm.\n\nSnow blanketed beaches and palm trees from Galveston, Texas, to Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nThe NWS office in Mobile reported 6.2\" of snow at Mobile Regional Airport, which broke their all-time snowfall record.\n\nSEE IT: GULF COAST BEACHES COVERED WITH SNOW DURING HISTORIC WINTER STORM\n\nEven Northwest and Northeast Florida and parts of southern Georgia saw snow, leading to road shutdowns, airport closures and breaking records.\n\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\nRecord-setting snow for Florida\n\nPerhaps no place feels more in a surreal alternate universe than the Florida Panhandle, which is on track to shatter previous state records for snowfall.\n\nWhile the official state record is 4.0 inches, unofficial snow reports across the Panhandle are well over that mark, with 8.8 inches reported in Milton and 6.5 inches reported along Pensacola Beach as of Tuesday evening.\n\n\"We used to think Blizzard Beach was a theme park in Orlando. It turns out that we may see some snow on our beaches throughout northwest Florida and even into Tallahassee and beyond,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday.\n\nThe main entrance to the Naval Air Station in Pensacola was closed on Tuesday due to icy road conditions created by the storm.\n\nWinter weather effectively shut down the Jacksonville International Airport on Tuesday night. Airport officials expect it will reopen by noon Wednesday.\n\nDeSantis said the state has over 250 Department of Transportation team members and nearly 200 pieces of heavy equipment ready to support with pre-staged items, including deicing chemicals and 11 snowplows.\n\n\"Believe it or not, in the state of Florida, we're mobilizing snowplows,\" he said.",

Trump had ousted Bolton from his first administration in 2019, and Biden had granted him a security detail in 2021.\n\nWhen asked by reporters on Tuesday why he stripped Bolton of his security clearance, Trump said, \"Because I think that was enough time.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives,\" he said. \"Why should we?\"\n\nUS OFFERS $20M FOR IRANIAN IN PLOT TARGETING TRUMP\u2019S EX-NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON\n\n\"The Justice Department filed criminal charges against an Iranian Revolutionary Guard official in 2022 for attempting to hire a hit man to target me. That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination,\" Bolton continued in his statement. \"The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"\n\nThe Iranian threats against Bolton were likely sparked by the January 2020 U.S. strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, the Department of Justice reported in 2022.\n\nBolton served as Trump's national security advisor between 2018 and 2019, before Trump ousted him because they \"disagreed strongly\" on policy issues.\n\nBIDEN SAYS TRUMP HAS NO \u2018REDEEMING VALUE,' PRETENDS TO SQUASH HIM LIKE A BUG AMID IRANIAN ASSASSINATION THREAT\n\n\"I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\" Trump tweeted in 2019. \"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\"\n\nIn the following years, Trump repeatedly has slammed Bolton, including claiming he would have sparked \"World War Six,\" and calling him \"one of the dumbest people in Government\" back in 2023.\n\nTRUMP SAYS IRANIAN PRESIDENT BEING GUARDED AT UN WHILE PLOTTING ASSASSINATION \u2018A STRANGE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES\u2019\n\nBolton also has taken his shots at Trump, claiming in a 2020 interview that Trump lacks \"the competency to carry out the job.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit for office,\" Bolton said in 2020. \"I don\u2019t think he has the competency to carry out the job.

The zoo said the animals are not used to being in larger herds and do not have the skills or desire to join one.\n\nThe zoo applauded the ruling and said the legal fight over the issue was disappointing, accusing the Nonhuman Rights Project of \"abusing court systems\" for fundraising.\n\n\"It seems their real goal is to manipulate people into donating to their cause by incessantly publicizing sensational court cases with relentless calls for supporters to donate,\" the zoo said in a statement.\n\nBABY GORILLA FOUND IN PLANE CARGO RECOVERING AT TURKISH ZOO\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project said the latest ruling \"perpetuates a clear injustice\" and predicted that courts in future cases would reject the idea that only humans have a right to liberty.\n\n\"As with other social justice movements, early losses are expected as we challenge an entrenched status quo that has allowed Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou, and Jambo to be relegated to a lifetime of mental and physical suffering,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                "text": "Border czar Tom Homan on Tuesday said that the mass deportation operation has already started, as the Trump administration looks to make good on promises to tackle the border crisis and crack down against illegal immigration.\n\n\"No, it started [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] teams are out there as of today,\" Homan said on \"America\u2019s Newsroom.\" \"We gave them direction to prioritize public safety threats that we're looking for. We've been working up the target list.\"\n\nThe administration has promised to launch a \"historic\" mass deportation operation, and sources told Fox News Digital that arrests were being planned on \"day one.\" Some media outlets reported on Friday about an operation in Chicago, but Homan said that was re-evaluated due to the leak of information.\n\nTRUMP DHS REPEALS KEY MAYORKAS MEMO LIMITING ICE AGENTS, ORDERS PAROLE REVIEW\n\n\"There was some discussion about Chicago because the specific operational plan was released. So we had to look at and reevaluate, \u2018Does this raise officer safety concerns?\u2019 And it does. But we've addressed that and teams are out there, effective today,\" he said.\n\nAs for who will be targeted in the operation, Homan said that the priority are public safety threats, but he has said repeatedly that no-one is \"off the table\" when it comes to arrests if they\u2019re in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"Right out of the gate it\u2019s public safety threats, those who are in the country illegally that have been convicted, arrested for serious crime,\" he said. \"But let me be clear. There's not only public safety threats that will be arrested, because in sanctuary cities, we're not allowed to get that public safety threat in the jail, which means we got to go to the neighborhood and find him.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\n\"And when we find him, he may be with others. And unlike the last administration, we're not going to tell ICE officers not to arrest an illegal alien. So if they find, others will be arrested. So sanctuary cities will get exactly what they don't want, more agents in their neighborhoods and more collateral arrests,\" he said.\n\nHoman spoke hours after Fox News reported on two DHS memos, including one that rescinded a 2021 memo by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which provided an expanded list of areas that are \"protected areas\" where ICE could not engage in immigration enforcement. It said the policy was designed to make sure enforcement did not limit \"people\u2019s access to essential services or engagement in essential activities.\"\n\n\u2018NATIONAL EMERGENCY': TRUMP DECLARES AMBITIOUS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS\n\nThose areas include schools, universities, healthcare facilities, places of worship, \"places where children gather,\" social service establishments, food banks, religious or civil ceremonies and disaster or emergency response and relief centers.\n\nThe memo issued Monday rescinded that guidance and said that common sense should be used instead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Going forward, law enforcement officers should continue to use that discretion along with a healthy dose of common sense,\" the new memo said. \"It is not necessary, however, for the head of the agency to create bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.\"",

                "text": "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance looked visibly irritated during the national prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral on Tuesday when the sermon took a political turn.\n\nAmong the faith leaders who spoke was Right Reverend Mariann Edgar Budde, who had been a vocal critic of Trump and the U.S. government following George Floyd's death.\n\nOn Trump's first full day back in office, Budde, of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, delivered a sermon focused on \"unity,\" but her remarks grew pointed when she brought up immigrants and LGBTQ youth.\n\n\n\nThe reverend spoke directly to the president, saying \"Let me make one final plea, Mr. President, millions have put their trust in you, and as you told the nation yesterday, you have felt the providential hand of a loving God. In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy on the people in our country who are scared. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic and Republican and Independent families, some who fear for their lives.\"\n\nTRUMP NOMINEES COLLINS, STEFANIK TO FACE SENATE GRILLING AS VA, UN PICKS; BESSENT GETS COMMITTEE VOTE\n\n\n\n\"And the people \u2013 the people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings, who labor in poultry farms and meet packing plants, who wash the dishes at their restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals, they \u2013 they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors,\" Budde said. \"They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues\u2026 and temples.\"\n\n\n\nThe reverend asked Trump to have \"mercy on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away, and that you help those who are fleeing war zones of persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome, our God teaches us that we are to be merciful to a stranger.\"\n\nThe vice president and second lady leaned over and whispered to one another during the sermon.\n\n\n\nAt the start of her remarks, Budde began to \"pray for unity as people and nation, not for agreement, political or otherwise, but for the kind of unity that fosters community across diversity and division, a unity that serves the common good.\"\n\n\n\n\"Unity, in this sense, is a threshold requirement for people to live in freedom and together in a free society,\" she said.\n\n\"Rather,\" Budde continued, \"Unity is a way of being with one another, and it encompasses and respects differences that teaches us to hold multiple perspectives and life experiences as valid and worthy of respect that enables us in our communities to genuinely care for one another, even when we disagree.\"\n\nTRUMP BRINGS BACK DIET COKE BUTTON TO WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE\n\nShe went on to say, \"Those of us gathered here, we are not naive about the realities of politics when power and wealth and competing interests are at stake, when views of what America should be are in conflict. When there are strong opinions across a spectrum of possibilities and starkly different understandings of what the right course of action is there, there will be winners and losers when those witness decisions made that set the course of public policy and the prioritization of resources.\"\n\n\"Not everyone's prayers will be answered in the way we would like. But for some, the loss of their hopes and dreams will be far more than political,\" she said, adding that \"all the faiths represented here affirm the birthright of all people as children of our one God. In public discourse, honoring each other's dignity means refusing to mock and model, discount, demonize those with whom we differ, choosing instead to respect, respectfully, to make our differences, and whenever possible, to seek common ground.\"\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump asserted that there are \"two genders, male and female,\" to thunderous applause.\n\n\"I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" he said. \"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based.\"\n\nThe president has promised mass deportations of criminal illegal immigrants and further sparked controversy by signing an executive order eliminating birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., criticized Budde for her remarks.\n\n\"The person giving this sermon should be added to the deportation list,\" he wrote in a post accompanied with a video of her speaking.\n\nIt's not the first time Budde has made her left-leaning political views known. A video clip from 2020 shows Budde speaking to an ABC News reporter while protesting in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"It is a message for a call to justice \u2013 for swift justice for George Floyd,\" Budde, wearing a face mask, said at the time. \"For systemic justice for all brown and Black people who have been under the knee of this country in ways that we have witnessed time and time again.\" She went on to say, \"This is wrong, and this rising up \u2013 this spontaneous uprising of people mostly half my age or younger, they are the ones we should be listening to.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nAsked about Trump, Budde said, \"I've given up speaking to President Trump. We need to replace President Trump.\"\n\nBudde also testified before Congress regarding a June 1, 2020, confrontation between demonstrators and law enforcement near St. John's Church in Lafayette Square.\n\nShe said \"our government resorted to acts of violence against peaceful protesters\" and said the Episcopal church believes the issues of \"racial and social justice are core tenants of the Christian faith.\"\n\nBudde also condemned Trump for holding up a Bible outside the church following the unrest. Testifying virtually at the time, she told a House committee, \"When the President held up a Bible outside our church as if to claim the mantle of spiritual authority over what had just transpired, I knew that I had to speak. Nowhere does the Bible condone the use of violence against the innocent.\"\n\nTrump revisited that same church on Monday morning before he was sworn in as the 47th president.\n\n\n\nFox News' Sarah Tobianski contributed to this report",

                "text": "Constitutional law attorney and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley reacted on \"America's Newsroom\" Tuesday to the pardons given by President Donald Trump to nearly all the Jan. 6 rioters charged with crimes. Turley said the \"shock and awe\" campaign used by the Biden Justice Department ended up undermining the prosecutions.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN PARDONS HIS SIBLINGS JUST MINUTES BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY: Well, the Department of Justice really made the case for these pardons, and it was hard to do because most of us supported the people responsible for the riot being held accountable. It was a terrible day. But the Justice Department unleashed what one of its top lawyers called a \u2018shock and awe\u2019 campaign, and they just scooped up hundreds of people. They often demanded really excessive sentences, in my view. Most of these people were charged with just trespass or unlawful entry. Most of them were not violent. The government tended to oppose bail, they kept a number of them for a very long time in segregation. In some cases, they demanded limitations on what people could say or read or associate with after they were released. All of this tended to undermine their case. So when the president campaigned on this issue, I think a lot of people wanted to see this chapter closed, and he certainly did that. I mean, this was broader than most people expected or even asked for.\n\nTrump signed pardons for approximately 1,500 defendants who were charged with crimes stemming from the riot at the U.S. Capitol, fulfilling a promise he made in December to act quickly and pardon them.\n\nTrump also commuted the sentences of six people on Monday, including the leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups.\n\n\"Tonight I'm going to be signing on the J6 hostages, pardons to get them out,\" Trump said at the parade at Capital One Arena in Washington. \"I'm going to the Oval Office, and we'll be signing pardons for a lot of people.\"\n\nThe Justice Department reported that approximately 140 police officers were assaulted during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. That included law enforcement members from both the U.S. Capitol Police and about 60 from the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nSo far, judges or a jury after a trial have convicted roughly 250 people who faced charges for their involvement in the riot, and more than 1,000 had pleaded guilty to crimes as of January.\n\nFox News' Diana Stancy contributed to this report.",

Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Todd Young, R-Indiana are urging historical museums in Washington, D.C., to \"respect\" the First Amendment rights of pro-life protesters who are expected to descend upon the city on Friday.\n\n\"This peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights has historically provided participants with a positive, welcoming experience in our nation\u2019s capital,\" the senators wrote in a letter to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\n\nTwo years ago, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum booted several Catholic students and their chaperones for wearing pro-life attire. Students and chaperones from Our Lady of the Rosary School in Greenville, South Carolina, traveled to Washington, D.C., to participate in the annual National March for Life. The group stood out in matching blue beanies emblazoned with the words \"Rosary PRO-LIFE.\"\n\nLEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD REACT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE RETURN\n\nAt the time, the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), representing some students' parents, claimed museum staff mocked the group, used expletives, and argued the museum was a \"neutral zone\" prohibiting political or religious messages.\n\nIn a settlement reached on March 18, 2024, the Smithsonian Institution resolved a lawsuit with students removed from the National Air and Space Museum for wearing pro-life beanies. As part of the agreement, the Smithsonian committed to providing the students a tour and an apology, updating its policy on clothing with religious and political speech for public-facing security staff, sharing video footage and investigative details of the incident, and paying $50,000.\n\nTRUMP PARDONS NEARLY EVERY JAN 6 DEFENDANT BUT SAYS HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED\n\n\"While we are pleased that the victims of this harassment received justice, it clearly never should have happened in the first place. No sum of money could truly undue the atrocious acts: officers bearing the badge and force of the federal government openly intimidated and violated the First Amendment rights of peaceful students,\" the senators wrote to the museums last week.\n\n\"Moreover, American taxpayers footed the bill for the Smithsonian Institution employees\u2019 egregious behavior and apparent lack of adequate training. This cannot happen again,\" they said.\n\nTRUMP TO DEPLOY MILITARY TO BORDER, END BIDEN PAROLE POLICIES IN FLURRY OF DAY ONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS\n\nThat same year, NARA settled a lawsuit in December 2023 after staff reportedly asked visitors to remove pro-life clothing during the March for Life protest earlier that year. The visitors, represented also by the ACLJ, claimed their First Amendment rights were violated. NARA apologized, admitted the incident breached its policies, and agreed to pay $10,000 in legal fees while implementing staff training to prevent future violations.\n\nThe senators are urging the institutions to answer questions about whether they have honored prior settlements regarding the treatment of visitors displaying religious or political messages and whether staff have been reminded of policies protecting free speech. NARA is also being asked to commit to maintaining these protections after a key injunction expires in January 2025. Both agencies have been asked to provide detailed explanations of their actions and preparations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an email to Fox News Digital, Smithsonian Institution spokesperson Pamela Baker-Masson said, \"We will correspond with the Senators.\"\n\nNARA did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline.",

                "text": "Four main observations from Trump's first two days as president\n\nDonald Trump's second full day as president has ended.\n\nIt feels like rather longer. Plenty has happened. This is the future.\n\nHe promised he'd get down to business and so he did. It's been hard to know which way to look, what to focus on.\n\nJoe Biden preferred short days. Trump chooses unpredictable days. He thrives on them; he thrives on surprise.\n\nSo here are a few observations from this whirlwind week so far:\n\nAccessible\n\nFirst, accessibility.\n\nFor all his seeming hatred and vilification of the media, President Trump has given the press far more access and opportunities to question him than his predecessor ever did.\n\nThat doesn't mean the answers he gives to the many questions thrown at him are always particularly meaningful, satisfactory or honest but we've already had two free-flowing news conferences.\n\nThere's been no aide selecting reporters to ask their questions.\n\nIt's just been Trump fielding the rowdy reporters' quickfire queries.\n\nLast night, inside the White House he responded to plenty of issues.\n\nOn the Ukraine question - he's talking to Zelenskyy he said and will meet with Putin \"anytime he wants\". Still, he offered no further detail on how he'd end the war.\n\nOn tariffs - he hinted how China and Mexico could avoid 25% levies on their goods.\n\nHe said the tariffs are \"because they are allowing fentanyl into our country\".\n\nStop the fentanyl and the tariffs go?\n\nOn the release of the January 6 convicts including the leader of the far-right Proud Boys - he suggested they could have a place in the political conversation.\n\nOn Elon Musk buying TikTok - \"If he wanted to buy it, yeah.\"\n\nHe looked like he was enjoying the back and forth. He was providing an open forum to probe him and, maybe, expose him.\n\nFact-checking\n\nSecond observation - fact-checking is still very much required for Trump.\n\nOn Monday he claimed that American warships must pay double tariffs to travel through the Panama Canal - not true, and that Chinese soldiers are 'operating' the canal - also not true.\n\nIn defending his decision to pardon the January 6 protesters, he claimed that murderers in America don't go to jail.\n\n\"They should not have served, and they've served years in jail. And murderers don't even go to jail in this country,\" he said.\n\nThis is a wildly misleading sidestep designed to distract from his decision to pardon 1,500 people.\n\nDifferent shades\n\nThird observation - we are already seeing the different shades of Trump.\n\nDeeply controversial announcements have come, with dizzying speed, but mixed with policy decisions many will see as pragmatic and sensible.\n\nThe investment in AI, combined no doubt with minimal regulation, could help scientists in healthcare research, make America much more competitive and boost the American energy sector.\n\nPositives and negatives there.\n\nHis intentionally unpredictable foreign policy is already yielding results, like the Gaza ceasefire, but his red lines are obscure to adversaries making miscalculations a risk.\n\nAnd his domestic agenda is proving already to be deeply controversial and perhaps even constitution-defying, setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nAmerican dominance\n\nFinal observation. Trump's unpredictability, volatility and transactional instincts are having immediate profound consequences.\n\nFar from being an increasingly irrelevant, declining nation, America feels - in just a few (long) days - to have become more powerful and more dominant than it has been for a very long time.\n\nThe necessity to dance to America's tune has never been greater.\n\nDonald Trump would have it no other way.\n\nWe must watch now for when someone chooses to test him.",

                "text": "Former staffers and members of the GMB union have launched an official complaint to the equalities watchdog this week over allegations of institutional sexism and bullying, Sky News understands.\n\nIn the complaint, which Sky News has seen, the women allege that there is a \"pattern of victimisation and harassment against women who speak out\" about wrongdoing inside the Labour-backed union. They argue it could be a breach of GMB's duties under the Equality Act.\n\nGMB has struggled with these issues before. Four years ago, a damning report written by Karon Monaghan KC branded the union 'institutionally sexist' and, according to a number of women complaining to the EHRC this week, they insist the union hasn't changed.\n\nIn Ms Monaghan's initial report she described \"bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment\" being rife inside the union and described the culture in GMB as \"heavy drinking and late-night socialising, salacious gossip and a lack of professionalism\".\n\nLast year, members in the Yorkshire and Humber region balloted to strike over complaints of bullying and harassment which have been staved off following the union's concession to invite Ms Monaghan back inside the union to investigate.\n\nBut now, a group of around a dozen former and current GMB staff have written to the equalities watchdog to demand an external investigation.\n\nOne of those women, Cath Pinder, a former regional president in the GMB North East who has been suspended and expelled from the union, though she is appealing these actions, said: \"They cannot be allowed to police themselves. It's really difficult to put your head above the parapet but when multiple people do it it shows an institutional problem.\"\n\nImage: Regional GMB officer Cath says GMB should not be allowed to police themselves.\n\nGMB represents about 630,000 workers in the UK and is one of the Labour party's major funders which makes the union's general secretary, Gary Smith, politically significant.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer gave the keynote speech at the GMB conference a year before the last general election and numerous cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are members.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nDangerous winds to hit UK\n\nTrump pardons 6 January rioters\n\nAt least 66 dead in hotel fire\n\nGMB - which donates more than \u00a31m to Labour every year - categorically denies claims of a culture of bullying or sexism within the union, and say Ms Pinder's suspension was justified.\n\nThey say the union responded to the Karon Monaghan report and now have clear, comprehensive and transparent procedures to fully investigate and effectively deal with any allegation of bullying, sexism or harassment.\n\nA GMB spokesperson said: \"Such behaviour has no place in GMB and is not tolerated under any circumstances. We do not use non-disclosure agreements and staff leaving the organisation are asked to sign standard settlement agreements, similar to those used by virtually every organisation across the public and private sectors.\"\n\nFor a union that prides itself on representing staff bullied or harassed in their own workplace, these women say they hope for that for GMB too - but they will have to take on their own union now to do it.",

                "text": "Where on Earth do you start with a stocks and shares ISA?\n\nFor this week's guide, Kirsty Stone, a chartered financial planner from The Private Office, tells us how to get started with a stocks and shares ISA...\n\nWhat is a stocks and shares ISA?\n\nThis is a type of ISA that you can use to invest in shares, funds, investment trusts or bonds.\n\nYou don't have to pay UK income tax or capital gains tax on money you earn from investments made through a stocks and shares ISA.\n\n\"You can contribute up to \u00a320,000 per year into your ISAs - this could include stocks and shares ISA, cash ISAs, lifetime ISAs or a combination, but it's important to remember that this limit applies across all ISAs you open in a single tax year,\" Stone says.\n\nWhat are the pros of having one?\n\n\"If you've been thinking about growing your savings and you have regular surplus income or capital set aside which is not needed in the short term, a stocks and shares ISA could be an option worth considering,\" Stone says.\n\n\"The beauty of an ISA is that the returns you earn are all tax-free, which can really help your money grow faster compared to regular savings accounts, where interest is often taxable - and so too are capital gains if you sell investments that are not held within a stocks and shares ISA wrapper.\"\n\nIf you have a medium or long-term savings goal, Stone says a stocks and shares ISA is worth considering over a cash ISA.\n\n\"Over the long term, investing in stocks and shares has traditionally provided better returns than leaving your money in a regular cash-based savings account,\" she explains.\n\n\"Historically, the stock market has offered stronger growth, especially if you're willing to invest for the long term (typically a minimum of 5, 10, or even 20 years). However, of course, like all investments, there are risks involved.\"\n\nWhat are the cons?\n\nUnlike a savings account where your money is guaranteed to grow either at a fixed or variable rate, a stocks and shares ISA is subject to market fluctuations.\n\nThis means that investment returns are not guaranteed and you may get back less than originally invested.\n\n\"The value of your investments can go up, but it can also go down, and in the short term, you have to be prepared to ride out these fluctuations,\" Stone says.\n\nMany investment platforms or providers also charge a fee to have a stocks and shares ISA, she adds, saying it is important to shop around and compare platforms.\n\nWhat can you do to get started?\n\nFor someone who hasn't invested before, Kirsty warns the world of investing can be very daunting - but you can seek independent financial advice from a professional to help you.\n\n\"For those who do not wish to do this, you'll need to decide what markets or assets to allocate your ISA contribution to, how to diversify it and how much risk you're comfortable taking with your investment,\" she says.\n\n\"If you're unsure about how to pick investments or feel intimidated by the choices available, you might find it helpful to start with a prebuilt portfolio by the company you choose to open your ISA account with.\"\n\nThese portfolios can factor in what level of investment risk you wish to take and any ethical or sustainable preferences you have with your savings.\n\nStone says: \"Often investing in a fund rather than an individual share of a company offers a greater level of diversification and lessens the risk of one individual company doing poorly as a fund will normally hold dozens of companies at any given time.\"\n\nIf you are already investing outside an ISA, Stone suggests considering switching to a stocks and shares ISA.\n\nUnlike pensions or other locked-in investment vehicles, you can withdraw your money whenever you need from a stocks and shares ISA, she says.\n\nThis is for general information only, does not constitute individual advice and should not be used to inform financial decisions.",

                "text": "Victims of domestic abuse are being failed by a criminal justice system that is not up to the job, a damning report by the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales has said.\n\nDame Nicole Jacobs warned the government's \"ambitious\" target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade will \"fall flat\" unless it addresses the criminal justice response to the issue.\n\nAround 2.3 million people suffered domestic abuse in the 12 months to last March, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, but the report said less than a fifth of victims report to police, because of a system \"ill-equipped to respond to the enormity of the challenge\".\n\nOf the 851,000 offences recorded by police in England and Wales during that period, less than 73,000 were referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and around 49,000 resulted in charges, leading to less than 39,000 offenders being found guilty.\n\nIn other words, the report said: \"Just 5% of police-recorded domestic abuse offences reach conviction; and less than a fifth of victims have the confidence to report to the police in the first place. Faith in the system is at an all-time low.\"\n\nDame Nicole told Sky News victims were being let down \"time and time again\".\n\n\"We're missing so many opportunities to use the tools that we do have - protection orders, the advocacy, support and advice - that we could signpost victims to at the earliest time,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"Some of the statistics that stand out in my mind, I mean, they're shocking throughout the whole report, I have to say.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:03 June 2024: Domestic abuse cases in the UK\n\nThe report says charge and conviction volumes remain \"unacceptably low\", and victims' lack of confidence \"is compounded by a series of systemic failures across the criminal justice response to domestic abuse\".\n\n\"The system is unable to cope with demands placed upon it, and specialist domestic abuse services - who play a vital role in bolstering this system - remain critically underfunded,\" it said.\n\nCourt delays, early release from prison, poor enforcement of protective orders, and falling convictions are \"symptomatic\" of these failings, the report said, and \"well-documented examples of police-perpetrated domestic abuse further undermine confidence in the justice system\".\n\nThe commissioner noted an \"alarming\" new figure that just 4% of alleged domestic abuse perpetrators in the police were dismissed over the 12 months to the end of March 2024.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nOut of almost 1,300 allegations of police-perpetrated domestic abuse (PPDA), concerning 899 individuals within the police workforce, the \"vast majority resulted in 'no case to answer', 'suspension' and 'learning outcomes'\", she said.\n\nAmong its recommendations, the report called for an overhaul of data, urging investment in new technology.\n\nRead more:\n\nMale abuse survivors 'ignored'\n\nEx-Scotland rugby captain avoids jail\n\nMinisters, it said, must ensure specialist domestic abuse support is resourced, calling for an annual investment of just under \u00a3188m to set up \"by and for\" organisations that \"support black and minoritised, deaf and disabled, and LGBT+ survivors\".\n\nAccountability could be strengthened, it said, via Local Criminal Justice Boards and a new national scrutiny panel, while the status of working in the domestic abuse field, especially within the police, needed to be strengthened also.\n\nTraining for criminal justice system staff to help them recognise possible victims and greater access to self-defence for victims who use force against their abuser were other demands while the Ministry of Justice was urged to provide a defence where victims of domestic abuse are coerced into offending.\n\nChief Constable Sir Andy Marsh, chief executive at the College of Policing, welcomed the report, and added: \"I am pleased that the work we are doing at the College of Policing to better professionalise public protection, alongside the strengthening of policing vetting processes, align so well with the report's asks, but I recognise that there is much more that we must - and will - do.\"\n\nAnthony Rogers, HM chief inspector of the CPS Inspectorate, said the system struggled to cope with demands placed on it.\n\n\"In previous inspections we have commented that specialist domestic abuse services - who play a vital role - are critically underfunded,\" he said.\n\n\"The domestic abuse commissioner's report sets out clear recommendations that if addressed will help turn what is a fragmented service into one that will help victims as they deal with the one of the most traumatic experiences that they will face.\"\n\nThe Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, Jess Phillips, said: \"The findings are stark and serve as further proof of what we recognise - that fundamental and systemic change is needed.\n\n\n\n\"Over the last 6 months we have taken a number of bold first steps to address these issues, launching new Domestic Abuse Protection Orders in select areas and announcing plans to embed domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms under Raneem's Law.\n\n\n\n\"But we know this is just the start, and we must go further. We will not stop until we have a system that protects victims, supports their journey to justice, and holds perpetrators to account - part of our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade and wider Plan for Change.\"",

Pic: Merseyside Police\n\nThe manual was found at his home a couple of days after the attack, but he wasn't charged with the terror offence for another three months.\n\nAgain, easy to see why some people cried \"cover-up\".\n\nWhen asked about his decision to withhold information about the Southport attacker by Sky News political editor Beth Rigby, Sir Keir said he knew details about Rudakubana, as they were emerging, but it \"would not have been right to disclose\" them.\n\nIt's easier to understand why other details of the police investigation were not revealed.\n\nThat's normal when there is expected to be a criminal trial in which a jury must decide its verdict purely on what it hears in court, untainted by anything it might have heard or read before.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:58 Southport: Did PM withhold info?\n\nRead more:\n\n'Nothing off the table in Southport inquiry'\n\nMissed opportunities to stop Southport killer\n\nHow people of Southport are trying to make sense of horror\n\nThe traditional media usually sticks to that rule because to flout it could land journalists in prison for breaching the Contempt of Court Act 1981.\n\nA lot of information has emerged since Rudakubana pleaded guilty to murder on Monday, scrapping the need for a trial, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has still stopped some known details being published ahead of Thursday's sentencing.\n\nOf course, many social media users aren't aware of, or simply don't care about, the contempt laws and post in ignorance or malevolence some vital facts - plus the rumours and gossip - the rest of us have to keep schtum about.\n\nJurors are always warned to forget anything they read or hear outside the courtroom.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It's stuck in my head.\n\n\"He came down here and if I'd have known what was going to transpire after that, he wouldn't have left his yard.\"\n\nColin said he has struggled with the possibility he could have done something: \"We all have. It's all ifs and buts and it goes without saying had we seen anything or had we known, he wouldn't have been doing what he did next door.\"\n\nAs the attack unfolded, Colin raced to the Hart Space and saw the victims running in terror. He called 999.\n\nHe still has nightmares and flashbacks.\n\nImage: Rudakubana pleaded guilty this week. Pic: Merseyside Police\n\n\"You just don't know what we walked into,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope we saved some lives that day with what we did and our quick reactions, but there's devastation that we lost three of them, and they were only young kids - little baby girls really - and no one should do that.\"\n\nThe fate of six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, is now woven into the fabric of Hart Street. The trauma of that day is still palpable.\n\nImage: (L-R) Victims Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva Aguiar\n\nOne woman - who helped shield children that day - spoke for many in questioning why so much focus is now on the attacker.\n\n\"Why is it all about him?\" she said. \"Three girls died.

I'd stay away from it. But I've got to come here. My business is here and I've got to carry on.\"\n\nThere is relief for many that they will not have to relive the horrors in court - Colin was due to give evidence on his birthday.\n\nLike many on Hart Street, he has heard the now national conversion about the attacker's past. He wants the lessons to be learned but his thoughts are with the families.\n\n\"It is all too late,\" he said.",

                "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said \"Britain faces a new threat\" and terrorism has changed in light of the Southport attack last summer.\n\nSpeaking the day after Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted murdering three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class, the prime minister said \"terrorism has changed\" at a news conference in Downing Street.\n\n\"In the past, the predominant threat was highly organised groups with clear political intent. Groups like al Qaeda. That threat, of course, remains,\" he said.\n\n\"But now, alongside that, we also see acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety, sometimes inspired by traditional terrorist groups, but fixated on that extreme violence seeming only for its own sake.\"\n\nPolitics latest: PM takes on claims of 'cover-up' over Southport attack\n\nHe added: \"If a law needs to change to recognise this new and dangerous threat, then we will change it and quickly, and we will also review our entire counter-extremist system to make sure we have what we need to defeat it.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:57 Southport murderer - what you need to know\n\nThe PM announced Sir David Anderson KC, an independent reviewer of terror legislation, has been appointed as the new independent commissioner for Prevent, the UK's anti-extremism scheme.\n\nAfter his guilty plea, it emerged Rudakubana was referred to the Prevent scheme three times in the 17 months before the attack over concerns about his fixation with violence but a judgement was made that he did not require intervention.\n\nWhat is anti-terrorism programme Prevent? The aim of Prevent is to \"stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism\". The government-led, multi-agency scheme also helps to rehabilitate and disengage those who are already involved in terrorism, and safeguard communities from threats. Referrals to Prevent lead to a \"gateway assessment\", made by specialist police officers to determine whether there are \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect the person is \"susceptible to becoming a terrorist or supporting terrorism\". The individual will then receive tailored support to reduce their susceptibility to being radicalised into terrorism, if appropriate. The Prevent programme has three main aims: \u2022 To tackle the ideological causes of terrorism; \u2022 Intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation; \u2022 Enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage and rehabilitate.\n\nSir Keir said the Southport killings \"must be a line in the sand for Britain\" and there must be \"fundamental change\" in how the country protects its children.\n\n\"The senseless barbaric murder of three young girls in Southport is a devastating moment in our history. No words come anywhere close to expressing the brutality and horror in this case,\" he said.\n\nHours after Rudakabana's guilty plea, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced an inquiry into the stabbings would take place.\n\nSir Keir said an inquiry was needed \"because we are dealing with a new cohort, a new different threat, this individualised extreme violence\".\n\nHe said the government would not wait until the inquiry finished before making changes, adding: \"We need to get on with the change in the meantime and to reassure the public that every step has been taken to protect their children.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Southport is trying to make sense of horror\n\nMugshot of Southport attacker released\n\nImage: Keir Starmer\n\n'I would never disclose details that could collapse a trial'\n\nThe prime minister also said he knew Rudakubana was known to the authorities and referred to Prevent when the attacks happened, but he could not reveal that at the time because it risked collapsing the trial.\n\n\"The vile individual who committed these crimes would have walked away, a free man, the prospect of justice destroyed for the victims and their families,\" he said.\n\n\"I would never do that, and nobody would ever forgive me if I had. That is why the law of this country forbade me or anyone else from disclosing details sooner.\"\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

                "text": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called tariffs \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary.\u201d That is not how other world leaders and CEOs see it. If Trump follows through on his proposal to impose 60 percent tariffs on China and 20 percent on other countries, the potential for disruption and chaos is significant.\n\nBut beyond the short-term pain, is there a positive case to be made for tariffs? And if so, what would it be? Enter the conservative economist Oren Cass, the founder of the increasingly influential think tank American Compass. A cast of rising Republican figures, including Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, have amplified Cass\u2019s work diagnosing the harms inflicted on the American heartland through free trade and globalization. Cass also contributed to Project 2025, the conservative policy tome that looked to shape the Trump 2.0 agenda.\n\nCass doesn\u2019t speak for Trump and doesn\u2019t seem to be seeking a role in the next administration. But Trump\u2019s disruption of the status quo has created room to elevate Cass\u2019s ideas\u2014especially as a new generation of Republican politicians step up to shape policy. I spoke with Cass on FP Live about Trump\u2019s economic plans. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript.\n\nRavi Agrawal: I want to have a broad conversation about the American economy, but let\u2019s start with tariffs. U.S. tariffs have consistently fallen from the 1940s to about 2016, when Trump was elected for the first time. Explain to us what the reversal of this trend is solving for.\n\nOren Cass: The problem we\u2019ve seen over that full period, but really over the last 25 years or so\u2014especially since China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization [in 2001]\u2014is that free trade has not worked at all how most economists predicted. There was a great deal of noise about how all economists unanimously predicted that free trade with China would be a wonderful benefit for the United States, its workers, and the strength of its economy. We lowered tariffs and lowered barriers on that basis. We have not seen the benefits that were promised. In many cases, we\u2019ve seen the reverse. Certainly, we do have more cheap stuff in the United States, but I think the vast majority of Americans would rightly say it has not, on net, been beneficial.\n\nAnd so we have this conflict now where a lot of economists are still using those exact same models from 25 years ago. And unsurprisingly, those models that say free trade is a wonderful benefit also say going in the other direction would have costs that exceed the benefits. Once you realize and admit that those previous models were wrong, that they got the trade-off backward, you can\u2019t continue to use those models to argue against less free trade. You have to recognize that less free trade is going to benefit the people. We need to be focused on those who have been left behind.\n\nRead more",

With an April 1 deadline for nearly all the reviews and investigations, the clock is already ticking for early administration action on Trump's punitive trade agenda.\n\nIn U.S. President Donald Trump's avalanche of day-one executive orders, he did not drop the gauntlet on the start of the next trade war, much to the temporary relief of markets and currency traders, as well as Canada and Mexico , which received almost an eight-hour reprieve before he threatened them , too.\n\nIn U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s avalanche of day-one executive orders, he did not drop the gauntlet on the start of the next trade war, much to the temporary relief of markets and currency traders, as well as Canada and Mexico, which received almost an eight-hour reprieve before he threatened them, too.\n\nBut his sweeping executive order on trade did lay the groundwork for all and more that he promised on the campaign trail, prompting agency reviews and investigations that are the necessary precursor for the broad tariffs on China and the rest of the world. With an April 1 deadline for nearly all the reviews and investigations, the clock is already ticking for early administration action on Trump\u2019s punitive trade agenda.\n\nThe executive order basically breaks down into China and the rest of the world. But there\u2019s one interesting difference from many of the other actions Trump took that explicitly rolled back Biden-era rules, regulations, and mandates: Some of the planned trade measures maintain and build upon trade actions that the Biden administration took, including to combat China\u2019s unfair trade practices and bolster U.S. export controls.\n\nParts of the executive order go after a particular obsession that Trump and his trade braintrust have: searching for a problem for which they already have the solution (more tariffs, of course).\n\nFirst, Trump directed his administration to figure out why the U.S. trade deficit in goods just keeps getting bigger and to come up with some convincing reason why that is a national security risk, since economists and trade experts are blas\u00e9 about what is essentially an accounting metric. That review opens the door to global tariffs\u2014i.e., import duties on every other country\u2014through the Carter-era International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nSecond, Trump ordered a root-and-branch review of the U.S. industrial and manufacturing base to determine which imports might possibly affect national security and could thus be subject to their own punitive tariffs under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. (Trump used that exact tool to hike tariffs on steel and aluminum on national security grounds in his first term, but he\u2019s thinking bigger this time.)\n\nThe other not-entirely-about-China elements in the trade executive order are other usual suspects, including ordering further investigations into countries that may manipulate their currencies for trade advantage and a review of arcane de minimis customs rules that create a loophole for lots of small-value trade to sneak past his tariff dragnet. Trump also promised a review and perhaps expansion of Biden-era restrictions on technology exports and opened the door to further restrictions on Chinese \u201cconnected\u201d technology, such as electric vehicles, which the Biden administration already flagged as a potential national security risk.\n\nBut much of the executive order goes specifically after China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and the United States\u2019 third-biggest trade partner. Cherishing hope over experience, Trump ordered an appraisal of his underwhelming Phase One trade deal with China to find out if Beijing complied with its terms (it did not), and he raised the specter of punitive tariffs.\n\nTrump also builds on the Biden administration\u2019s latest investigation into China\u2019s unfair trade practices under the authorities of Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, promising to look at the entire industrial supply chain and especially third countries who offer Beijing a way to sidestep China-specific tariffs. (That\u2019s bad news for countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia, not to mention Mexico, which rerouted a lot of China-U.S. bound trade and are now in the crosshairs.)\n\nHe also ordered the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to take its own look at China\u2019s unfair trade practices\u2014that means, in practice, a cheap yuan, industrial subsidies, dumping, intellectual property theft, market discrimination, and the like\u2014and to use its own sweeping authority to impose\u2014you guessed it\u2014tariffs. Just for good measure, the executive order vowed to assess ongoing legislative efforts to strip China of its current preferential trade relations with the United States, a step that would automatically open the door to higher tariffs.\n\nTrump campaigned on raising taxes on U.S. businesses and consumers through import levies as a way to rebalance what he and his trade advisors see as an unbalanced trade relationship with the world. What he did on his first day in office sets that process in motion, leaving just enough time for talks with targeted countries that could deliver the deals of a lifetime\u2014or herald a new threat to global trade and growth.",

                "text": "The highlights this week: U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s extension offer for TikTok to find a new buyer leaves the app\u2019s future up to China, Taiwan faces a constitutional crisis in the wake of three controversial laws passed in December, and Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks to Trump on the phone\u2014and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWelcome to Foreign Policy\u2019s China Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s extension offer for TikTok to find a new buyer leaves the app\u2019s future up to China, Taiwan faces a constitutional crisis in the wake of three controversial laws passed in December, and Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks to Trump on the phone\u2014and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSign up to receive China Brief in your inbox every Tuesday.\n\nTikTok\u2019s Future Is Up to the CCP\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, newly ensconced in the White House, has offered Chinese-owned social media app TikTok a 75-day extension to find a buyer. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law demanding its parent company, ByteDance, sell the platform; it went into effect on Jan. 19.\n\nTikTok went offline in the United States late on Jan. 19 and resumed service less than 24 hours later on Inauguration Day, with a message of thanks to Trump. What matters now isn\u2019t TikTok\u2019s decisions, but those of ByteDance\u2014and ByteDance, as a Chinese company, can\u2019t make independent decisions on a matter of geopolitical import by itself.\n\nThat means that TikTok\u2019s future is up to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and how China\u2019s leaders respond could offer some important clues for the near-term future of the U.S.-China relationship.\n\nTrump\u2019s extension offer is dubiously legal. The law allowed for a 90-day extension if there was progress toward a deal before it took effect. Oracle, TikTok\u2019s server host in the United States, seems to be betting that Trump\u2019s move won\u2019t be challenged in court. Other firms that could face fines are less certain, which is why TikTok hasn\u2019t returned to Apple\u2019s App Store or Google Play.\n\nSo, what happens next? One scenario is that a deal is put together in the next 75 days, and ByteDance sells TikTok to a U.S. company or another foreign buyer.\n\nThis would be the smartest approach on China\u2019s part, and it would also mean that Beijing is able to take advantage of Trump\u2019s cupidity in a way that it wasn\u2019t during his first term. Trump has always been open to deals, but China made no offers amid the downward spiral of the bilateral relationship post-2016.\n\nA deal along the lines that Trump has laid out vaguely\u2014where \u201cthe United States of America own[s] 50 percent of TikTok\u201d\u2014could leave Beijing effectively in control of the app\u2019s data and likely its content algorithms, if the other half remains in the hands of ByteDance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, TikTok could be used to promote right-wing propaganda in the United States if it doesn\u2019t touch on China. This would show that Beijing\u2019s understanding of U.S. politics has grown\u2014that officials were willing to block a sale until the new administration offered a better deal, rather than seeing both former President Joe Biden and Trump as part of continued hostility toward China.\n\nEven an outright sale of TikTok to a Trump ally would indicate that China is willing to offer deals that appeal to Trump\u2019s personal interests in return for concessions elsewhere, whether that is over Taiwan\u2019s security, expansionism in the South China Sea, or trade deals.\n\nBefore the inauguration, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng met with both U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Elon Musk\u2014who Beijing is rumored to have considered as a potential TikTok buyer. Still, the conversation might have been about the future of Musk\u2019s Tesla factories in China and tariffs. Regardless, China seems to see Musk as a useful backdoor.\n\nHowever, it still seems unlikely to me that China is ready to order ByteDance to sell TikTok. Chinese official statements and state media are still hostile to the idea, and there is institutional reluctance in Beijing to trust Trump. Marxist theory\u2014at least as the CCP interprets it\u2014offers little room for understanding such a chaotic figure, preferring to see him as an instrument of wider political forces.\n\nIf there is no sale, it is possible that Trump\u2014eager to keep a major social media platform on his side\u2014attempts to force the issue anyway. He could pressure congressional Republicans to rescind the TikTok ban with a new law or offer future extensions despite the law\u2019s text. Even before the law took effect, right-wing content was already booming on the app.\n\nThe law passed overwhelmingly last year, but it\u2019s possible that new pressure from Trump and from Democrats such as California Rep. Ro Khanna, who are eager to appeal to Big Tech, could force through a new bill that would cancel out the old one. Either way, the legal uncertainty would likely last for months, reinforcing the Chinese leadership\u2019s convictions that Washington is an inherently unreliable partner.\n\nThe last option is that a frustrated Trump allows the ban to be enforced, setting the tone for further confrontations with China. This would strengthen the idea of Washington\u2019s implacable hostility toward Beijing and probably render operations even more difficult for U.S. firms within China\u2019s borders.\n\nUltimately, that is the only option that doesn\u2019t create a clash inside the Trump administration between sincere China hawks and the president\u2019s more transactional backers. In private group chats, Republican intelligence and security staffers are already expressing anger about images of TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew sitting next to director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard at the inauguration.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton and Sen. Pete Ricketts, among others, have already spoken out against any concessions to ByteDance. Newly anointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been silent, but given his past positions, it\u2019s unlikely that he supports Trump\u2019s extension. All of this foreshadows future (and perhaps more serious) clashes if Trump tries to strike bargains with Beijing.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nTaiwan\u2019s constitutional crisis. The Taiwanese government is facing a major crisis after the passage of three controversial bills in its parliament, the Legislative Yuan, last December. The Legislative Yuan is controlled by the opposition party, Kuomintang (KMT), which is generally seen as pro-China; the Democratic Progressive Party holds the presidency.\n\nThe laws made major changes to Taiwan\u2019s Constitutional Court, which would normally require the court itself to decide on their legitimacy. But the court is currently paralyzed, since the KMT has blocked the appointment of new judges, leaving it with just eight out of 15\u2014not enough to reach the two-thirds quorum that the new laws demand.\n\nTaiwanese politics is contentious, with disagreement in the Legislative Yuan sometimes delving into physical fights. But the intensity of the latest clash, especially as the parliament attempts to slash President Lai Ching-te\u2019s proposed budget, is unusual. Taiwan is already struggling to show that it can defend itself against China; prolonged crisis could empower hawks in Beijing.\n\nXi\u2019s phone calls. Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s first conversation with Trump since 2021\u2014held on Jan. 17 before the U.S. president took office\u2014went relatively smoothly. Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs against China have not materialized\u2014though it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s because he\u2019s trying to bargain with Beijing or because of opposition among his business allies.\n\nNotably, Xi\u2019s conversation with Trump was followed by a much longer call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Jan. 21, emphasizing Beijing\u2019s de facto alliance with Moscow. The two calls are a reminder that U.S.-China relations are now tangled up with Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, where China has provided both rhetorical backing and material aid.\n\nTrump could seek a grand autocratic deal to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war on terms favorable to Putin, but many Republican hawks have emphasized China\u2019s role in the war and might be unhappy with any attempt at a bargain.\n\nFP\u2019s Most Read This Week\n\nTech and Business\n\nByteDance dilemmas. It\u2019s not just TikTok that is banned from U.S. app stores, but a wide range of parent company ByteDance\u2019s products. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of TikTok users have shifted over to Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media app, which is now struggling to make sure that new accounts are properly censored.\n\nLike all successful Chinese businesses, Xiaohongshu has extensive ties to the CCP, which raises the bigger question: Do bans on individual apps or companies make sense, given the demands that Beijing makes of every firm? Or will the United States move toward rules like those of India, where there is a broad ban of Chinese apps?\n\nChina has effectively walled off its internet from the rest of the world. Does the United States\u2019 internet need to be walled off from China, or are Americans confident in an era of domestic and foreign disinformation that the best speech will win out?\n\nGDP growth targets lowered. A tone of pessimism\u2014or realism\u2014has settled within Chinese local governments, with half of them setting lower GDP growth targets for 2025 compared to last year. (The average growth target is 5.26 percent; in 2024, it was 5.41 percent.) The central government will announce an overall growth target on March 5, and it is likely to hover around 5 percent.\n\nChinese provincial GDP figures always exceed those of the central government: Local leaders are judged in part on their success in boosting GDP, and Chinese statistics are highly unreliable. Even the dampened targets might still be unrealistic as the Chinese economy struggles to find a post-COVID foothold and local governments face a massive fiscal crisis.",

Cartels already face U.S. economic sanctions. But with an FTO designation, Washington would also be able to penalize any entity that \u201cknowingly provides material support or resources\u201d to the cartels in question\u2014potentially impacting migrants, farms, U.S. gun dealers, and more.\n\nIn a press briefing on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stressed the country\u2019s sovereignty and noted the importance of having a \u201ccool head.\u201d \u201cWe all want to fight the drug cartels,\u201d she said. The United States \u201cin their territory, us in our territory.\u201d\n\nTo understand the broader implications of Trump\u2019s FTO executive order, Foreign Policy spoke with Vanda Felbab-Brown, the director of the Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors at the Brookings Institution. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nForeign Policy: Trump has signed an executive order saying the United States will designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Is this a big deal?\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown: Yes, it\u2019s a very big deal. It has vast implications for both the operations against the cartels and very many issues beyond\u2014because along with the designations, the material support clauses kick in, and they are enormously capacious and allow prosecutorial action in a vast set of domains, including with respect to migration.\n\nIt also has implications for trade and economic activity across the border and beyond. Any entity that engages [with or] provides any kind of material support to the cartels anywhere in the world is in violation of U.S. laws, can be sanctioned and denied access to the U.S. banking system, and can face very significant prison and financial penalties.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not enough to say: \u201cWe did not know that we were selling alcohol to cartel members.\u201d It\u2019s not enough to resort to duress clauses. The presumption of due diligence, the burden of due diligence, is on the entity that\u2019s engaging with the cartels.\n\nFP: So this extends far beyond the cartels, economically.\n\nVFB: Absolutely. So, if you think of what\u2019s happening in Mexico, very many businesses pay extortion fees to the cartels. They would be in violation of U.S. laws.\n\nAnd so the U.S. prosecution could choose to go after any Mexican entity that trades in the U.S., or sells in the U.S., and also pays money to the cartels. But it could similarly go after U.S. entities.\n\nSo imagine a scenario where a Mexican company is paying extortion fees to the cartels. Could be, say, an avocado producer is paying extortion fees to the cartels, and then they are exporting to the U.S. The U.S. can go after them for material support clauses, but it could also go after the supermarkets in the U.S. that are buying those avocados.\n\nMost likely the supermarkets would say, \u201cLook, we didn\u2019t know that our Mexican supplier is paying extortion fees.\u201d But this could have hampering effects on trade or on economic integration because of the legal uncertainty that this introduces and the vast punishments that come with that designation.\n\n[It\u2019s unclear to me] how much the Trump team has thought through those economic implications. It\u2019s also quite possible that the Trump team is not particularly bothered that this could reduce trade across the border. After all, here is President Trump announcing that the 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada will kick in by Feb. 1, which is a revolutionary move undoing four decades of North American integration. So they might be very bothered about the economic implications, or they might just assume that they are not going to move to that prosecutorial action. But the capaciousness of the material support clauses is immense.\n\nIt also has implications for migration. The vast majority of migrants who come to the U.S. across the U.S.-Mexico border at some point have to pay fees to the cartels, whether this is for smuggling or ransom because they\u2019re being kidnapped, held hostage, and their families have to pay ransom.\n\nBut the moment they do it, they are violating material support clauses and hence can be denied asylum in the U.S. And, yes, there is the possibility of arguing duress, but the duress exception is quite flimsy and has often not been adequate in U.S. courts.\n\nSo, by declaring the cartels FTOs, the Trump administration has created a tool by which they can deny asylum for the vast majority of applicants seeking asylum or other kinds of legal status, as long as they can document that the money to the cartels has been paid.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not easy for U.S. prosecution to document, but it is really a very powerful tool. I should also say that it also has big implications for U.S. government assistance, where the U.S. has to really become doubly diligent in making sure that no U.S. money ends up in the hands of the cartels, which is very difficult. And it\u2019s not just money\u2014the material support can be a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a pencil, a toy.\n\nIn every large city, Mexican cartels operate, and they extort people\u2014they force people to do things. The U.S. now has to be extremely careful that any money that it spends does not end up in the hands of the cartels, which is almost impossible to do. So this has a big dampening effect on any kind of U.S. assistance.\n\nAnd then there is, of course, the military aspect, where the relationship between the FTO designation and the possibility of military action is not straightforward.\n\nThe FTO designation doesn\u2019t automatically guarantee or imply military action, but it makes it more likely. So, as long as the military action\u2014drone strike, airstrike, special operations forces\u2014is limited in duration, nature, and scope, the president can do it without prior authorization or declaration of the U.S. Congress.\n\nIn the absence of a military strike, the FTO designation now allows much greater engagement of the U.S. military, such as in terms of intelligence gathering.\n\nFP: Is the goal of this kind of designation to isolate the cartels economically? Is that the aim here?\n\nVFB: Well, who knows? In terms of the sanction capacity and not being able to access U.S. financial assistance, that already was in place in the absence of the designation.\n\nObviously, the cartels want their money, but you don\u2019t really have any larger sanctioning capacity against the cartels directly. What you have is much larger sanctioning capacities against anyone engaging with them.\n\nBut how is the U.S. going to enforce it? How are you going to be enforcing that people who live under the gun of the cartels are not paying money to them?\n\nIn the first Trump administration, [Trump] badly wanted the FTO designation. Ultimately, they pulled back from it because the Mexican government was strongly opposed and Trump had established enough of a relationship with [former Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador] that L\u00f3pez Obrador was halting the flows of migrants to the U.S. border. They were concerned that this would alienate L\u00f3pez Obrador, and so they did not designate.\n\nThe current Mexican government is still definitely opposed to the designation, but Trump went ahead and did it.\n\nFP: From your research, should drug cartels be seen or treated as foreign terrorist organizations? Would you say that\u2019s an accurate depiction or designation?\n\nVFB: If one thinks about the legal justification, I think it\u2019s possible. But one needs to think about what this means in terms of policy, and more often than not, the policy gets really tangled up in knots by that designation.\n\nIt does give some important authorities to the U.S., but how is the U.S. going to exercise this authority? What is going to be accomplished out of reducing trade with Mexico? Also, given the enormity of extortion, how are you going to pick your prosecution targets?\n\nThis has significant implications for the conduct of U.S. policy and often just ties up U.S. policy in knots.\n\nNow, the one most important thing that I would say the U.S. government can get out of it is to cajole the Mexican government into serious security cooperation and serious actions against the cartels.\n\nDuring the L\u00f3pez Obrador years\u2014during the Biden administration and Trump administration\u2014we saw essentially a complete halting of Mexico\u2019s law enforcement action against the cartels. The policy would be left with sporadic hits against high-value targets to placate the U.S., but they did little to disrupt the cartels\u2019 operation. And meanwhile, we saw the cartels tremendously expanding power over territories, institutions, and people in Mexico.\n\nNow the fact that [Trump has] designated them as FTOs is a big shot across the bow of the Mexican government. And I think that you have a possibility to get seriously tough with the Mexican government and bargain and that there is a resurrection of [the kind of] cooperation that took place during the Merida Initiative.\n\nSo I could envision how the FTO designation, the possibility of unilateral military strikes, and the threat of the economic tariffs can be used for that kind of bargaining.",

                "text": "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called tariffs \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary.\u201d That is not how other world leaders and CEOs see it. If Trump follows through on his proposal to impose 60 percent tariffs on China and 20 percent on other countries, the potential for disruption and chaos is significant.\n\nBut beyond the short-term pain, is there a positive case to be made for tariffs? And if so, what would it be? Enter the conservative economist Oren Cass, the founder of the increasingly influential think tank American Compass. A cast of rising Republican figures, including Vice President-elect J.D. Vance and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio, have amplified Cass\u2019s work diagnosing the harms inflicted on the American heartland through free trade and globalization. Cass also contributed to Project 2025, the conservative policy tome that looked to shape the Trump 2.0 agenda.\n\nCass doesn\u2019t speak for Trump and doesn\u2019t seem to be seeking a role in the next administration. But Trump\u2019s disruption of the status quo has created room to elevate Cass\u2019s ideas\u2014especially as a new generation of Republican politicians step up to shape policy. I spoke with Cass on FP Live about Trump\u2019s economic plans. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript.\n\nRavi Agrawal: I want to have a broad conversation about the American economy, but let\u2019s start with tariffs. U.S. tariffs have consistently fallen from the 1940s to about 2016, when Trump was elected for the first time. Explain to us what the reversal of this trend is solving for.\n\nOren Cass: The problem we\u2019ve seen over that full period, but really over the last 25 years or so\u2014especially since China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization [in 2001]\u2014is that free trade has not worked at all how most economists predicted. There was a great deal of noise about how all economists unanimously predicted that free trade with China would be a wonderful benefit for the United States, its workers, and the strength of its economy. We lowered tariffs and lowered barriers on that basis. We have not seen the benefits that were promised. In many cases, we\u2019ve seen the reverse. Certainly, we do have more cheap stuff in the United States, but I think the vast majority of Americans would rightly say it has not, on net, been beneficial.\n\nAnd so we have this conflict now where a lot of economists are still using those exact same models from 25 years ago. And unsurprisingly, those models that say free trade is a wonderful benefit also say going in the other direction would have costs that exceed the benefits. Once you realize and admit that those previous models were wrong, that they got the trade-off backward, you can\u2019t continue to use those models to argue against less free trade. You have to recognize that less free trade is going to benefit the people. We need to be focused on those who have been left behind.\n\nRead more",

                "text": "During his first term, Trump froze the bank accounts and restricted travel of the chief ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and a deputy. With great forbearance, they largely turned the other cheek. President Joe Biden lifted the sanctions after he assumed office.\n\nOn his first day back in office, U.S. President Donald Trump took the first step toward possibly renewing the sanctions that he imposed against senior International Criminal Court (ICC) personnel during his first presidency. The last time, Trump incurred public outrage but nothing more. This time, he could find himself criminally charged\u2014creating a headache and risk almost every time that he travels internationally.\n\nOn his first day back in office, U.S. President Donald Trump took the first step toward possibly renewing the sanctions that he imposed against senior International Criminal Court (ICC) personnel during his first presidency. The last time, Trump incurred public outrage but nothing more. This time, he could find himself criminally charged\u2014creating a headache and risk almost every time that he travels internationally.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump froze the bank accounts and restricted travel of the chief ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and a deputy. With great forbearance, they largely turned the other cheek. President Joe Biden lifted the sanctions after he assumed office.\n\nBut in his flurry of executive orders on Inauguration Day this week, Trump reversed Biden\u2019s actions, enabling new sanctions to be imposed.\n\nTrump\u2019s original rationale for this extraordinary attempt to manipulate an independent institution of justice was two investigations that Bensouda had opened. One was in Afghanistan, which could have implicated George W. Bush-era interrogators, who are alleged by international observers to have performed some of their most grotesque torture there. The other investigation was on Palestine, which threatened Israeli officials who have been accused of committing war crimes in Israeli-occupied territories.\n\nThe fact that neither the United States nor Israel had ratified the ICC treaty did not relieve their officials from potential prosecution for crimes committed in locations that had joined the court because the institution has territorial jurisdiction.\n\nSince then, a new chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has taken the reins of the ICC. In Afghanistan, he has prioritized investigations of the Taliban and the Islamic State, signaling that U.S. torturers likely have nothing to fear. But he has acted vigorously in Palestine, charging three now-deceased Hamas officials for crimes allegedly committed on and after Oct. 7, 2023, as well as charging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant under accusations of deliberately starving and depriving Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month adopted legislation authorizing sanctions against ICC officials because of the charges against these senior Israeli officials. Trump\u2019s reversal of Biden\u2019s executive order on the point suggests that he may soon be planning to act.\n\nThis comes amid a remarkable shift in the U.S. Republican Party\u2019s attitude toward the ICC. When Khan charged Russian President Vladimir Putin with the alleged war crime of abducting Ukrainian children, Republican leaders applauded and pledged their support, setting aside a long history of antagonism toward the court because of the theoretical risk that it could prosecute an American.\n\nBut that seemingly principled support was revealed to be selective and fleeting when the party turned on the court for charging Netanyahu and Gallant. If Trump imposes new sanctions on Khan, then the aim would be to force him to drop the charges against these senior Israeli officials, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged during his confirmation hearing.\n\nIf sanctions are imposed, Khan is unlikely to be as forgiving as Bensouda. Article 70 of the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, criminalizes \u201cimpeding\u201d or \u201cintimidating\u201d any court official to influence their official duties. Americans typically call this crime \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d Even though the United States never joined the court, Trump would be vulnerable to this charge because his actions would be directed at reversing the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant, over which the court has jurisdiction.\n\nIf fighting in Gaza resumes after the first six-week phase of the current cease-fire, and Trump continues to provide Israel with arms and military aid as it again bombs and starves Palestinian civilians, he could also be charged with aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes.\n\nKhan exercised restraint in not charging Biden for that alleged crime. But if Trump imposes sanctions on Khan, I suspect that the gloves would come off. (Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president, is serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison for aiding and abetting war crimes by providing arms to an abusive force.)\n\nTrump might try to slough off such charges in much the same way that he has his other criminal travails, but it would not be so easy. His pardon power does not extend to the ICC. There is no U.S. constitutional bar to international criminal charges against a sitting president.\n\nMore important, his international travel would suddenly be significantly restricted. All 125 ICC members, including all of the European Union, would be legally obliged to arrest him if he set foot on their soil. And even if handcuffs wouldn\u2019t necessarily be placed on him as he landed in Brussels, S\u00e3o Paulo, Johannesburg, or Tokyo, there is a strong likelihood that he would be quietly told not to come. Trump should ask Putin what it feels like suddenly to become such a global pariah.\n\nAs a matter of law, there is no question that these senior Israeli officials deserve prosecution. The trucks filled with aid that is flowing into Gaza following the start of the cease-fire on Jan. 19 illustrate the humanitarian relief that Israel could have been allowing but instead allegedly blocked for the bulk of the war, despite Israeli officials\u2019 regular and dubious denials.\n\nThe U.S. government has advanced certain procedural objections to the charges, but none hold water. The argument that Palestine is not enough of a state to have joined the court and confer jurisdiction, despite the United Nations General Assembly having voted overwhelmingly in 2012 to recognize it as a nonmember observer state, has been rejected twice by ICC pretrial chambers of judges.\n\nThe argument that the court should defer to good-faith Israeli efforts to prosecute its own alleged war criminals, under what is known as the ICC\u2019s principle of complementarity, is belied by the utter lack of any announced Israeli investigation, let alone prosecution, of anyone for the starvation strategy that the country is widely accused of using\u2014and indeed, of any senior Israeli official for any other alleged war crime in Gaza.\n\nTo the contrary, Netanyahu charged in May 2024 that \u201cKhan takes his place among the great antisemites in modern times,\u201d a typical statement of his cheapening of the genuine threat of antisemitism to try to deflect criticism of Israel.\n\nIn addition, the Guardian has reported that Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency threatened Bensouda\u2014the ICC former prosecutor\u2014and her husband. These allegations hardly reflect a good-faith effort to pursue possible war crimes.\n\nIsrael had every right to fight Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks, but it had no right to rip up the rules of international humanitarian law that are meant to minimize harm to civilians. Israel lost global sympathy because of these systematic war crimes.\n\nRather than seeking impunity for these atrocities by attacking the ICC, Trump\u2014who is eager for a comprehensive Middle East deal\u2014should press Netanyahu to abide by the rules. If he doesn\u2019t, then he risks a radically circumscribed world in which much of his travel\u2014whether for summits, state visits, or even to tour one of his golf courses\u2014is suddenly fraught or prohibited.",

To address border security, he ordered the deployment of troops; resumed construction of the border wall; reinstated the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, which forces asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico during immigration proceedings; and shut down the CBP One app, a Biden-era program that allowed some migrants to enter the United States legally through an appointment lottery system. Trump also designated cartels and foreign gangs as \u201cglobal terrorists\u201d in an effort to expand government efforts to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nIn addition, Trump directed federal agencies to stop recognizing birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants, a right guaranteed under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Attorneys general for 18 states, the city of San Francisco, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Tuesday challenging the order.\n\nTo drive home his America First approach, Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d implemented a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance, and signaled his intention to leave the World Health Organization within 12 months.\n\n\u201cWorld Health ripped us off. Everybody rips off the United States. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nTrump also ordered the United States to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement in a major blow to global efforts to limit climate change. Trump pulled out of the landmark deal in 2020, during his first term, only for his successor, Joe Biden, to reverse course. He has since vowed to eliminate Biden\u2019s so-called electric vehicle mandate and has promised to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d instead of investing in renewable energy. The United States is the second-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world.\n\nIn another controversial executive order, Trump instructed the U.S. attorney general not to take action to enforce the ban on TikTok for 75 days, despite the U.S. Supreme Court having upheld the law barring access to the popular social media app. That law went into effect on Sunday. Trump has suggested that he will convince Chinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell the app to a U.S. company. That executive order could also face challenges in court, including over whether the president has the authority to delay the enforcement of a federal law.\n\nAmong his other key actions, Trump ended diversity, equity, and inclusion-related programs in the federal government; rolled back protections for transgender Americans; declared a national energy emergency; and pardoned around 1,500 people convicted in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHe did not accomplish everything on his Day 1 to-do list, though. The Russia-Ukraine war still rages on, despite Trump promising to end the conflict by his inauguration. He did not issue sanctions on Iran, nor did he expand his controversial U.S. travel ban. And he has yet to impose sweeping 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, though he said those will begin on Feb. 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an executive order shock-and-awe campaign,\u201d political historian Matthew Dallek told the Washington Post, adding that the sheer number of presidential actions demonstrates how Trump is seeking an aggressive start to his second term.\n\nToday\u2019s Most Read\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nPrisoner exchange. Two U.S. citizens being held in Afghanistan were freed on Tuesday in exchange for a Taliban official imprisoned in California for drug trafficking and terrorism charges. The prisoner swap was brokered before Biden left office on Monday, but an unexpected delay (partly due to bad weather) pushed back the exchange. Qatar helped mediate the talks.\n\nThe Taliban heralded the deal on Tuesday as a step toward the \u201cnormalization\u201d of bilateral ties. But the likelihood of improved relations remains slim, especially as two other U.S. citizens are believed to still be held captive in Afghanistan. \u201cThe Trump Administration will continue to demand the release of all Americans held by the Taliban,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said.\n\nAnother senior Trump administration official who spoke to CNN took a more critical approach. \u201cWhile we would not do the deal that the Biden administration did at the end, we are always happy to have two Americans home,\u201d the official said.\n\nUnder questioning. During his impeachment trial on Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol denied ordering his military commanders to remove lawmakers from parliament during his six-hour martial law order last December. He reiterated his \u201cfirm commitment to free democracy\u201d and once again placed the blame on the country\u2019s opposition, which Yoon claims paralyzed the government to the point that it reached the brink of collapse.\n\nYoon was impeached on Dec. 14 for allegedly attempting an insurrection. Video footage from that day shows what appears to be military officers barricading or dragging parliamentarians out of the National Assembly. Yoon was arrested last Wednesday after a weekslong standoff, in which he refused to submit to questioning. Seoul\u2019s Constitutional Court must now determine whether to permanently remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.\n\nJenin raid. Israeli forces launched a major military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more. Netanyahu said the latest offensive was aimed at \u201ceradicating terrorism\u201d and would be \u201cextensive and significant,\u201d but he did not provide further details. The Palestinian Authority, which governs the territory, accused Israeli troops of firing on civilians.\n\nThe assault follows the signing of a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which allowed the return of three Israeli hostages in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners on Monday. And it comes less than 24 hours after Trump rescinded U.S. sanctions on dozens of far-right Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians and destroying their property in the West Bank.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Israeli military chief Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi resigned for failing to protect Israeli civilians from Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which killed around 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage, and sparked a devastating multifront war.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility for the terrible failure accompanies me every day, every hour, and will for the rest of my life,\u201d Halevi wrote. Defense Ministry Director-General Eyal Zamir is favored to replace Halevi.\n\nOdds and Ends\n\nWe all get a little lonely sometimes. When Japan\u2019s Kaikyokan Aquarium closed for renovations in December, the staff noticed that one of its sunfish had stopped eating. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out the cause and took various measures, but one of the staff members said, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s lonely because it misses the visitors?\u2019\u201d according to the aquarium. Sure enough, the creation of cardboard cutout people taped to the glass\u2014complete with aquarium uniforms\u2014did the trick, and the sunfish is back to happy swims.",

                "text": "When I first stayed with friends in Pacific Palisades about 20 years ago, I was amazed to see the daily rhythm of the residents leaving their homes during the day and an armada of housekeepers, contractors, and gardeners turning up to look after the houses, with the arrivals and departures reversing themselves in the evening. A lot of money has gone into these and other homes in Los Angeles, but Mother Nature has once again demonstrated that she\u2019s mightier than any celebrity\u2014and any politician for that matter.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t often feel sorry for the Hollywood stars and multimillionaires living in Pacific Palisades, but now may be such a time. Not only have many of the residents of the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood lost their homes\u2014a very significant percentage of them also stand to lose their home insurance. They are not alone. With geopolitics worsening, underwriters have for years been suspending insurance for politically linked risks, including doing business in countries such as Russia and China. Now, it seems, living in certain areas could become an uninsurable luxury, too.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t often feel sorry for the Hollywood stars and multimillionaires living in Pacific Palisades, but now may be such a time. Not only have many of the residents of the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood lost their homes\u2014a very significant percentage of them also stand to lose their home insurance. They are not alone. With geopolitics worsening, underwriters have for years been suspending insurance for politically linked risks, including doing business in countries such as Russia and China. Now, it seems, living in certain areas could become an uninsurable luxury, too.\n\nWhen I first stayed with friends in Pacific Palisades about 20 years ago, I was amazed to see the daily rhythm of the residents leaving their homes during the day and an armada of housekeepers, contractors, and gardeners turning up to look after the houses, with the arrivals and departures reversing themselves in the evening. A lot of money has gone into these and other homes in Los Angeles, but Mother Nature has once again demonstrated that she\u2019s mightier than any celebrity\u2014and any politician for that matter.\n\nThe Angelenos who have lost their homes or businesses, or whose homes or businesses have been damaged, will be compensated by their insurers. That cost is already enormous. \u201cExpectations of economic losses stemming from the fires have more than doubled since yesterday to closer to $50 billion, and we estimate that insured losses from the event could exceed $20 billion (and even more if the fires are not controlled),\u201d JPMorgan wrote to clients on Jan. 9, according to the Financial Times.\n\nDecidedly different factors have caused these ballooning costs and losses. \u201cThe area between forests and urban areas in places like Los Angeles is where wildfires spread easily,\u201d said Cameron Rye, the head of modeling research and innovation at the global insurance broker WTW. \u201cAnd the value of such properties in the LA area is growing. Plus we have climate change. January is not the traditional wildfire season in California.\u201d And it\u2019s not just the fact that Angelenos have ever more expensive homes in areas ever more exposed to wildfires; the cost of rebuilding is growing, too\u2014largely due to increased costs for materials.\n\nAlready last year some insurers had concluded that the risk in the Los Angeles area was unsustainable. State Farm, for example, decided not to renew home insurance policies in some of the city\u2019s toniest neighborhoods, and across California the percentage of home insurance policies being dropped has grown for several years, the New York Times reports. \u201cA majority of the insurer\u2019s customers in neighborhoods in West Los Angeles as well as in or near the Santa Monica Mountains including Bel-Air, Pacific Palisades and Woodland Hills are going to lose their coverage,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported last April.\n\nThe Times revealed that 69.4 percent of State Farm\u2019s policyholders in Pacific Palisades stood to lose their home insurance, along with 61.5 percent of policyholders in only slightly less affluent Brentwood\u2014home to LeBron James and other A-list celebrities\u2014and similar percentages in surrounding areas. It\u2019s not clear how many of these homeowners managed to get coverage from other insurers.\n\nOn January, State Farm announced that it would offer existing customers in the fire-stricken areas renewals for another term but said nothing about what would happen after that. (Rather bafflingly, insurance in pricey LA neighborhoods is extremely cheap: In 2023, homeowners in Pacific Palisades paid a median insurance premium of $5,450, the same as homeowners in New Orleans\u2019s low-income Lower Ninth Ward, where the average home is worth less than 5 percent of the typical Pacific Palisades home, Reuters reports.)\n\nBut even if price is no object, Angeleno homeowners will be stranded if insurers keep pulling out. The state-organized California FAIR Plan\u2014a home insurer of last resort\u2014saw its enrollment in Pacific Palisades nearly double between 2023 and 2024, the New York Times reports, but it now risks running out of money.\n\nFlorida is battling the same problem. Over the past five years, the number of homes insured by Florida\u2019s version of California FAIR\u2014Citizens Property Insurance Corp.\u2014has risen threefold, CNN reports. Gov. Ron DeSantis warned last year that Citizens was \u201cnot solvent\u201d and couldn\u2019t function with millions of people enrolled \u201cbecause if a storm hits, it\u2019s going to cause problems for the state.\u201d\n\nBecause backstop programs such as Citizens can\u2019t charge commercial home insurance rates, they face financial collapse when natural disaster strikes. To avert such a situation, Citizens has been trying to shed customers. If financial disaster were to occur, Citizens could levy a so-called hurricane tax on every Florida resident, local TV station WPBF 25 News reports. That would clearly not sit well with most residents.\n\nThe problems afflicting homeowners in charming but climate change-exposed parts of the United States are mirrored by the ones afflicting businesses in increasingly geopolitics-exposed parts of the world. At virtually the same time as climate change-related perils are suddenly making life uncomfortable for people who thought they could live wherever they liked, geopolitically linked perils are making life uncomfortable for companies that thought they could do business wherever they liked.\n\nThe past three-or-so decades of globalization were only possible because political-risk insurers underwrote that risk as Western companies expanded to countries that were not mature liberal democracies. Political-risk insurers (there are around 60, virtually all of which are based in Western countries) provide the specialist policies that cover businesses against virtually every politically motivated risk\u2014from nationalization to war.\n\nBut today\u2019s geopolitical tensions are so intense that underwriters can no longer take on the risk. As I reported in Foreign Policy three years ago, when Russia amassed troops on the Ukrainian border, political-risk underwriters withdrew coverage from Ukraine. When Russia invaded, underwriters stopped insuring political risk in Russia and Belarus, both because the countries were becoming too politically risky (think expropriated aircraft fleets and seized companies) and because insuring in Russia could mean violating sanctions.\n\nEven China has become too risky. Barely any political-risk insurers are willing to underwrite new policies in China anymore. The very few that do impose a long list of criteria\u2014and only insure companies in sectors they consider benign.\n\nThat makes these countries a bit like Pacific Palisades and the Florida coast\u2014still incredibly attractive to many but worryingly risky. In fact, insurers\u2019 realization that political risks are growing so fast that they can\u2019t be insured against is clashing with companies\u2019 realization that they need insurance against these very risks.\n\nWith geopolitical tensions growing fast, other countries could soon join Russia in becoming uninsurable. Belarus is practically already uninsurable; Venezuela, too. \u201cThis widening gulf between the increasing demand and constrained supply has created gaps across specific segments of the political-risk insurance market,\u201d said Kai-Uwe Schanz, until recently deputy managing director of the Geneva Association, a think tank focusing on the insurance sector.\n\n\u201cThe growing difficulty in securing political-risk insurance poses a formidable challenge to Western companies operating in volatile regions. Without adequate coverage, businesses face heightened exposure to threats such as expropriation, sanctions and supply-chain disruptions. These risks could compel companies to curtail operations or exit certain markets altogether.\u201d\n\nIndeed, access to political-risk insurance could one day be limited to countries that are on somewhat friendly terms with the West\u2014not because insurers take ideological positions but because countries aligned with Russia and China pose too severe a risk for underwriters.\n\nWe have just completed a sunny chapter in the history of the Western world: a period in which citizens could live anywhere they wanted because they thought they could ignore climate change and where businesses could operate anywhere they wanted because they thought they could ignore geopolitics.\n\nPerish the thought that Pacific Palisades would in any way resemble Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. But from an insurance perspective, they\u2019re both becoming untouchable.",

                "text": "Though U.S.-India economic ties have grown steadily in the 21st century, this cooperation has underperformed relative to the extraordinary advances in virtually every other aspect of the bilateral relationship. Over the years, the United States has accumulated a growing trade deficit in goods and services with India, reaching more than $45 billion in 2022. India\u2019s high barriers to trade led Trump to label the country the \u201c king \u201d of tariffs.

Over the years, the United States has accumulated a growing trade deficit in goods and services with India, reaching more than $45 billion in 2022. India\u2019s high barriers to trade led Trump to label the country the \u201cking\u201d of tariffs. Indeed, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has used high tariffs to protect domestic industries, attract foreign investment, and promote his \u201cMake in India\u201d policy.\n\nAs Trump proclaims his own fondness for tariffs, skepticism has set in among U.S.-India experts about the prospects for bilateral trade. Trump has promised to impose a 10 to 20 percent tariff on all imports and to hit a select group of countries\u2014including India\u2014with even higher tariffs. If he goes forward with this pledge, some might respond with retaliatory tariffs. These circumstances might make one question whether the United States and India can negotiate a substantial trade agreement\u2014something that they have never done before\u2014in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nYet there are reasons to be optimistic. Trump loves the art of the deal and would like to improve the U.S. economy. His tariffs may well be designed as leverage to open foreign markets for U.S. companies, thereby creating U.S. jobs related to exports and lowering bilateral trade deficits. Modi is a strategic thinker who is focused on growing India\u2019s economy and expanding its role in the world.\n\nThe United States and India both want to enhance their economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region and blunt China\u2019s economic primacy. The time is ripe and the incentives are in place for these two leaders to beat the odds and make a major deal.\n\nEarly in Trump\u2019s first term, when one of us served as the U.S. ambassador to India and the other as assistant U.S. trade representative for South and Central Asia, the United States put on the table its willingness to negotiate a broad trade agreement with India. While U.S. officials thought that the Indian government had signaled general interest in such an agreement, there did not seem to be the concrete follow-through in terms of the mutual concessions required to conclude any such large deal.\n\nOver time, the necessary trade-offs by each side did not materialize, and the two parties were not even able to negotiate a smaller deal that would maintain India\u2019s benefits under the U.S. trade program known as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), created by Congress in 1974 to spur U.S. ties with developing countries. The GSP eliminates tariffs on hundreds of products imported from countries such as India, with the requirement that the beneficiary country provide adequate market access for U.S. products.\n\nThe mechanics of U.S.-India negotiations on the GSP were put into motion in 2017, after the U.S. medical devices and dairy industries filed petitions about India\u2019s restricted market access with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). USTR subsequently undertook a review of these sectors and widened it to goods across other sectors, including IT products. Negotiations on a trade agreement continued into early 2019, but the parties\u2019 efforts were unsuccessful, and USTR had no choice but to end India\u2019s GSP benefits in March 2019.\n\nEven after USTR determined that India no longer qualified for the GSP, the two sides continued to negotiate what was termed a \u201csmall\u201d trade deal to try to restore the program for India. When Trump traveled to the country in February 2020, Indian officials finally signaled that they might be willing to conclude such an agreement. By that time, however, Trump was in the final year of his first term and wanted either a big deal or no deal\u2014which resulted in the latter.\n\nThe two countries have since focused on minor fixes to trade irritants and sidelined ambitions for a groundbreaking agreement, even as the value of bilateral trade grows and the overall bilateral relationship deepens. This should be understood in a broader context: Under former President Joe Biden, the United States was unwilling to offer any country further access to its market and did not enter into any substantial new trade agreements. Instead, the Biden administration sought to develop a different model for trade negotiations that addressed concerns over the impact of market openings on U.S. workers and what it saw as new rules for the 21st-century economy.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the United States rebuffed India\u2019s new interest in exploring a U.S.-India free trade agreement early in Biden\u2019s term. Modi\u2019s government also declined to participate in one of the four pillars of Biden\u2019s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The IPEF focused on nonbinding commitments among 14 countries on supply chain resilience; clean energy, decarbonization, and infrastructure; tax and anti-corruption measures; and selected trade issues, not including market access. India participated in negotiations on the first three pillars, which resulted in agreements on principles and cooperative mechanisms. The trade pillar, which included all countries but India, failed to produce any consensus.\n\nIndia recently signed a flurry of targeted free trade deals with other countries, including Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). But India still has never locked in the benefits of preferential trade in goods and services with its largest and most significant partner, the United States. The Biden administration resolved seven outstanding disputes in the World Trade Organization (WTO) with India, but the idea of a bigger trade deal between the two countries never got off the ground.\n\nTrump and Modi should now be ambitious and seek to negotiate a significant trade and economic arrangement. The new Trump administration will be laser-focused on lowering India\u2019s trade barriers in a variety of sectors, including the ongoing concerns in the medical devices, agriculture, and IT sectors. For its part, India will want to secure continued growth in bilateral trade in goods and services and restore GSP benefits, if Congress reauthorizes the program, which expired at the end of 2020.\n\nOnce the Trump tariffs (and possible Modi retaliatory tariffs) go into effect, the United States and India should view this as only the beginning of the trade and economic dialogue. Both leaders and their advisors should see the logic of aspiring to conclude a broader deal. After all, Trump and Modi are drawn to high-profile initiatives and prefer bilateral deals to multilateral ones.\n\nIn short, neither leader is averse to thinking big. Trump showed during his first term that he is willing to sign trade deals, as he did with Canada, the European Union, Japan, and Mexico\u2014and even in an initial phase with China, though its objectives were not realized. The negotiation of a GSP agreement with India was one of the few trade priorities for which Trump was not able to cross the finish line. Some of Modi\u2019s initiatives have also been bold, such as his overtures to Pakistan early in his first term. Moreover, Modi\u2019s trade negotiating agenda with other countries is unprecedented for India.\n\nThe current political climate in Washington and New Delhi, including a focus on promoting domestic manufacturing, would almost certainly not support negotiating a full-blown free trade agreement. However, the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA) negotiated under the first Trump administration in 2019 could provide a compelling model. The USJTA is not a free trade agreement, but it has some key features of one, particularly involving tariff cuts in several sectors on both sides.\n\nNormally, any preferential tariff arrangements violate the WTO\u2019s requirement that trade between members must be conducted on a nondiscriminatory or \u201cmost favored nation\u201d basis, unless these arrangements are formulated as large-scale free trade agreements. Yet such deals can be cumbersome and difficult to negotiate. First, WTO rules require that free trade agreements cover \u201csubstantially all trade,\u201d which can make it difficult for trading partners to exclude their most sensitive sectors from tariff cuts.\n\nSecond, U.S. negotiators require special trade negotiating authority from Congress before they can submit a free trade agreement for an up-or-down vote by both houses. This means that there cannot be amendments to the terms already negotiated with a trading partner by the executive branch. Congressional votes on free trade agreements are rarely straightforward. Furthermore, utilizing trade negotiating authority from Congress is the only practical way to obtain the legislature\u2019s approval for a comprehensive trade agreement\u2014yet that authority expired in 2020.\n\nWhile the USJTA included tariff concessions on both sides, the first Trump administration chose not to submit the agreement for congressional approval or notify the WTO. At the time, this raised some concerns among lawmakers that it was an end-around of congressional oversight, and there were questions about whether the USJTA violated WTO rules. Nevertheless, the agreement has endured and, in some respects, cemented the economic component of the broader U.S.-Japan strategic partnership. It even includes a groundbreaking side agreement on digital trade, which highlighted that nearly all sectors rely on the digital exchange of information and digital transactions.\n\nA U.S.-India deal could certainly follow the USJTA model. The natural starting point would be to address most of the issues that the parties left on the table during Trump\u2019s first term, when they came close to reaching an agreement. Such a deal now would require substantial tariff reductions by New Delhi because it has much higher tariff rates than Washington; Trump believes in some degree of reciprocity. But this market liberalization would solidify India\u2019s economic relationship with the United States and enhance its prospects for becoming a supply chain hub.\n\nTo make tariff reductions more palatable, Trump and Modi could broaden their horizons to areas that would provide growth potential for both countries. The United States has a long history of negotiating new areas in its trade agreements. These initially included provisions related to labor and the environment, but trade agreements have become increasingly robust\u2014expanding to include trade capacity building, state-owned enterprises, and good regulatory practices, among others.\n\nThere are significant and often complementary elements of the U.S.-India economic relationship that could provide benefits in a major bilateral agreement. For example, the United States is India\u2019s largest trading partner, in part because of the substantial Indian services provided to U.S. companies that outsource their IT development and data processing needs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian companies were critical in maintaining the back-office operations of many aspects of the U.S. financial and medical sectors.\n\nIndian services companies (as well as U.S. technology companies) also seek H-1B visas for highly skilled Indian engineers to work in the IT sector in the United States\u2014though this need has lessened a bit with more than 1,000 U.S. companies now having Global Capability Centers in India. Nevertheless, there would be mutual benefits to an arrangement that addresses concerns regarding the flow of data and labor mobility in the services sector and ensures the continued success of this business model.\n\nThe technology ties between the United States and India have grown by leaps and bounds in the last 20 years. The recent Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), led by both countries\u2019 national security advisors, is designed to advance the technology relationship and defense industrial cooperation. The iCET (or a rebranded version of it) should further the U.S.-India strategic partnership by fostering an ecosystem among governments, businesses, and academic institutions to advance joint development of cutting-edge technologies.\n\nUnder this technology initiative, India requires increased access to sensitive and regulated U.S. dual-use technologies for cooperative work with the United States in semiconductors, space-related technology, clean energy products, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology, among other areas. The U.S. government sees India\u2019s development in these sectors as beneficial to U.S. economic needs and interests and to strengthening India\u2019s capabilities and economy.\n\nThough there has been enormous progress over the years in streamlining the U.S. licensing process for dual-use technologies, it still has burdensome aspects. A U.S.-India trade arrangement could seek to reduce this export-control red tape while addressing related security concerns and establishing standard-setting mechanisms for the design and development of critical technologies. As two of the leading countries in the IT sector, the United States and India should also have a mutual interest in developing common standards for the digital economy rather than letting other major players, such as China, set those standards.\n\nEnergy supply and security is another critical need for India and a market opportunity for the United States. India is one of the world\u2019s largest energy importers, and the new Trump administration will almost certainly support all forms of India\u2019s energy needs, including oil, liquefied natural gas, clean coal, and advancements in renewables and nuclear power. A potential agreement should seek to support key elements of these interactions\u2014regarding U.S. exports and India\u2019s security of supply\u2014while possibly addressing U.S. concerns about the high volume of Indian oil imports from Russia.\n\nSimilarly, in health care, India and the United States have complementary capabilities and needs. The United States is a leader in developing vaccines and pharmaceutical products, while India is a leader in manufacturing them. Trump and Modi share an interest in keeping drugs accessible and affordable. Moreover, India seeks to become a critical supply chain alternative to China in the pharmaceutical sector and reduce its own dependency on China, which the United States supports.\n\nRelated to each of these areas is the interest in facilitating further bilateral investments. There is already a substantial amount of U.S. investment in India and now a developing flow of Indian acquisitions and greenfield investments in the United States. Any economic agreement should lower barriers not only to trade but also to investments, especially encouraging increased levels of Indian investment in the United States, thereby creating more jobs for Americans.\n\nThe elements now exist for a significant deal between the United States and India. Such a deal can lock in the mutual benefits of the economic relationship, provide greater assurance and predictability to parties in both countries, and enable India to fill some of the void created by higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nBut the deal cannot be left solely to the bureaucracies in each country, which have a long history of meaningful engagement but unsuccessful efforts to resolve the most challenging bilateral trade policy disagreements. The bureaucracies lack the political clout to overcome the inevitable domestic resistance to market-opening measures and the need to make difficult political trade-offs. Any deal will require each side to make concessions with the type of give and take that only Trump and Modi can provide\u2014if they have the ambition to make the deal.\n\nThere is another important imperative that should push Trump and Modi to strike a deal this time. Any agreement would provide not only economic growth opportunities but also a strategic benefit. Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s major source of influence in the Indo-Pacific is Beijing\u2019s economic clout. The United States and India need to work together to counterbalance China\u2019s dominant economic presence in the region.\n\nChina is the major trading partner of nearly every country in the region and an integral part of the Indo-Pacific trade architecture through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), an agreement among 15 countries representing approximately 30 percent of global GDP. China has also applied for membership in the high-standards, 12-nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\n\nNeither India nor the United States is a party to these two regional agreements. India withdrew from RCEP negotiations during its final stages in 2019, concerned that the agreement would lead to a flood of imports from China. The United States withdrew from the CPTPP\u2019s predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, at the outset of Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nAn initial step for the United States and India in challenging China\u2019s dominant trade influence in the region is for the two countries to strike their own economic arrangement by resolving long-standing trade and investment issues and locking in cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, energy, and health care. The United States would benefit from increased market access in India; New Delhi would benefit by strengthening its economic ties with Washington, its leading trade partner, and boosting its appeal as an alternative supply chain hub for those looking to diversify away from Beijing.\n\nThe United States and India would still need to increase their levels of trade, investment, and assistance with other countries in the Indo-Pacific to compete more effectively with China. But now is the time for Trump, Modi, and their respective teams to raise their ambitions, sit down at the negotiating table, and seize the opportunity to reinforce their strategic partnership by elevating the economic relationship to a new level.",

His goal was to help restore self-belief and resource to the State Department, which had endured a torrid four years under then former President Donald Trump:\n\nInvesting in our diplomacy isn\u2019t something we do just because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the world. We do it in order to live in peace, security, and prosperity. We do it because it\u2019s in our own naked self-interest.\n\nBiden\u2019s speechwriters were smart in characterizing diplomacy as a means to advance \u201cnaked self-interest.\u201d In terms of public messaging, stripping altruism from U.S. diplomacy made the State Department appear vital and ruthless, the nation\u2019s first line of defense. But the president\u2019s primary purpose was therapeutic: to reassure that State would be accorded respect and reenergized under his watch.\n\nTrump\u2019s first term was brutal for the State Department. Because of sharp proposed budget cuts\u2014mitigated to some extent by Congress but injurious to morale\u2014a hiring freeze, and career professionals bolting for the exits, the department experienced a 10 percent staff reduction during Trump\u2019s presidency. Indignity was piled on indignity, with little respite across the four years. Before he was even inaugurated, Trump\u2019s transition team communicated that all of President Barack Obama\u2019s noncareer ambassadors (mainly Democratic fundraisers) had to vacate their embassies by Inauguration Day, breaking with the tradition of affording ambassadors a grace period.\n\nTrump\u2019s first secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, introduced a hiring freeze and commissioned a management consultancy, Insigniam, to help realize efficiencies. The private firm distributed a questionnaire that invited State Department employees to assist in their own defenestration: \u201cTo optimally support the future mission of the Department, what one or two things should your work unit totally stop doing or providing?\u201d Unsurprisingly, Tillerson and Insigniam did not receive the response rate they were hoping for.\n\nThat many conservatives viewed State principally as an antagonist to Trump\u2019s agenda, rather than an instrument to advance U.S. interests, was illustrated in an interview that Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham conducted with the president in November 2017. Ingraham asked, \u201cAre you worried that the State Department doesn\u2019t have enough Donald Trump nominees in there to push your vision through?\u201d before adding that \u201cother State Departments, including [President Ronald] Reagan\u2019s, at times, undermined his agenda. \u2026 And there is a concern that the State Department currently is undermining your agenda.\u201d\n\nTrump replied, accurately, that \u201cI\u2019m the only one that matters. Because when it comes to it, that\u2019s what the policy is going to be. You\u2019ve seen that. You\u2019ve seen it strongly.\u201d He also highlighted the merits of simply leaving posts vacant, for it was better to have no one in roles than the wrong ones: \u201cSo, we don\u2019t need all the people that they [State] want. You know, don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m a businessperson. I tell my people, \u2018When you don\u2019t need to fill slots, don\u2019t fill them.\u2019 But we have some people that I\u2019m not happy with there.\u201d\n\nThough Mike Pompeo, who succeeded a humiliated Tillerson in April 2018, lifted the hiring freeze, significant problems persisted. Key ambassadorships and assistant secretary of state roles\u2014described by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a retired four-star general, as tantamount to \u201cbattalion commanders\u201d\u2014went unfilled. Across Tillerson\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s tenures, diplomats were targeted for \u201cwrongthink\u201d under previous administrations.\n\nAs seasoned diplomat and outgoing CIA Director William Burns wrote in 2019, \u201cMost pernicious of all was the practice of blacklisting individual officers simply because they worked on controversial issues during the Obama administration, such as the Iran nuclear deal, plunging morale to its lowest level in decades.\u201d Assessing the damage that the Trump administration\u2019s staffing cuts and hiring freezes had wreaked on the State Department, Antony Blinken, who succeeded Pompeo as secretary of state following Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory, said in an interview before taking office that that \u201cpenalizes you in all sorts of ways that will go on for generations, not just for a bunch of years.\u201d\n\nSo, what does Trump\u2019s second term mean for the State Department? The obvious answer is more misery. But let\u2019s begin with a potential positive so far as departmental leadership is concerned. Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, will fly through the Senate confirmation process, and he does not appear to regard the department he will soon lead as part of the so-called deep state. Rubio was a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been consistently interventionist, subscribes to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\u2019s notion that the United States is the one \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d and has a track record of flagging human rights causes. Rubio is about as establishment-friendly a Republican as currently exists.\n\nBut this almost guarantees that Rubio will experience significant frustrations, as his internationalist worldview and Trump\u2019s America First is split by a chasm. If Trump\u2019s first term is any guide, Rubio will have to bow as low as Pompeo if his tenure stands any chance of going the distance. In being nominated as secretary of state, Rubio has demonstrated that he possesses some of those self-abnegating traits. But it will be much more challenging to sustain the necessary pliability and loyalty while in office, as Rubio\u2019s counsel trails off into the void and Trump starts unloading on social media. It does not augur well that Tammy Bruce, Trump\u2019s pick to become State Department spokesperson, once described Rubio as \u201cthe kid waving frantically in the back of [the] room trying to prove relevance.\u201d\n\nIt is, of course, also possible that Trump placed Rubio at State as he has no intention of meaningfully using the man, and the department he leads, as a shaper of foreign policy. But there are precedents for ignoring State and running foreign policy from the White House. Does the name William P. Rogers ring a bell? The likelihood it doesn\u2019t reveals something about how President Richard Nixon viewed the State Department: as an unwieldy, leak-prone obstacle to bold policy initiatives. Secretary of State Rogers was shut out almost entirely from the Nixon administration\u2019s most significant foreign-policy achievement: the opening to China. (Rogers\u2019s humiliation was a foretaste of the marginalization of the State Department to come.) The difference between Nixon and Trump is that the former drew upon Henry Kissinger, of course, and the latter will likely draw upon his instincts\u2014which his closest advisors will cheer on regardless of their quality and utility.\n\nBeyond the individual who leads the State Department, there might also be a seismic change in the way diplomats are hired and fired. Three months before the end of his first term, Trump issued Executive Order 13957, which allowed him to convert certain federal civil service jobs\u2014namely, all \u201ccareer positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d\u2014to \u201cexcepted service\u201d under the classification Schedule F. This would have effectively allowed the president to fire civil service employees and hire replacements without following the usual civil service hiring and placement procedure; they would effectively be political appointees. Trump bluntly expressed his broader purpose in his very first 2024 campaign event: \u201cEither the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.\u201d Schedule F did not go into effect because Biden rescinded it as soon as he assumed the presidency. But in an executive order signed late on Inauguration Day, titled \u201cInitial rescissions of harmful executive orders and actions,\u201d Trump revoked Biden\u2019s order as the first step to reinstating Schedule F and defeating what he regards as an implacably hostile federal bureaucracy. Trump has ominously referred to the \u201cDeep State Department,\u201d and it is firmly in his crosshairs.\n\nIf Trump succeeds, the implications for State are dire. Meritocratic principles will be ditched in favor of loyalty to the president\u2019s agenda. The threat of losing one\u2019s job for perceived disloyalty might also have a stultifying effect on the quality of advice dispensed by State employees. Why risk flagging human rights abuses in a nation that happens to be in the president\u2019s good books at any given moment?\n\nBut Trump\u2019s reforms will not be easy to achieve. In April 2024, Biden introduced a regulation\u2014\u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles\u201d\u2014that served to \u201creinforce and clarify longstanding civil service protections and merit system principles.\u201d Trump would have to issue and finalize a new regulation, which would take time. Congress would almost certainly perform a role as a brake to presidential action. There is at least some bipartisan consensus that competence is a trait worth having in a diplomat. Given the profound nature of the potential change, contrary to the meritocratic purpose of the 1883 Pendleton Act that created the modern U.S. civil service, Schedule F would likely end up in the Supreme Court. And then Trump will discover whether his appointments to the bench are truly as loyal as he expects them to be. Guardrails will be severely tested, and it is impossible to say whether they will hold.\n\nWhatever happens next, Foggy Bottom is in for a rough ride. The State Department is a perfect representation of the Professional-Managerial Class, a category term coined by Barbara and John Ehrenreich, so reviled by the Trump movement. State is populated by staff educated at elite universities and military academies, professes to hold true to a bipartisan objectivity in a manner that triggers the partisan, and has crafted foreign-policy initiatives pertaining to alliance building and free trade agreements that jar with Trump\u2019s America First beliefs. If you were to overleave a political map of the United States with the states from which the foreign service principally recruits, there would be scant overlap between red and blue. Why should Trump voters care about an institution culturally alien to them and that appears to have been complicit in expending vast resource on unnecessary wars and foreign assistance?\n\nThe longer history of the State Department\u2019s decline is of course vitally important, too. Over the past 40 years, State has been fighting a losing battle for influence in the executive branch, as the Pentagon and a beefed-up National Security Council pushed this faded heavyweight around. And it is worth remembering that the department has suffered austerity at the hands of Republican and Democratic presidents alike: Bill Clinton-era budget and personnel cuts, stemming from a misguided desire to realize a post-Cold War peace dividend with a sharp contraction in diplomatic resources, were devastating.\n\nBut the threat posed by Trump is ideological, premeditated, and of a different order of magnitude. This vast repository of expertise will find Trump\u2019s second term even harder to bear than the first, and this is dismal news for the United States and the world. As Gen. James Mattis, before his stint as Trump\u2019s defense secretary, warned in 2013, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.\u201d",

Once, he recalled, a soldier quartering in a civilian home killed his host, who forgot to bring him food. Another time, soldiers arbitrarily executed a farmer after a fierce battle near his field.\n\nArmed with these memories, Htoo Naw was among the first troops to charge the base near Kyaikdon town during the assault last March; eventually, he apprehended the commander.\n\n\u201cMy only thought was to capture the base so the people in this area can live freely. I wouldn\u2019t even mind if I died,\u201d he said.\n\nBy last November, the thick jungle undergrowth was already reclaiming the concrete and twisted metal that remained of the military base after the KNLA torched it. There were two bomb craters in front of a flagpole, which were from air strikes launched during the battle and that killed one KNLA soldier but failed to stop the Karen national flag from being hoisted overhead.\n\nA commando wearing a T-shirt and camo pants stands atop a bit of rubble in a dirt-covered opening in the brush. Two soldiers are seen walking into the brush at left.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s simmering ethnic conflict intensified dramatically when the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government in 2021, pitting the junta against a coalition of ethnic armed organizations like the KNLA, as well as newer pro-democracy forces. The military has lost unprecedented swaths of territory in the borderlands, particularly since October 2023.\n\nKyaikdon\u2019s capture was part of a broader offensive last spring that saw Myanmar\u2019s military expelled from key areas along the country\u2019s border with Thailand. Fighting in the area has since lulled, with the military managing to cling to some strongholds without reclaiming lost territory. Though momentum is against it, the regime has so far proved resilient, maintaining control over the country\u2019s heartland and major population centers.\n\nThe Myanmar military has long contained ethnic insurgencies in the borderlands by using divide and conquer techniques and compartmentalizing the civil conflict. But now it faces opposition from all sides at once and remains unable to project strength into the periphery.\n\nArmed groups in Myanmar\u2019s north have seized all but one official border crossing with China. Last April, the KNLA came close to capturing Myawaddy, the largest border crossing with Thailand, which saw roughly $10 million in trade per day before the COVID-19 pandemic. Control over these border areas is crucial to establishing autonomous enclaves, because it gives armed groups access to international trade and weapons markets and creates a secure back line.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s civil war has continued to decimate overland trade, upsetting the military and the country\u2019s neighbors. Regime figures show that when comparing trade through Myawaddy between April and July 2024 to the same period in 2023, it dropped by 87 percent.\n\nIn addition to losing key sources of revenue, the military\u2019s battlefield setbacks have left armed groups within striking distance of Naypyitaw, Myanmar\u2019s heavily fortified capital, and Mandalay, its second-biggest city.\n\nIn response, China and Thailand have heaped pressure on the armed groups in the hopes of forcing a cease-fire to secure their borders and resume trade. China has closed border crossings that the northern armed groups, such as the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, rely on to run their statelets. Meanwhile, Bangkok has seemingly squeezed the KNLA\u2019s access to ammunition, some of which is sourced from Thailand.\n\nThailand is pushing for talks between the KNLA and Myanmar\u2019s military to reopen the Asian Highway, a major trade artery that runs from Bangkok through Myawaddy to Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, and on to India. The road became a war zone last April, as the military tried to use it to relieve beleaguered forces in Myawaddy by sending a massive column of around 1,500 troops, along with armored vehicles.\n\nA bearded man in a T-shirt has his arm around a man in a dark hoodie. A ramshackle shelter is seen behind them amid a jungly growth.\n\nCalled the Aung Zeya (\u201cSuccessful Victory\u201d) column, the operation has been anything but. In a camp set in a grove of bamboo and banana trees, Saw Kaw, a KNLA lieutenant, recalled initial engagement with the Aung Zeya column. \u201cThey were marching in two rows on either side of the highway,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the second day, we shot their commander with a sniper, they all scattered, and we seized an armored vehicle.\u201d\n\nSaw Kaw said that the military soldiers tried to progress through the jungle instead, slowing them down considerably and leaving them open to guerrilla ambushes. \u201cStarting [last] April, they tried to send this column to Myawaddy within four days, but they still haven\u2019t got there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning, they used a lot of force, but now the column is on the defensive and we\u2019re attacking them.\u201d\n\nMorgan Michaels, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the Aung Zeya operation wasn\u2019t a complete failure. \u201cIt succeeded in expelling the Karen coalition from the key town of Kawkareik,\u201d he said, which made it \u201csignificantly more difficult for Karen fighters to project force into regime-held areas in Mon state and Bago region.\u201d The Bago region extends to the outskirts of Naypyitaw and Yangon.\n\nMichaels said that the KNLA had also expended a lot of soldiers and ammunition in the fighting, resulting in a \u201cseven-month lull\u201d that allowed the military to turn its attention to areas on the Chinese border instead. \u201cA sort of stalemate has persisted along the highway since,\u201d he said.\n\nThree men in camo look at the twisted metal remnants of a downed helicopter. A dirt path stretches through the brush into the distance.\n\nOn the highway between Kawkareik and Myawaddy lies Thin Gan Nyi Naung, a town that fell to the KNLA last spring after a nine-month siege. A KNLA officer, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press, said that he was given one hour\u2019s notice that he would need to send 150 soldiers to the battlefield in Thin Gan Nyi Naung last March. \u201cMy forces are always prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them where and when we would meet, and they all just responded, \u2018Okay, we are ready.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe sprawling military installation in Thin Gan Nyi Naung was really four bases put together. The officer said that soldiers\u2019 families lived with them in the cantonment, which he considered a form of human shield. The KNLA steadily pushed the regime troops and their families into one base against the side of a mountain, where they were surrounded, according to the officer.\n\nAt the beginning of April, the military soldiers said that they were ready to surrender\u2014but before they could, the regime launched a massive barrage of airstrikes. \u201cI think it was intentional to undermine the efforts to surrender,\u201d the officer said, adding that it was likely also to force its own troops to fight to the death. Ultimately, that didn\u2019t happen: The 600 surrendering regime soldiers and their family members were evacuated.\n\nA sign with lettering in Burmese stands damaged among weeds and brush. Palm trees and a cloud-filled blue sky in the distance.\n\nNonetheless, the KNLA has been unable to replicate the total victory of the armed groups in the north. With an ammunition shortage, clearing the regime forces from Kawkareik and Myawaddy may prove challenging. Michaels suspects that the shortage is due to stricter Thai border controls. China has also reportedly pressured the UWSA, the most powerful armed group in the north, to stop selling arms and ammunition to other groups in an effort to stabilize the border and prevent the military regime\u2019s collapse.\n\nDespite these obstacles, a sense of optimism still pervades the Karen armed movement, while morale within the Myanmar military plummets. At a KNLA riverside camp in November, Way Pweh Ah, 41, pounded chilis with a mortar and pestle as he recalled a game of cat and mouse with the military during the battle for Thin Gan Nyi Naung. A chef before the coup, he now serves in an artillery unit and happily doubles as the camp cook.\n\nWay Pweh Ah is ethnically Karen but was living in Yangon when the military seized power in 2021; he joined the tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in mass peaceful protests. During a crackdown that February, security forces beat Way Pweh Ah within an inch of his life, he said, fracturing his skull, neck, and back.\n\nThe chef left the city for the jungle, following a family legacy: Both his grandfather and uncle were killed while fighting against the military with the KNLA. Way Pweh Ah believes that his fate will be different. \u201cMy grandfather couldn\u2019t defeat them, my uncle couldn\u2019t defeat them, but now it\u2019s our turn,\u201d he said.",

The arrest brought an end to a dramatic weekslong standoff between the investigators and Yoon\u2019s presidential security guards, which gripped the nation with fears that a violent clash might occur on the hilltop presidential compound in Yongsan, Seoul. But the country still remains stranded in largely uncharted territory\u2014and with many possible constitutional clashes ahead.\n\nOn Jan. 3, investigators and police officers were forced to abandon their first attempt to arrest Yoon when they were blocked by a \u201chuman wall\u201d of 200 presidential security guards and soldiers standing arm in arm to guard the compound. After a tense six-hour standoff and a series of scuffles, the helplessly outnumbered investigators retreated. Yoon remained barricaded in his fortress, shielded by barbed wire, buses, and bodyguards, and a brigade of hard-line loyalists planted across his cabinet.\n\nAs dawn broke on Wednesday, investigators returned with 3,200 police officers carrying ladders and wire cutters, backed by warnings from prosecutors that Yoon\u2019s security guards would be arrested if they blocked the officials a second time. Officers scaled bus barricades blocking the entrance, while others hiked up a mountain trail at the back of the residence. This time, Yoon\u2019s security guards put up no visible resistance. Following hours of negotiations, Yoon struck a deal with massed law enforcement officials to accept arrest.\n\nIn a video message released shortly afterward, Yoon said he had decided to submit to questioning to prevent \u201cunsavory bloodshed.\u201d But he insisted that the investigation was still illegal and that the \u201crule of law had completely collapsed.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea has been stranded in the uncharted territory of detaining a sitting, if suspended, president, wrestling with an unprecedented power vacuum. Although Yoon was impeached by the National Assembly last month, he has not yet been removed from office, as his impeachment is still under review by the Constitutional Court. This meant that Yoon remains entitled to his security detail, which, paradoxically, is also answerable to the acting president, Choi Sang-mok.\n\nWhen investigators called on Choi to rein in Yoon\u2019s security team, Choi, Finance Minister and veteran economic technocrat who ascended the ranks of Yoon\u2019s cabinet as an avowed conservative loyalist, turned a blind eye. Choi\u2019s chief of staff argued, in a letter to the investigators, that the acting president lacked the authority to command the Presidential Security Service (PSS). Even as the second arrest attempt drew close, and opposition lawmakers cried out to stand down the PSS, Choi remained unwilling to wade into the standoff.\n\nAs the arrest unfolded on Wednesday, Choi took an ostensibly neutralist stance by warning both the sides against violence. \u201cThis is a very important moment for maintaining order and the rule of law in South Korea,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot tolerate any violence between government agencies for any purposes because it will irreparably damage the trust of our people and our international reputation.\u201d\n\nChoi\u2019s parochial vision for his provisional leadership is seeded in politics, not law. While the South Korean Constitution empowers the acting president to exercise the authority of the president, it does not delineate the contours of his powers and duties. This constitutional silence, paired with the makeshift nature of the office and its fragile democratic credentials, is conventionally interpreted to entrust the acting president with all the powers of the presidency, with a caveat\u2014\u201cas appropriate, to maintain the status quo,\u201d guided by a keen attunement to the political crisis born of the presidential vacancy. At the same time, the acting president bears an affirmative duty to uphold the rule of law, which may require exercising powers that challenge the existing state of affairs, creating something of a constitutional limbo.\n\nEven so, the authority to command the executive\u2019s security service to comply with a lawful arrest warrant falls squarely within the acting president\u2019s jurisdiction, if not at the forefront of his duty. \u201cEntrusted with all the powers of the presidency, the acting president inarguably has the authority to command the Presidential Security Service,\u201d Kim Seon-taek, a constitutional scholar at Korea University School of Law, told South Korean daily Hankyoreh. \u201cChoi\u2019s refusal to command the Presidential Security Service is driven by political considerations, not by the law.\u201d\n\nAs an unelected interim commander without a clear constitutional playbook to follow, Choi is in limbo. His powers are governed not by the constitution but by an embattled standoff between his domestic political agenda, partisan politics, and his lack of a popular mandate. \u201cThe inability or refusal of acting President Choi to call on the PSS to stand down is overdetermined [by] his own political inclinations, pressure from his party, pressure on the street, and a sense that the acting president\u2019s mandate is limited by a reduced legitimacy to make grand decisions and gestures,\u201d said Mason Richey, a political scientist at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\n\nChoi\u2019s democratic legitimacy is further weakened by the fact that he is the second acting president to take the helm after Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was impeached by opposition lawmakers after he refused to make the judicial appointments required for the Constitutional Court to review Yoon\u2019s impeachment case.\n\nBut even if Choi had assumed the mantle of commander in chief, Yoon\u2019s impromptu militia might not have heeded his command. \u201cAlthough Yoon has been impeached by the National Assembly, he is undeniably the sitting president elected by the people and is receiving the corresponding security measures prescribed by law,\u201d Park Jong-jun, the chief of the PSS and a longtime conservative stalwart who also served as deputy chief of conservative President Park Geun-hye\u2019s security service, said in a televised address following the first arrest attempt. He defended his decision to fight against Yoon\u2019s arrest warrant\u2014which he called \u201cmired in controversies over its legality\u201d\u2014as an allegiance to his duty to protect the president. \u201cIf my judgment on the matter is wrong, I am willing to bear any legal consequences,\u201d he added. Park, charged with obstruction of justice, has since resigned from his post.\n\nThis marked the first time that a security chief had addressed the nation since South Korea\u2019s dark age of military dictatorship. Park faces accusations of conspiring in Yoon\u2019s failed self-coup, along with former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, a longtime confidant of Yoon who led Yoon\u2019s security services before being promoted to spearhead his martial law decree.\n\nAs security chief, Kim turned the agency into an army of acolytes poised to stand in Yoon\u2019s last line of defense by hiring hard-line conservative loyalists with close personal connections to Yoon and his wife. In 2022, Kim controversially sought to militarize the agency with an amendment to the Presidential Security Service Act, which would grant the security chief the authority to command the military and police. After drawing fierce criticisms that the move was reminiscent of President Park Chung-hee\u2019s authoritarian regime, the amendment was eventually repealed to authorize the security chief to \u201ccooperate with the heads of relevant agencies.\u201d\n\nThe PSS prides itself in \u201csecuring the president\u2019s absolute safety as the reason for its existence and sacred duty.\u201d Created in 1963 under Park Chung-hee, who rose to power by staging a coup against a democratically elected government, the agency is a relic of authoritarian rule. Park\u2019s security chief, Park Jong-kyu, was nicknamed \u201cPistol Park\u201d for brandishing his gun at anyone who got in President Park\u2019s way. Park\u2019s next security chief, Cha Ji-cheol, emerged as a powerful \u201csecond-in-command\u201d wielding unchecked\u2014and unconstitutional\u2014authority over state affairs. During the Busan-Masan democratic uprisings, Cha infamously urged Park to crush the protestors with tanks and deployed air forces.\n\nThe security agency swelled into a militia that continued its legacy of violence under Park\u2019s autocratic successor, President Chun Doo-hwan, who seized power after Park\u2019s assassination in 1979. Chun\u2019s security chief, Jang Se-dong, was a chief architect of Chun\u2019s coup and co-conspirator of the massacre of thousands of protesters during the Gwangju uprising.\n\nSince South Korea\u2019s democratization in 1987, the PSS has waned in power, earning the nickname \u201cshadow security\u201d under a string of democratic presidents attuned to the echoes of its troubled history. When President Park Geun-hye, daughter of Park Chung-hee, took office, the agency\u2019s power was revived, harking back to its authoritarian legacy.\n\nBut after revelations arose that the agency aided and abetted Park\u2019s collusions with a shaman-like advisor\u2014a sprawling corruption saga that ended in Park\u2019s impeachment\u2014her liberal successor, President Moon Jae-in, pledged to dismantle the agency and create an independent presidential security bureau under the police department. Lawmakers introduced bills to disband the agency, distraught by the remnants of political collusion between the agency and the president.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his predecessors, Yoon\u2019s security chief thrust himself into the president\u2019s last line of defense. Shadows of the bizarre, twisted camaraderie between presidents and security chiefs\u2014and their schemes of autocracy\u2014still loom over the young democracy.\n\nTo end the legacy of militarized security forces, opposition lawmakers are pushing bills to disband the PSS and instead establish an independent presidential security bureau under the National Police Agency, which operates within the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. \u201cAs Yoon\u2019s Presidential Security Service is dismantling the constitution and the laws and positioning itself as a private militia for insurrection, it no longer has a reason to exist,\u201d said Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn most of South Korea\u2019s democratic allies, security organizations for heads of state operate as autonomous agencies under the police department, shielded from unchecked executive command. \u201cSuch structures allow the agency to be checked by the law and by other governmental powers. They prevent abuses of power,\u201d said Han Seung-whoon, a professor of police administration at Dongshin University. \u201cA security organization structured as an agency directly under the president takes on the characteristics of a private militia, which is seen only in underdeveloped or authoritarian regimes.\u201d\n\nWith an impeached president clinging to power, security guards pledging allegiance, and an acting president sitting on the sidelines, the process of Yoon\u2019s arrest only narrowly escaped descending into bloodshed on the hills of Yongsan. South Korea is going to emerge from this even more politically polarized and fractured than it was before, which is going to have some continuing long-term consequences on the stability of governance,\u201d Richey said. Once again, South Korea faces a timeless challenge: to build a constitutional system resilient to autocracy, shielded from any collusions between presidents and security chiefs, or the complacency of an acting president.\n\nIn the book People Who Go to Work at the Blue House, published by the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History, Lee Seong-woo, a presidential security officer who guarded six South Korean presidents from 1987 to 2012, writes, \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that a presidential security officer guards the president as a public figure, not the president as a person. Never forget that.\u201d It\u2019s time for South Korea to build a new line of defense against autocracy.",

China\u2019s increasingly closed information environment has also exacerbated doubts around whether the results and benefits of collaboration will be properly shared.\n\nIn this environment, the renewal on Dec. 13 of the two countries\u2019 long-standing science and technology agreement (STA) was an important step toward stabilizing the bilateral scientific relationship. While a lapse of the STA might have had modest immediate impact, prominent scientists noted that canceling the agreement would have sent a damaging signal. The recently amended STA, with added guardrails in place to address national security and reciprocity concerns, provides space for continued beneficial scientific cooperation with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) while also resisting pressure for decoupling.\n\nThe U.S.-PRC Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology, signed in 1979, was the first major agreement between the two countries after the normalization of diplomatic relations. Since that STA\u2019s signing more than four decades ago, the two governments have renewed it roughly every five years, most recently during the first Trump administration, which added a new section to the agreement in an effort to strengthen intellectual property rights protections.\n\nThe 2024 changes to the STA strengthen researcher protections, reciprocity on data-sharing, and accountability for continued government-to-government scientific cooperation. The amended agreement embodies the outgoing Biden administration\u2019s \u201cde-risking\u201d of relations with China. The goal was to set clear guardrails around science and technology cooperation, especially in areas that could aid China\u2019s military, while not seeking to decouple scientific progress that could damage not only the United States\u2019 research and innovation, but also the lives of its citizens. The revised STA is a good reminder that, with the right controls in place, scientific cooperation with China can still provide important benefits.\n\nThe STA does not mandate any cooperation. Instead, it is an umbrella agreement that sets consistent terms and protections for U.S. science agencies that pursue cooperative arrangements with their Chinese counterparts, such as joint projects or memorandums of understanding.\n\nCooperation under the STA has benefited the U.S. in a number of areas, including advances in maternal nutrition, earthquake prediction, the collection of influenza data for vaccine development, more timely and accurate air quality data, and agricultural pest management practices that helped avert significant crop losses.\n\nJust as importantly, continued scientific engagement provides visibility on scientific research in China\u2014visibility that the United States might lose if research collaboration were to be cut off. China now conducts world-leading research in a range of scientific areas, which are important for the United States to stay up to date on for its own scientific advances.\n\nThe STA has also benefited China through specific projects in HIV/AIDS prevention, child health, flood control, and climate change monitoring, among other areas, and more broadly in establishing collaboration with leading U.S. institutions. China\u2019s leadership, concerned about losing such linkages, made extending the agreement a priority. Speaking a few days after the renewal in December, a spokesperson from China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited the STA renewal as \u201can important step in implementing the consensus reached during the China-U.S. presidential meeting\u201d while Chinese state media touted benefits \u201cfor both nations and the world\u201d in continued bilateral scientific research collaboration.\n\nThis is the first major rewrite since the STA was originally signed. The agreement has been updated to be more consistent with current issues as well as to account for the state of U.S.-China relations. Changes include provisions emphasizing the importance of researcher safety and well-being; a practical dispute resolution mechanism to address implementation concerns, which replaces an outdated high-level Joint Commission on Science and Technology; and multiple sections on transparency and data-sharing.\n\nBefore the negotiations started, the biggest concerns for U.S. and global researchers were data-sharing, transparency, and integrity. China has what is arguably the world\u2019s strictest set of overlapping laws and regulations limiting cross-border data flows, which makes international collaboration increasingly fraught. For example, foreign researchers collaborating with Chinese counterparts can face difficulty exporting or accessing data from joint projects to anywhere outside of China.\n\nIf they do export data out of China, foreign and Chinese researchers alike could face challenges\u2014including the risk of arrest\u2014or other unpredictable enforcement of relevant data laws and regulations, which focus on controlling \u201cimportant data,\u201d a term that is used in China\u2019s data laws but insufficiently defined. China\u2019s move in April 2023 to limit international access to its primary academic database (known as CNKI), particularly for scientific conference proceedings and dissertations, raised broader concerns on China\u2019s commitment to open science.\n\nA new section in the STA seeks to address these concerns with commitments around data management, access, and transparency. Skeptics may question whether strengthened provisions will truly address the long-standing data issues with China that have built up over several years. But Beijing, acting largely out of concerns that its data regime was damaging its business environment, took steps in the right direction at the same time as the agreement was being renegotiated; in March 2024, Chinese authorities announced important\u2014if incomplete\u2014progress on relaxing some of their onerous and self-damaging restrictions on sharing data.\n\nThe STA negotiation provided an opportunity for the United States to push on these adjustments to China\u2019s data regime, including clarification around implementation and how these changes will be applied to scientific collaboration. The new dispute resolution mechanism can be used to provide more accountability, with provisions for U.S. researchers to cease cooperation if their Chinese counterparts do not reciprocate. Data-sharing issues are common in joint research with China, and this mechanism will not solve all these problems\u2014but it\u2019s welcome progress that should also benefit nongovernmental researchers.\n\nThe STA has been a source of controversy, particularly with some members of the U.S. Congress, including within the House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, who argue that research shared under the agreement could support China\u2019s military modernization.\n\nThese criticisms are misplaced. Officials across the U.S. executive branch and Congress\u2014and from both parties\u2014are clear-eyed about China\u2019s broad-ranging efforts to leverage civilian, commercial, and academic research for military and defense purposes, and the threat that this poses to U.S. national security. This naturally circumscribes the scope for cooperation, and Washington has been clear that the STA does not support any cooperation on critical and emerging technologies.\n\nBefore any proposed cooperation under the STA is allowed to proceed, it is subject to an internal risk-benefit review, including on national security risks. The Biden administration strengthened this process to ensure any national security risks are sufficiently considered and addressed.\n\nMembers of Congress and national security experts have expressed additional concerns\u2014unrelated to the STA, though sometimes conflated with it\u2014around broader Chinese access to U.S. labs and universities. These are being addressed through separate research security efforts. In July, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published new \u201cGuidelines for Research Security Programs\u201d at U.S. institutes and universities that receive significant federal funding\u2014highlighting national security risks from China and its exploitation of international scientific collaboration while preserving the United States\u2019 openness.\n\nBut there is clearly more work to do in protecting U.S. labs. Universities have made progress in their own research security efforts, however, and the National Science Foundation announced new funding in July to establish a national center and five regional centers to share risks, training, and best practices across higher education.\n\nThe amended U.S.-PRC STA can serve as a useful reference and model for other countries in their efforts to \u201cde-risk\u201d science and technology cooperation with China. China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology reports that China has 115 intergovernmental science and technology agreements, some of which are being updated or renegotiated. Other countries would likely maintain science and technology agreements with China regardless of whether the U.S.-PRC STA had lapsed. But the strengthened STA language, as well as bolstered national security protections on which U.S. officials have engaged international counterparts, will be more helpful in providing well-considered guardrails for other U.S. partners to emulate or draw from than if Washington had just shut down science and technology cooperation with China.\n\nU.S. officials will emphasize publicly\u2014as they should\u2014that the STA only covers government-to-government cooperation, but there is ample scope for beneficial cooperation outside of government channels. The indirect impact of the agreement and its renewal extends more broadly\u2014both symbolically and tangibly. A U.S. life scientist not in government described the STA to one of us in a discussion on background as a \u201cnormative umbrella\u201d that benefits researchers in the United States and China more broadly.\n\nThe STA establishes clear and consistent best practices that nongovernmental actors can follow in bilateral cooperation. For example, the guidelines and commitments on data-sharing can be pointed to by U.S. and Chinese researchers alike if they are facing obstacles in the Chinese system on sharing data and results from projects outside of China.\n\nCancer research is one crucial area where everyone benefits. Together, China and the United States account for nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s 10 million annual cancer deaths. Better harmonization of clinical trials of cancer therapies could reduce global cancer-related deaths by an estimated 10 percent to 20 percent, or 1 million to 2 million lives per year, according to a Bloomberg International Cancer Coalition study.\n\nWhile geopolitics may seem daunting, history offers a powerful lesson: In 1966, during the height of the Cold War, U.S. scientist Donald Henderson and a Soviet deputy health minister joined forces to eradicate smallpox, which had killed approximately 300 million people in the 20th century alone. By 1980, the World Health Organization announced that smallpox had been eliminated worldwide.\n\nIf this kind of cooperation was possible then, there is every reason to believe that the United States and China can come together now to fight cancer. The amended STA provides renewed space for fruitful collaboration in areas that may prove to be lifesaving for both Chinese and Americans.",

                "text": "The highlights this week: Major shifts in Afghanistan and Bangladesh lead to unexpected diplomatic developments for India and Pakistan, India\u2019s army chief announces that it won\u2019t reduce troops on its disputed border with China this winter, and Pakistani officials hold a third round of talks with the country\u2019s opposition amid tensions.\n\nWelcome to Foreign Policy\u2019s South Asia Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: Major shifts in Afghanistan and Bangladesh lead to unexpected diplomatic developments for India and Pakistan, India\u2019s army chief announces that it won\u2019t reduce troops on its disputed border with China this winter, and Pakistani officials hold a third round of talks with the country\u2019s opposition amid tensions.\n\nSign up to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\nSouth Asia\u2019s Bilateral Surprises\n\nIn 2021, South Asia saw the end of one of its longest-running conflicts: the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Last year, the 15-year rule of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2014one of the region\u2019s longest-serving leaders\u2014came to a close.\n\nThese shifts have ushered in two surprising diplomatic developments: deepening engagement between India and the Taliban and a slowly growing Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship.\n\nSince the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021, Indian officials have held meetings with the group\u2019s leaders. India partially reopened its embassy in Kabul in 2022, indicating its willingness to engage with the regime. And last week, one of India\u2019s top diplomats, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, met with Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Doha, Qatar, to discuss security and economic issues.\n\nThis high-level engagement is remarkable because the Taliban relied heavily on wartime support from India\u2019s rival Pakistan. Taliban forces attacked Indian targets during the conflict, including a bombing outside the Indian Embassy in Kabul in 2009. The Taliban have also harbored links to the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which New Delhi blamed for an attack on the Indian consulate in Herat, Afghanistan, in 2014.\n\nThe end of the war lessened Pakistani leverage over the Taliban. In the years since, the group has refused to curb anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan, provoking tensions with Islamabad. This has given India more space to engage and pursue its own core interests in Afghanistan: ensuring that Afghan soil isn\u2019t used to threaten India and working to strengthen trade and connectivity links to Iran and Central Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh\u2019s interim government, met with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in New York last September and called for strengthening ties. In November, a Pakistani cargo ship docked in a Bangladeshi port for the first time since the latter\u2019s independence. And on Saturday, Dhaka announced a loosening of rules for Pakistani visa applicants.\n\nThese are dramatic developments in a relationship that has long struggled, mainly because of the legacy of Bangladesh\u2019s independence war in 1971. The Pakistani military perpetrated acts of brutality\u2014described by many experts as genocide\u2014in a bid to suppress independence fighters.\n\nHasina was especially resistant to improving relations during her time as prime minister. Her political party (at the time led by her father) had spearheaded Bangladesh\u2019s independence fight; a bitter political rival, the Jamaat-e-Islami party, collaborated with Pakistan during the 1971 war. Hasina\u2019s resignation under pressure last August left a vacuum filled by several actors, including Yunus, who are more inclined to explore partnership with Pakistan.\n\nThough the once-strong ties between Pakistan and the Taliban and between India and Bangladesh are casualties of these new dynamics, these damaged relationships haven\u2019t changed as much as one might think. The shifts are jolting, but the main takeaway isn\u2019t terribly new: The realignment reflects the latest chapter in the India-Pakistan rivalry.\n\nThe two countries have long competed for influence in Afghanistan, where India now seems to have the upper hand. And Pakistan\u2019s burgeoning relations with Bangladesh mean that Islamabad gains a friend in a part of the region where it has none aside from Sri Lanka.\n\nCloser engagement with Bangladesh also gives Pakistan influence in a country that borders volatile and sensitive northeast India. New Delhi hasn\u2019t forgotten the massive arms shipment that was destined for rebels within its borders before it was intercepted in Bangladesh in 2004; it saw pro-Pakistan Bangladeshi officials and Pakistan intelligence as responsible.\n\nUltimately, the India-Pakistan rivalry still casts a long shadow over South Asia, which has already seen it play out in painful ways\u2014from armed conflict in the past to paralysis within regional organizations that prevents collaborations on shared challenges such as climate change. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nIndia won\u2019t reduce troops on Chinese border. On Monday, India\u2019s army chief, Upendra Dwivedi, made some telling comments about the status of India-China relations. Though Dwivedi said that tensions have eased since a deadly clash at the border of Ladakh and Tibet in 2020, he indicated that India will not reduce the number of troops on their disputed border when winter weather conditions become especially inhospitable, as is customary.\n\nDwivedi\u2019s comments reveal that tensions linger nearly five years after the clash in Ladakh, the deadliest border crisis since India and China went to war in 1962. Even after a deal concluded last October to resume border patrols and restore the positions of some troops to pre-crisis locations, mistrust still prevails along the 2,100-mile frontier.\n\nThe decision is also a reminder that the October deal shouldn\u2019t be seen as a precursor to a broader d\u00e9tente between India and China, especially since the relationship is still shaped by entrenched disagreements on a range of issues and intensifying strategic competition.\n\nPakistani opposition talks continue. On Thursday, Pakistani officials will hold a third round of talks with the country\u2019s beleaguered political opposition. The first two rounds came in late December and early January.\n\nThe talks are an encouraging development after several years of deep tensions between the government and opposition, fueled in part by large-scale crackdowns on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023 on charges that his supporters describe as politically motivated.\n\nThat the third round of talks is happening at all is significant, given the limited progress of the first two. PTI has called for a judicial inquiry into two incidents: violent political protests in May 2023 that targeted military facilities, which the government says that PTI was behind; and a crackdown against PTI protesters in Islamabad in November 2024, which PTI claims caused mass casualties.\n\nPTI has also unsuccessfully demanded more access to Khan to discuss the ongoing talks. Time may be running out: PTI negotiators have threatened to end talks if the government doesn\u2019t launch the inquiries by Jan. 31.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Dissanayake in China. On Tuesday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake arrived in Beijing for a four-day state visit. His agenda includes meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top officials on a range of issues, including Sri Lanka\u2019s debt and Chinese infrastructure projects.\n\nThis marks Dissayanake\u2019s second foreign visit since taking office last year; his first was to India in December. The Sri Lankan president\u2019s travel reflects how he, much like other new leaders in the region, is looking to better balance ties with New Delhi and Beijing.\n\nIndia will closely watch one aspect of the trip: The meetings are expected to address the issue of Chinese research vessels in Sri Lanka, which India alleges engage in spycraft. Dissanayake\u2019s predecessor banned the docking of such craft in Sri Lanka for one year, and the moratorium ended earlier this month. Dissanayake hasn\u2019t indicated that he will extend it, but he has said that Sri Lankan soil won\u2019t be used to threaten India.\n\nUnder the Radar\n\nAfghanistan International, a London-based news outlet, recently reported that Jeff Rigsby, an American living in Afghanistan, was found dead in his home in Kabul in November. Rigsby was one of a few U.S. citizens known to be based in Afghanistan.\n\nRigsby, who frequently posted well-informed threads about Afghanistan on his X account, had spent time in the country during the U.S.-led war before returning to live there in 2022, after the Taliban takeover. Other Americans known to be in Afghanistan are there under different conditions: At least three are held captive by the Taliban.\n\nThe Biden administration prioritized making efforts to try to secure their freedom\u2014a focus that will likely be maintained by the Trump administration.\n\nRigsby\u2019s cause of death is unclear. There is speculation that he was killed\u2014by the Taliban or possibly by others motivated by discomfort with investigative work he did on lead poisoning. Others believe that he died of natural causes. There are also many questions about Rigsby himself, including what his profession was and why he decided to settle in Afghanistan.\n\nRigsby\u2019s friends, however, say that he enjoyed being in Afghanistan and that he died in a place that he loved.\n\nFP\u2019s Most Read This Week\n\nRegional Voices\n\nIn the Daily Star, assistant editor Badiuzzaman Bay highlights recent cases of Indian border guards killing Bangladesh civilians. \u201cIndia has too many unresolved issues with Bangladesh \u2026 to let these manageable crises fester unnecessarily,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut if it continues its uncooperative stance, Bangladesh should consider taking the issue to the international court.\u201d\n\nIn the Print, journalist Karanjeet Kaur laments the recent trend of senior Indian business leaders calling on Indian workers to put in more hours with no offer of overtime pay. \u201cIndia\u2019s most respected business leaders and start-up founders have made a habit of displaying just how deeply disconnected they are from the realities of working people\u2019s lives,\u201d she writes.\n\nIn the Express Tribune, scholar Muhammad Ahsan Khan argues that Pakistan should address its agricultural challenges by resorting to vertical farming, which involves growing crops in stacked layers under controlled conditions. \u201cIts ability to grow more crops using fewer resources in urban environments offers hope for a more resilient and sustainable food system in Pakistan,\u201d he writes.",

                "text": "The social media app, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been under attack for the past five years by U.S. politicians who see it as a potent threat to the country\u2019s national security.\n\nIn the United States, presidents come and go, but so far TikTok has endured. That may be about to change, though.\n\nIn the United States, presidents come and go, but so far TikTok has endured. That may be about to change, though.\n\nThe social media app, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has been under attack for the past five years by U.S. politicians who see it as a potent threat to the country\u2019s national security.\n\nThose politicians finally got their big win on Friday. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law signed by President Joe Biden last April that mandated that ByteDance sell TikTok within 270 days or face a ban in the United States. According to that timeline, TikTok\u2019s clock runs out on Sunday, Jan. 19\u2014the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office for the second time.\n\nTrump, who promised on the campaign trail that he would \u201csave\u201d TikTok, may be the best bet for the platform and its roughly 170 million American users. In late December, he filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to delay a ban until he takes office so he can \u201cpursue a political resolution.\u201d\n\nTrump might still get that opportunity despite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Political momentum to give TikTok a stay of execution has also been gathering, with four Democratic lawmakers proposing an extension to the ban deadline earlier this week (though it\u2019s unlikely to be voted on) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying on Thursday that \u201cit\u2019s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer for TikTok.\u201d The Biden administration has also indicated it will leave it to Trump to actually enforce the ban.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThough he has now emerged as TikTok\u2019s most likely savior, Trump was the one who first sought to ban the app during his first term over national security concerns regarding the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s access to data about the app\u2019s American users. That ban, imposed via executive order, was overturned by Biden in 2021 after multiple courts blocked Trump\u2019s order.\n\nEfforts to reach a compromise on TikTok\u2019s ability to continue operating in the United States started and sputtered several times during Biden\u2019s term. Those efforts included a multiyear review by the Treasury Department\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and a TikTok-led initiative known as Project Texas, which would wall off the app\u2019s U.S. user data in a system run by American tech giant Oracle, which U.S. officials deemed insufficient to assuage their concerns.\n\nThose concerns continued to snowball even as TikTok added tens of millions of users in the United States\u2014including accounts for both leading presidential campaigns during the 2024 election season. But sustained pressure in Congress from China hawks on both sides of the aisle finally resulted in an overwhelming vote in favor of the new divest-or-ban measure, which was folded into a broader national security supplemental bill that Biden signed into law in April.\n\nThe congressional coalescence around a TikTok ban forced Biden\u2019s hand after months of negotiations, said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University. The Biden administration \u201csat on their hands, despite this supposedly very urgent national security threat to the country, as more and more people joined TikTok,\u201d Chander said. \u201cThey always had that authority; they just weren\u2019t willing to exercise it,\u201d he added.\n\nNow, TikTok finds itself turning back to Trump for a rescue. The platform\u2019s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, was among the many technology executives who visited the incoming president at Trump\u2019s country club, Mar-a-Lago, last month following the election, and Chew is reportedly planning to attend the inauguration on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe best-case scenario is for the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional as applied to TikTok,\u201d said Chander, \u201cbut they [TikTok] would be happy if they get a delay \u2026 which would allow President Trump to weigh in with potentially a different national security assessment.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBy the letter of the law, TikTok will be illegal in the United States starting Sunday. The law states that no U.S. entity can \u201cdistribute, maintain, or update\u201d the app, which means that app stores that make TikTok available for download\u2014such as those run by Apple and Google\u2014or internet providers that enable access to it would be in violation.\n\nThose who already have TikTok on their phones could theoretically continue to access it, but the company reportedly plans to take its platform completely offline on Sunday once the ban goes into effect. According to a report by the Information citing sources familiar with the matter, Americans who try to access TikTok will instead be redirected to a website with information about the ban. A TikTok spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Foreign Policy.\n\nAs the law states, however, those eventualities could either be precluded (in the next three days) or reversed (anytime after Jan. 19) in the event that ByteDance agrees to sell TikTok.\n\nWho might buy it?\n\nAs with most other aspects of the TikTok ban, we\u2019ve been here before. In his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal to divest TikTok of its Chinese ownership, and a group jointly led by tech firm Oracle and retailer Walmart even agreed to purchase the platform. But that deal was shelved after Biden took office in 2021.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, who served as the U.S. treasury secretary during Trump\u2019s first administration, expressed interest last year in putting together an investor group to buy TikTok.\n\nMultiple reports this week suggest that officials in China\u2014which has consistently said it would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d a sale of TikTok\u2014may be coming around to billionaire Elon Musk as a potential buyer. Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has developed close ties to both China and Trump.\n\nThe most comprehensive and concrete bid, however, has come from billionaire Frank McCourt. McCourt, the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, established an initiative in 2021 called Project Liberty, which aims to create a decentralized version of the internet where users have control over their individual data.\n\n\u201cWe think that that\u2019s the next era of the internet, and that\u2019s going to happen with or without a purchase of TikTok,\u201d McCourt said in an interview with Foreign Policy this week. \u201cWe just think that buying U.S. TikTok would accelerate things and compress time, so to speak, so that this alternative upgraded internet would have scale\u2014and therefore relevance\u2014sooner,\u201d he added.\n\nProject Liberty has put together a consortium of investors that is calling itself the People\u2019s Bid for TikTok. The consortium made a formal proposal to ByteDance last week, which McCourt said the Chinese firm has acknowledged receiving but hasn\u2019t otherwise responded to. McCourt declined to comment on how much the consortium has offered, but he has previously said that he has secured commitments of about $20 billion to purchase the platform.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the consortium is willing to purchase TikTok without the algorithm that powers its video recommendation engine\u2014an algorithm that China has placed restrictions on the sale of.\n\n\u201cAs a business person, I always look for solutions where everybody is winning a little something,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve come forward with seems to me to address all the stakeholders and is something in it for them: With President-elect Trump, it\u2019s avoiding a ban; with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping], it\u2019s addressing his concerns about the algorithm and Chinese intellectual property; with the investors, it\u2019s being able to get a return on investment as opposed to having it wiped out if the app is just shut down; for American citizens, it\u2019s protecting them from no longer being surveilled by a foreign adversary; and for TikTok users, the app stays lit up.\u201d\n\nHow will China react?\n\nBeyond its vocal opposition to a forced sale of TikTok and its restrictions on the sale of the app\u2019s algorithms, the Chinese government has largely distanced itself from the debate around the app\u2014at least publicly.\n\nBut to some experts, the U.S. crusade against TikTok has played right into Beijing\u2019s hands, geopolitically speaking.\n\n\u201cMy heterodox view is that China would be happy to see TikTok banned in the United States. It doesn\u2019t care about TikTok\u2019s future in the United States,\u201d said Chander, the Georgetown University professor. He added, \u201cInstead, it cares that this is yet another demonstration that U.S. professions of embracing free expression, liberalism, and speech across frontiers are really self-interested and not ultimately reliable.\u201d\n\nThe underlying problem may lie more on the U.S. domestic front, according to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. In the absence of meaningful privacy regulations, Chinese spies have many more avenues to gain access to data about American citizens, such as buying it from data brokers.\n\nPrivacy regulations \u201care the things that will actually solve the problem that this TikTok issue is trying to solve, and at the same time will avoid the kind of hit to reputation that America is taking on the global stage by pursuing this ban when it claims to champion an open and free and interoperable internet,\u201d Thibaut said. \u201cFraming the risk of Americans\u2019 data security as a problem that can be solved by banning TikTok leaves a wider and arguably more consequential swath of American data unprotected and available for purchase.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s commitment to free speech faces a more immediate test no matter what happens to TikTok\u2014as a ban looms, the most downloaded app among leading app stores in the United States this week was another Chinese social media app called Xiaohongshu, which means \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d but uses \u201cRedNote\u201d as its English name.\n\nThe app, which has an interface similar to TikTok\u2019s, has been flooded with thousands of new American users calling themselves \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d and has become a rare space for American and Chinese netizens to interact. While that camaraderie is unlikely to last long, given China\u2019s strict controls over its own internet apps, RedNote\u2019s surge in popularity lays bare the potential downside of Washington\u2019s elevation of TikTok as public enemy No. 1 and the precedent a TikTok ban might set for online speech and U.S.-China tech competition. (This week\u2019s second-most downloaded app was Lemon8, another video platform owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching this Xiaohongshu thing, and it just really epitomizes the futility of this whack-a-mole approach\u201d by Washington toward Chinese tech, Thibaut said. \u201cIt\u2019s been like the delight of Chinese state media right now\u2014it\u2019s been such a propaganda boon for them to talk about on their platforms.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Thibaut argues that China may have also backed itself into a corner with its rhetoric around TikTok, regardless of any back-channeling or dealmaking that Trump or Musk might be amenable to.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of tied their hands a bit\u2014the Chinese public would excoriate them if they ended up selling TikTok, one of the biggest examples of Chinese companies being world leaders in tech,\u201d she said. \u201cWould they sell TikTok as a way to avoid tariffs? That would be seen as a huge capitulation by their own setup \u2026 that would be a hard sell to the Chinese public.\u201d",

                "text": "The highlights this week: The U.S. Supreme Court holds hearings on the legitimacy of the TikTok ban passed last year, the rescue of a Chinese actor kidnapped by a Myanmar gang draws attention to cross-border crime, and Chinese drone giant DJI lifts geofencing restrictions in the United States and parts of Europe.\n\nWelcome to Foreign Policy\u2019s China Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: The U.S. Supreme Court holds hearings on the legitimacy of the TikTok ban passed last year, the rescue of a Chinese actor kidnapped by a Myanmar gang draws attention to cross-border crime, and Chinese drone giant DJI lifts geofencing restrictions in the United States and parts of Europe.\n\nSign up to receive China Brief in your inbox every Tuesday.\n\nSupreme Court Likely to Uphold TikTok Ban\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is holding hearings on the legitimacy of the TikTok ban passed by Congress last year on national security grounds, and all signs indicate that the court will uphold the law, closing TikTok\u2019s last appeal.\n\nThe law, which bans the Chinese-owned app unless it is sold, passed with bipartisan support last April and takes effect on Jan. 19. China has protested the legislation\u2014despite operating a closed social media environment within its own borders, where most global apps are banned and those that aren\u2019t operate under tight censorship.\n\nTikTok, which is headquartered in Singapore, has always denied that the Chinese government has any control over its business activities. But this is unrealistic: TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is a Chinese firm\u2014and thus has no power to resist central government demands (either legally or practically), even beyond China\u2019s borders.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there is no smoking gun showing direct orders from Chinese authorities to TikTok. Some research has demonstrated that the app\u2019s algorithms favor pro-China content and mute coverage of human rights issues, as well as individual cases of discrimination. There is also substantial evidence that Chinese employees of ByteDance have accessed U.S. users\u2019 data.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who supported a TikTok ban but failed to implement one during his first term, did a U-turn on the app last year, largely assumed to be influenced by major Republican donor and TikTok investor Jeff Yass. But Trump\u2019s options might be limited, given that lawmakers are likely reluctant to undo the ban.\n\nThat leaves the possibility of a deal: ideally for Trump, the sale of TikTok to one of his ideological allies. The president-elect attempted to broker a deal in 2020 for Oracle to buy TikTok, which fell through. Bloomberg reports that the Chinese government is considering a sale to X owner Elon Musk, who has been tapped for a role in the Trump administration.\n\nTikTok has denied the Bloomberg reporting, calling it \u201cfiction,\u201d but the company has every reason to deny that the Chinese government holds ultimate decision-making power over its fate.\n\nFrom China\u2019s point of view, Musk acquiring TikTok\u2014effectively putting a major source of influence in Trump\u2019s hands\u2014could be a bribe to the new U.S. president. Users might flee a Musk-owned TikTok, as many did from X following Trump\u2019s election victory in November, but the platform could also be a potent propaganda outlet under new ownership.\n\nTikTok users are furious about the U.S. ban, but a previous effort to rally supporters against the law misfired. As lawmakers were inundated with phone calls, the mood turned more sharply against the company. Now, some users have turned to two other Chinese social media apps: Xiaohongshu, which means \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d but is rendered as \u201cRedNote\u201d in English, and Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance.\n\nIt is unlikely that these users will stick around: Both apps are subject to China\u2019s censorship regime, which would ban most of the political, LGBTQ, or creative content that users say they value on TikTok. But the shift signals a possible future of the United States playing whack-a-mole with successful Chinese-owned apps, barring the passage of a more sweeping law.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nCriminal groups in Myanmar. The rescue of a young Chinese actor from a Myanmar criminal syndicate has once again brought public attention to the kidnapping of Chinese citizens by gangs based in the country. Wang Xing traveled to Thailand believing that he was being recruited for a film but was seized by armed men in the Thai border town of Mae Sot.\n\nThe actor was taken to Myanmar and forced to participate in an online operation carrying out so-called pig butchering scams. Wang\u2019s rescue came after a campaign by his girlfriend went viral, prompting intervention by the Thai military. Myanmar gangs favor coerced Chinese labor for these operations; actors such as Wang and influencers have been targeted recently. Chinese films such as No More Bets seek to call attention to the problem.\n\nCriminal groups in Myanmar, which are linked to both the country\u2019s ruling military and rebel militias, have dismantled some operations along the Myanmar-China border, facing pressure from Beijing. Some gang bosses were also delivered to China, despite previously enjoying Chinese support.\n\nThat may explain the shift of operations to the Thai border, but the latest case is likely to mean that Beijing leans heavily on Bangkok to crack down on cross-border crime.\n\nA bad sign for Taiwan? China is building landing vessels designed for an amphibious assault of the kind that would be needed for an invasion of Taiwan, Naval News reports. The ships, under construction at Guangzhou Shipyard by a military firm under direct control of the Chinese government, have long bridges for landings at rocky beaches to avoid Taiwan\u2019s heavily defended ports.\n\nCurrently, only three to five of the landing vessels are under construction\u2014not nearly sufficient for an invasion that could involve between 1 million and 2 million troops\u2014but the move is still a worrying sign of China\u2019s desire to have at least the capacity to invade Taiwan in the coming years.\n\nFP\u2019s Most Read This Week\n\nTech and Business\n\nDrone geofencing lifted. In a potentially provocative move, Chinese drone giant DJI has lifted its geofencing restrictions\u2014the built-in limits on flying drones over sensitive or dangerous sites, such as military bases and airports\u2014in the United States and parts of Europe. Rather than a hard lock, drones will now give warnings while flying into restricted airspace.\n\nDJI\u2019s statement says the move intends to put more power and responsibility on users while still complying with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other regulations. But it is a sensitive time for Chinese technology firms in the United States, both because of the incoming Trump administration and the fallout from the Salt Typhoon hack.\n\nA new\u2014though likely ineffective at deterring hacking\u2014round of sanctions over Salt Typhoon is due this week. A move like this could prompt a broader ban on Chinese drones, which are already limited in states such as Florida.\n\nMassive trade surplus. China\u2019s 2024 trade surplus reached nearly $1 trillion, a startling and unprecedented imbalance. This is the result of China\u2019s sheer scale and industrialization; Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s industrial policy push; and the move away from imports to production for many technologies, particularly cars.\n\nWhile factory jobs remained a mainstay of the Chinese economy last year, helping to compensate for a general slowdown, overcapacity is causing economic problems at home and prompting reactions abroad.\n\nChinese businesses are struggling to survive as price competition forces their margins ever lower, and foreign governments are complaining about China\u2019s supposedly unfair industrial policies. The size of the surplus is likely to add fuel to Trump\u2019s efforts to impose heavy tariffs on China once he takes office.",

                "text": "The highlights this week: Panic grows in Washington about the Salt Typhoon hack of U.S. telecommunications, the Chinese Communist Party sends a signal by publishing an internal speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Jan. 1, and the U.S. Defense Department places Chinese tech giant Tencent on a blacklist for military connections.\n\nWelcome to Foreign Policy\u2019s China Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: Panic grows in Washington about the Salt Typhoon hack of U.S. telecommunications, the Chinese Communist Party sends a signal by publishing an internal speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Jan. 1, and the U.S. Defense Department places Chinese tech giant Tencent on a blacklist for military connections.\n\nSign up to receive China Brief in your inbox every Tuesday.\n\nChina\u2019s Hacking Threat\n\nU.S. intelligence and security officials are evincing a growing sense of crisis about the sweeping penetration of U.S. telecommunications networks carried out by the Chinese government-linked Salt Typhoon hacking group in recent years.\n\nThe full extent of Beijing\u2019s success is not yet public, but there has been steady coverage about the number of affected providers and the extent of the breaches since reports about a severe Salt Typhoon cyberattack emerged last September.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials, speaking on background, have described Washington as \u201cscrewed\u201d and the situation as \u201cdevastating.\u201d After initially downplaying the threat, the U.S. government is now encouraging personnel to switch to encrypted messaging apps.\n\nAt the core of this panic are concerns that China was able to get into backdoors set up by the U.S. government for domestic surveillance. Though not confirmed through reporting, some security analysts have publicly expressed a belief that Salt Typhoon penetrated systems authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nThe Salt Typhoon breach has far-reaching implications. There is the question of what China was able to access, which could be phone records; recordings of private communications among U.S. politicians, diplomats, and security officials; or much more.\n\nU.S. officials are supposed to be cautious about using nonsecure communications; you may recall this being front-page news in 2016 and back-page news in 2024. But in practice, people prefer convenience, best security practices are about what\u2019s possible rather than what\u2019s perfect, and confidential discussion has long taken place on nonsecure channels sometimes.\n\nThe bigger question might be what China is able to do with the information, which could provide limited comfort to U.S. officials. Specific penetrations of confidential U.S. channels in the past, such as covert CIA communications, have produced direct and actionable intelligence that allowed China to purge CIA assets and aid allies such as Iran and Russia.\n\nSalt Typhoon may have produced data on a scale that is more difficult for China to process. Limited analytical capacity can hold up Chinese intelligence, especially since there are major obstacles to sharing information internally. In Beijing, people with English-language skills and cultural understanding of the United States are often shut out of sensitive government jobs.\n\nStill, that would mean China is sitting on caches of data that contain key information about U.S. government actions that it hasn\u2019t uncovered yet but could at any time. Salt Typhoon also managed to penetrate parts of the U.S. government that work directly on issues of major concern to Beijing, such as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s sanctions department.\n\nAnd there seems to be little that Washington can meaningfully do in response, other than work on the assumption of compromise. Repeated U.S. criminal indictments of Chinese cybersecurity actors are empty theater that have had little deterrent effect, as the Salt Typhoon operations show.\n\nSalt Typhoon is hardening anti-China consensus in Washington at an already volatile time, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. It\u2019s worth remembering that the United States also uses cyber-espionage against China; though Beijing has denied the hacking, its officials might also privately dismiss U.S. concerns as hypocritical.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t stop the anger in Washington from being real: There is little that infuriates politicians more than the idea of foreign intrusion into private lives, especially their own.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Following\n\nXi\u2019s big speech. On Jan. 1, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) journal Qiushi published a long speech delivered by Chinese President Xi Jinping to an audience of top party leaders in early 2023 (helpfully translated here by Sinocism\u2019s Bill Bishop). A delay between internal speeches and publication is normal\u2014if they are published at all\u2014and it is a form of signaling, especially at the start of the year.\n\nThe speech is typically boring, full of repetition and cliche even by the standards of Chinese government rhetoric. Apart from the usual emphasis on the party above all, what stands out is Xi restating the idea that \u201cthe East is rising while the West is in decline\u201d and that the developing world is looking to China for leadership and order.\n\nThat first idea was prevalent in China after the 2007-08 global financial crisis and amid the general boosterism of the so-called Asian century. But it looks shakier now, given the state of the Chinese economy, and Xi\u2019s emphasis on it may be more about trying to convince other leaders that all is going well than actual belief.\n\nNo letup to purges. In another speech this week, Xi called corruption the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to the CCP and promised that investigations would continue to be relentless. Xi has used anti-corruption as an excuse to purge political foes since he took power; this is easy in China, where corruption is virtually obligatory to participate in the higher levels of official life.\n\nBut this strategy is a double-edged sword. Fears that corruption threatened CCP rule were a major part of what led to Xi being given unusual authority to act in 2013 by a more collective party leadership. After more than a decade of campaigns, though, even allies may be asking why corruption is still the \u201cbiggest threat.\u201d\n\nTech and Business\n\nTencent targeted. Chinese tech and gaming giant Tencent, which owns chunks of many other video game firms worldwide, was listed as a Chinese military-linked company along with a slew of other firms on a new U.S. Defense Department blacklist. The move caused Tencent shares to slide; the company has vigorously protested the move, saying that it has no contacts with the Chinese military.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Shenzhen-based firm is essentially telling the truth. It is almost impossible for any Chinese firm of its scale not to have some dealings with the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, a vast organization with considerable economic holdings that touches many parts of Chinese life. But none of Tencent\u2019s operations suggest immediate applicability to the battlefield.\n\nPandemic panics. News of increasing cases of HMPV\u2014a respiratory virus that circulates regularly in the winter\u2014has stirred fear online in China. But the outbreak is routine: China is a big country where SARS and COVID-19 first emerged, but it also provides a regularly rotating pool of non-dramatic seasonal illnesses.\n\nLike the renewed attention to bird flu in the United States, the focus on HMPV is in part due to the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is now estimated to have killed more than 20 million people worldwide. But it\u2019s also true that both the United States and China\u2014where the rigid zero-COVID policy caused mass protest\u2014are in worse positions now to tackle any pandemic outbreak than they were in late 2019.\n\nFP\u2019s Most Read This Week\n\nA Bit of Culture\n\nIn his posthumously published novella narrated by a beaten-down official, 2010, popular Chinese novelist Wang Xiaobo (1952-97) imagined a near future in which Beijing\u2019s infamously smoggy skies would be replaced in pictures with mandatory technological assistance.\n\nThough officials in the 2000s would regularly photoshop images, the reality proved a little more optimistic: Social media coverage of Beijing\u2019s so-called smogpocalypse in the 2010s was an important factor in reducing pollution.\u2014Brendan O\u2019Kane, translator\n\nExcerpt From 2010\n\nBy Wang Xiaobo\n\nIn 2010, I lived in [the Beijing district of] Beidaihe, beneath a blanket of diesel exhaust. In winter, when the sun came out, all I could see was a sweeping vista of beige. You wouldn\u2019t see this in photos or on TV: By then, every camera came with a blue lens filter attached. Orders from the top.\n\nIt was a sight for the naked eye alone\u2014and if the order came down for everyone to wear blue-tinted glasses, it wouldn\u2019t even be that. The sky would just be a bright last-century blue. It was entirely possible that leadership might issue such an order: It\u2019d take care of all that pesky pollution.",

Some reasons are well known, but they need to be knitted together. And as global challenges that require cooperation, such as climate change and migration, mount, countries will eventually want to draw together again.\n\nAs the disappearance of comfortable middle-class jobs for moderately skilled workers has upended the prior economic and political consensus, the blame has been placed on trade competition. Everyone can see when the local manufacturer closes down and shifts operations to Eastern Europe, Mexico, or China. Yet the more significant killer of routine jobs, by far, is technological change, whether it is the tax accountant losing her job to a software program such as TurboTax or an autoworker displaced by a machine. This is true even in emerging markets\u2014as in India, where much of cellphone assembly, the quintessential low-skill manufacturing job, is now done by machines, not by workers.\n\nArtificial intelligence promises yet more disruption. It is hard, however, to protest steady technological change. Politically, the foreign producer offers an easier target.\n\nAs technological progress hollows out jobs in the middle, global competition for the manufacturing jobs that remain has increased. It used to be that the developed-country worker was far more productive because they were better educated and skilled and had access to better infrastructure, more capital, and more intellectual property. Their higher productivity once offset the higher wages they were paid. This is no longer true in a growing number of sectors: The rest of the world is catching up to, even leapfrogging, the developed world.\n\nFor instance, Chinese electric vehicles are often better and cheaper than EVs made by traditional Western manufacturers because they are designed from the bottom up around the digital core and do not attempt to wrap the new technology around the old motor car. Workers in many emerging markets use the same machines and often work longer for less pay, which is why Apple has not manufactured anything itself since 2004, instead outsourcing manufacturing to firms, such as Foxconn, that produce in the emerging world.\n\nIt is hard to point to any large developed-country government in the post-financial crisis era that has made citizens confident about the future.\n\nTechnological change and foreign competition for the remaining \u201cgood\u201d jobs have also become more salient politically because comfortable middle-class jobs for the moderately skilled were typically filled by men, often from the majority group. They are the ones who are seeing the greatest relative fall in status, especially as today\u2019s good jobs entail more intellectual and less physical work and women are far more able to compete. And unlike the victims of technological change in the past or those in less democratic countries, they are vocal and can organize politically. That, according to the AP VoteCast survey of more than 120,000 voters, 60 percent of white men (versus 53 percent of white women), 48 percent of Latino men (versus 39 percent of Latina women), and 25 percent of Black men (versus 10 percent of Black women) voted for Trump is consistent with which groups are most dissatisfied with continuity, though there are other explanations, of course.\n\nThere is no surefire way to move more workers from precarious jobs to good jobs in the face of technological change. Experimental policies to help workers adapt will take time to show results, and it will take more time for successful experiments to be rolled out widely. A cautionary note is that through the first Industrial Revolution ending in 1840, workers\u2019 wages stagnated in Britain\u2014a phenomenon termed \u201cEngels\u2019s pause.\u201d Only subsequently did livelihoods improve. Worryingly, it is hard to point to any large developed-country government in the post-financial crisis era that has made citizens confident about the future\u2014and that\u2019s even though unemployment across the developed world is at historical lows.\n\nA black and white photo shows two rows of workers in hats leaving together as they lay railroad tracks.\n\nTwo workers, one in a straw hat and one in a construction hat, work atop the roof of a house. A ladder is propped up next to them and partially constructed houses are seen in the distance.\n\n\n\nBut if developed-country workers are hurting from technological change and competition, workers in poor developing countries have it much worse. The prices of many commodities, those countries\u2019 traditional exports, have barely increased in recent years. The growth path followed by successful emerging markets focusing on manufacturing-led exports is narrowing because of protectionism, automation, and extreme competition. In addition, in the global south, traditional livelihoods such as agriculture are threatened by climate change and conflict.\n\nThe pandemic was a further blow\u2014despite the very limited assistance developing-country governments provided their populations, it was enough to push their strained finances over the edge. This was the last straw for many desperate people, and they have set off in rickety boats and through dangerous jungles for the developed world.\n\nUnderstandably, no country wants to be overwhelmed by foreigners. People are attached to their culture and traditions and would rather immigrants assimilate. These broader concerns are accentuated in a left-behind population that sees the immigrant as competing with them.\n\nIn truth, the most desperate immigrants often take jobs that the native population shuns\u2014indeed, that only previous immigrants did, one reason that existing immigrants sometimes oppose new immigration. Immigrants are often a source of energy and vitality, provided they get the right supports initially. With Western populations aging, and their entitlements underfunded over the medium term, sensible immigration policy that accepts both the most and least qualified immigrants in reasonable quantities will keep the workforce younger and ensure a country\u2019s long-run fiscal health.\n\nHowever, any country that adopts reasonable immigration policies today in the otherwise broadly hostile environment understandably fears that it will be swamped\u2014Canada is a recent example. So, what has been the political reaction to these hard-to-solve problems?\n\nA worker in blue protective gear, a mask and gloves holds up a disc-shaped chip to inspect it.\n\nWhen a political party has no answers, there is still a time-tested alternative for gaining popularity: the politics of polarization\u2014that is, blame others and block the sources of change where possible while plying supporters with fiscal largesse.\n\nFor instance, these parties blame globalist elites for opening borders to goods while protecting their own service professions; the diversity and inclusion bureaucracy for opening doors to the supposedly less competent while closing doors for the meritocratic; multinational corporations for urging open borders while moving investment to the cheapest countries; foreign manufacturers for cheating while taking advantage of free trade; and so on.\n\nThe finger-pointing is not entirely baseless. Take, for example, the allegation, often pointed at China, that foreigners cheat. One claim is that China has stolen intellectual property. This is likely true, but as development economist Ha-Joon Chang has argued, so have most countries in their development stage, though perhaps less so than China. Eventually, countries start creating more of their own IP, as the Chinese are now doing in areas such as EVs and batteries, and then they protect IP more. While the desire to punish past actions is understandable, China may well be more willing today to commit to curbing its infractions.\n\nAnother claim is that China subsidizes manufacturers, for instance with cheap credit. This is probably also true. However, every country subsidizes. For instance, the extensive developed-country supports to corporations during the pandemic were subsidies, as is the Federal Reserve and Treasury\u2019s implicit and explicit support to the U.S. financial sector. And now many countries are embracing Chinese-style industrial policy, with government subsidies for key domestic firms that they expect will become national champions in the industries of the future.\n\nIn sum, it is not sufficient to say China subsidizes but rather that it subsidizes more than developed countries. One crude measure of public support is the growth in government indebtedness. By this metric, no country or region is blemish free. A full accounting for subsidies is difficult but necessary\u2014the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have started such analysis, but much more work is needed.\n\nScapegoating the foreigner and trade leads to non-solutions that deflect the domestic debate away from the right reforms.\n\nPerhaps the greatest antidote to subsidies embedded in new industrial policies that governments are embracing is that they rarely work. China has built such massive overcapacity in the industries it helped, such as solar cells and EVs, that few firms are making profits. This experience is likely to be repeated by countries subsidizing chip manufacturing. Eventually, experience will compel governments to back off from intervening.\n\nIn the meantime, however, scapegoating the foreigner and trade leads to non-solutions that deflect the domestic debate away from the right reforms. For instance, the United States already applies substantial tariffs on solar panels from China. In response, China exports solar cells to third countries, which assemble them into panels and then reexport them with a hefty markup to the United States. The shift from direct trade to indirect trade is self-defeating in so many ways, including hampering the fight against climate change. Even if panel imports were somehow stopped altogether and U.S. manufacturers did produce them, it would not create many U.S. jobs\u2014given the high cost of labor in the United States, manufacturers would more likely use machines rather than workers, as we have seen Indian manufacturers do.\n\nIf the U.S. trade deficit is seen as a weakness, it would make far more sense to bring it down by reducing the fiscal deficit, since trade deficits reflect, in part, an excess of domestic spending over saving. Conversely, if China views its trade surplus\u2014a measure of its dependence on foreign consumers\u2014as a vulnerability, the solution is to adopt domestic policies that would boost household confidence, encouraging Chinese households to consume more. The United States and China could have a useful dialogue on how each other\u2019s domestic actions (or lack of them) are creating global vulnerabilities.\n\nInstead, as the two superpowers point the finger at each other in an environment of rising geopolitical rivalry, distrust and fragmentation increase. For instance, multi-national firms have learned that their supply chains need to become more resilient to disruptions. And the Russia-Ukraine war has taught countries not to be dependent on a potential enemy for key inputs. There are sensible ways to achieve more resilience and national security. But in a polarizing world, everyone is a potential enemy, and every product is capable of being weaponized, so these needs become the cover for blatant protectionism on even the most quotidian products.\n\nThe unfortunate implication of finger-pointing is that we can be better off by eliminating the ostensible source of disruption. Almost surely, that will not take us back to the much-romanticized past. Not only will the U.S. manufacturing jobs lost to China typically not come back if the United States only applies tariffs, but any effective reshoring of production through more draconian government actions against imports will increase costs. It will render the U.S. airplane exporter\u2014which now has to use high-cost U.S. steel\u2014less competitive, even if retaliatory protectionism does not hit its sales. It will reduce household consumption, as the earphones that used to cost $50 now retail for $100. And it will reduce foreign incomes so that foreigners can afford fewer U.S. goods. Each of these hurts U.S. job creation. Protectionism helped trigger the Great Depression. Few should want to go back to that past, yet so many want to experiment with past follies again.\n\nA line of migrants are silhouetted against a glowing sky with bare brances of a tree above them.\n\nWhile history suggests what will not work, it offers no magic solutions on how to enable workforces to adapt continuously to technological change. But I want to point to two reasons for hope that the trend toward isolationism will eventually be arrested.\n\nFirst, the electorate, while willing to try anything, wants real solutions. As the polarizers fail, they are thrown out, so long as their countries stay democratic; the United Kingdom and Poland are recent examples. Countries will get windows for sensible reforms, and, hopefully, examples of success will emerge.\n\nSecond, many emerging markets and developing countries want to maintain an open world. They will be partners in any effort to construct a new open order, even if the largest economies stay aloof for now. Coalitions of the willing must create foundations for that new order, with others joining as their domestic politics change.\n\nOn the domestic side, countries need to equip people for the work of the future, even if the full payoff will come only with time. Wherever possible, arrangements to do so are better coordinated by local government than at the federal or state level.\n\nCountries that seem to have prepared their workers best for technological change are small, decentralized ones such as Switzerland or the Scandinavian economies. Reforms to the ways that countries have of reskilling workers may be more appropriate if designed and implemented locally, as local government, businesses, NGOs, and educational institutions come together to find solutions. This also allows for multiple simultaneous experiments to find out what works.\n\nMore generally, an antidote to the sense of helplessness induced by massive global change is local empowerment, with light-touch federal support where needed. The guiding principle should be that of subsidiarity\u2014devolving powers to the lowest level that can exercise them.\n\nWhile respecting the principle of subsidiarity, we do need to move forward at the global level. Let me sketch three possible areas.\n\nFor one, we need climate action among the willing, else migration will be the only option in poor countries. Country actions should be differentiated based on capacity and need, a principle more honored in the breach than the observance. Developed countries and emerging markets should take on the burden of mitigating emissions and finding robust ways of financing the necessary investments. More specifically, the world needs better measurement and disclosure of emissions and mitigation efforts and clearer national commitments to do so; enhanced carbon-trading opportunities; agreements to exempt green goods from trade protectionism with, if necessary, temporary and limited safeguards to allow domestic industry time to adjust; and greater sharing of green IP.\n\nDeveloping countries, which face growing climate calamities today, should focus their scarce resources on helping their people to adapt to climate change\u2014for instance, moving homes to higher ground, expanding water harvesting and irrigation, or growing hardier crops\u2014while ensuring that new investment is green. Of course, as developed countries perfect ways of financing green investment, developing countries can use them to attract capital and replace old high-emission capital stock.\n\nSecond, we must preserve the momentum for greater openness in other areas as goods trade becomes protectionist. Specifically, improvements in communications technology now allow high-skill services such as consulting, telemedicine, retail financial services, and design to be provided at a distance. Global services trade, already growing faster than goods trade, can explode if we bring down barriers.\n\nImportantly, developed economies have a comparative advantage here; the world\u2019s biggest exporter of services is the United States, followed by the U.K. However, service exports also offer an alternative growth path for developing economies. To expand service exports, including from developing countries, we need global agreements on issues such as mutual degree recognition, data privacy and storage, and adequate digital infrastructure to support services trade.\n\nOpening up services trade has other benefits. Capable professionals in developing countries can earn good incomes from abroad without emigrating, boosting the local economy with their consumption. Domestic inequality in developed countries will fall as competition increases in previously protected highly paid professional services, increasing their availability and reducing their price. Growth in services consumption is also more environmentally sustainable than goods consumption.\n\nFinally, multilateral institutions have been ineffective thus far in fighting fragmentation, in part because they are dominated by increasingly protectionist developed countries. We must make them fit for purpose through reforms while envisaging new institutions, such as a World Immigration Organization, that will help inform and coordinate country efforts.\n\nFor instance, consider the IMF, which was set up with power vested in an executive board dominated by the United States and its allies. Even today, this board micromanages everything down to operational decisions, such as who gets loans.\n\nCross-border trade, investment, and migration have made the world far more prosperous than could ever have been imagined, but fragmentation will make us poorer.\n\nNot surprisingly, the old powers do not want to cede board power to rising economies. It is telling that China has voting power only as large as Japan at the IMF even though its economy is more than four times bigger; however, the IMF\u2019s December 2023 quota review made no change in relative votes. Rising powers therefore do not trust the IMF to be evenhanded, which makes it less able to mediate conflicts and disagreements between countries.\n\nA key reform would be to take executive powers such as individual loan decisions away from the IMF board, vesting them in a technocratic professional management with allegiance to the organizational mission, while making the board responsible only for overall governance. This would depoliticize operational decisions and analysis, making the IMF more trusted and able to come up with unbiased proposals for global problems. It would also make the old powers more willing to cede their dominance since the rising powers would not control operational decisions. Interestingly, it is what economist John Maynard Keynes recommended when the IMF was set up, only to be overruled by the United States.\n\nSimilar reforms are possible in other institutions such as the World Bank and the WTO. No doubt the United States will still resist somewhat, but it has come a long way from when President John F. Kennedy said that \u201cwe shall pay any price, bear any burden \u2026 to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\u201d Other nations ceded power to Washington because it was willing to fill gaps with its resources and military. With the United States now wanting other nations to assume their fair share of responsibility, it should also be prepared to share power in multilateral institutions. The alternative is to see them become irrelevant.\n\nCross-border trade, investment, and migration have made the world far more prosperous than could ever have been imagined, but fragmentation will make us poorer. The U.S. election was just one act in an unfolding play. We must resist the play\u2019s overall theme that isolationism will make every nation great again.\n\nSuccesses will be few and far between for a while. Unlike in the past, we have much less belief in a shared destiny\u2014that countries benefit when others are successful, that we can come together to solve the gigantic problems we face. That belief will return more strongly, if nothing else, as we experience the costs of isolationism. The task today is therefore to tackle the root causes of fragmentation, preserve openness where we can, and build necessary institutions where possible so we can regain lost ground and time quickly when that moment arrives.",

                "text": "This reformist and philosophically aligned duo, rare in Lebanon\u2019s modern history, could usher a new political era in the country\u2014one that could start to rehabilitate a paralyzed system, a broken economy, and a deeply wounded nation that has incredible potential.\n\nFor the first time since 1958, there is reason for hope in Lebanon. That hope lies today in the rise of two Lebanese public figures who served their country ably over many years: Gen. Joseph Aoun, a former Lebanese army commander who will now serve as president, and Nawaf Salam, Lebanon\u2019s former United Nations ambassador who will assume the role of prime minister.\n\nFor the first time since 1958, there is reason for hope in Lebanon. That hope lies today in the rise of two Lebanese public figures who served their country ably over many years: Gen. Joseph Aoun, a former Lebanese army commander who will now serve as president, and Nawaf Salam, Lebanon\u2019s former United Nations ambassador who will assume the role of prime minister.\n\nThis reformist and philosophically aligned duo, rare in Lebanon\u2019s modern history, could usher a new political era in the country\u2014one that could start to rehabilitate a paralyzed system, a broken economy, and a deeply wounded nation that has incredible potential.\n\nAs they did 67 years ago, the Lebanese picked their president from within the military. They had little trust in any of the other candidates\u2014the usual faces of the old feudal system\u2014and viewed Aoun as a nonpartisan outsider who outperformed in his mission to reform the Lebanese army and could champion real change in politics.\n\nAs in 1958, when Lebanese lawmakers elected Fuad Chehab as president, Aoun is coming to the presidency during tumultuous times in the country and the region overall. Back then, the Lebanese were bitterly divided over the political direction and foreign-policy orientation of their country, leading to clashes in the streets.\n\nThe Lebanese are still bitterly divided but have now found consensus in Aoun, who, like Chehab, had shown no interest in entering the political field until it became clear that he was the only candidate who had any hope of wide acceptance by both the Lebanese people and foreign powers. Undoubtedly, the United States is the most influential of those powers in Lebanon, and its recent diplomacy was instrumental in bringing about a cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel after a devastating conflict that lasted more than a year, as well as pushing the electoral process forward in Beirut.\n\nThere is no question that Hezbollah is the biggest loser under the new government. Aoun is the antithesis of everything Hezbollah represents: a state builder who, in his public testimony, said he will commit to fighting corruption and making the army the sole legitimate force in the country.\n\nThe fact that Aoun is favored by Washington and admired by the U.S. military leadership makes him even less attractive to Hezbollah. For several years, Aoun spearheaded major reform of the Lebanese army in close partnership with the United States. In 2017, he led the army in battle to kick Islamic State fighters out of Lebanon, and, more importantly, he turned the army from a decrepit institution into a professional fighting force. He trusted Washington, and Washington trusted him. As president, he will oversee the Lebanese army\u2019s reform program and ensure its continuation, which would serve U.S. interests.\n\nIf Hezbollah is apprehensive about Aoun, it is even more opposed to Salam. Salam is an indefatigable lawyer whose intellect, skills, and integrity earned him the position of president of the International Court of Justice. He is expected to commit Lebanon to the rule of law both at home and abroad, and seek to honor Lebanon\u2019s adherence to U.N. resolutions, starting with Resolution 1559, which calls for disbanding and disarming all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias inside Lebanon, and Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, and, like 1559, requires the disarmament of all armed groups in the country. Obviously, none of this is acceptable to Hezbollah.\n\nBased on the speeches that Hezbollah officials gave after Salam\u2019s nomination, it is clear that the group is distressed. It also feels betrayed. The Aoun pill was a bitter one to swallow, but then came the shock of Salam, which caused Hezbollah to almost choke. The group strongly opposed Salam in previous years and denied him the premiership given his stance against corruption and for justice and reform.\n\nSignificantly weakened following its war with Israel\u2014with a decapitated leadership, a decimated fighting force, and a heavily penetrated security apparatus\u2014Hezbollah had no choice but to compromise and accept Aoun, though with every expectation that Najib Mikati, the departing prime minister who represents the old guard, would retain the premiership.\n\nHowever, in a rare moment of political clarity, Lebanese parliamentarians rejected Mikati and formed a large enough coalition to nominate Salam. How this disparate bunch\u2014who hated each other and bitterly clashed for years\u2014came together in the interest of the nation at the last minute is the stuff of political legend. Washington didn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t dictate this outcome, but it certainly influenced it, along with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe immediate challenge Aoun and Salam face is forming a cabinet that represents the aspirations of all those in Lebanon who desire a new beginning. The broader challenge is dealing with a disgruntled Hezbollah, which is already saying that Salam\u2019s appointment goes against the spirit of national unity, even though it is perfectly legal and constitutional.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially code for Hezbollah politically opposing the next cabinet and possibly resorting to violence. Over the years, Hezbollah has been accused of several assassinations of its domestic opponents, including former prime minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005\u2014a murder that shocked the world and cemented Hezbollah\u2019s dominance in Beirut for two decades.\n\nThen, in 2008, Hezbollah directed its guns internally because it disagreed with the Fuad Siniora-led government\u2019s decision to investigate the group\u2019s telecommunications system. In one swoop, Hezbollah militiamen took over west Beirut in scenes reminiscent of the 1975-1990 civil war. The 2008 crisis ended with the adoption of the Doha Accord, which further institutionalized Hezbollah\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s political system.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Hezbollah today is nowhere near what it was back then, but it is not defeated, and it is still armed and dangerous. Hezbollah\u2019s gameplan and road to recovery is unclear, but it desperately needs international funding to rebuild southern Lebanon, southern Beirut, and other areas where its members and supporters live. And yet, that funding won\u2019t come if the group lashes out and sabotages the next cabinet\u2014creating a major dilemma for its surviving leaders.\n\nAoun, Salam, and their supporters must not take their foot off the pedal. In no way are the Lebanese obligated to entertain Hezbollah\u2019s wishes or conditions. They have followed the democratic process and have done everything by the book. As they form the next cabinet, Aoun and Salam must only choose ministers who are committed to reform, justice, and the rule of law. And there are plenty of competent and independent Shiite candidates to ensure inclusivity.\n\nBut they can\u2019t do it alone. Such bold Lebanese leadership will require the continuous support of Washington and Riyadh, lest history repeat itself.\n\nIn 1958, anti-U.S. factions in Lebanon demanded that President Camille Chamoun, who wanted to extend his term, be removed from office and the United States withdraw its Marines from Lebanon. More than 25 years later, in 1983, the United States rushed to the exit after militants bombed U.S. barracks\u2014the single deadliest day for the U.S. Marine Corps since World War II.\n\nWashington\u2019s departure then allowed Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah to turn Lebanon into a vassal state, committed to undermining U.S. interests and stability in the region.\n\nThe United States should learn from its history of involvement in Lebanon. This time, it has real allies in Beirut who have wide domestic support and a strong mandate for reform. They could lead the country\u2019s political rebirth and deny Iran an opportunity to rebuild its destabilizing influence in the Levant, especially now that the Assad regime in Syria next door has collapsed.",

Many Syrian activists now warn about the instincts of HTS that could lead to the rapid Islamization of Syrian state institutions, potentially antithetical to the revolution itself.\n\nThe Syrian revolution that sparked in 2011 was neither Islamist nor sectarian in origin. Protesters in the early revolutionary phase, inspired by the Arab Spring, were a mix of Syrian nationalists, leftists, secular liberals, and conservative Muslims. But the left-oriented political class was crushed by the Assad regime\u2019s intelligence and security apparatus, which imprisoned, tortured, maimed, and killed tens of thousands of activists.\n\nThe anti-shah protesters who took to the streets in Iran in the year before Khomeini\u2019s triumphant reversal of fortune displayed a similar mix of banners. The Iranian left, which was close to challenging the Islamists in early 1979, was eclipsed and banished politically. A similar concern periodically punctured the Syrian revolution, as questions arose about a Salafi hijacking of the revolution as the number of armed Islamist fighters swelled.\n\nConcerns about Syria\u2019s political transition are justified. The country is in the throes of a historic moment that will shape its future for decades. But, in crucial ways, Syria is not Iran in 1979. If the most iconic photographs of the Iranian revolution were those of a turbaned Khomeini returning from exile in February 1979, the transformation of HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa\u2014until recently known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani\u2014from wearing combat fatigues and a turban to a black suit has become a defining image of post-Assad Syria.\n\nA clergyman in a robe holds one fist up and a sign showing Khomeini in the other on a street next to a car.\n\nThe Shiite clergy who swept aside the shah arose from a long theological history of debate and evolution that consolidated the role of ulema\u2014scholars trained in Islamic law, or sharia\u2014in Iran.\n\nAs Khomeini consolidated his influence after the overthrow of the interim government that was installed after the shah fled Tehran, his principal aim was to implement the religious system of governance that he had laid out in his lectures-turned-book, Hokumat-e Eslami (Islamic Government), which set out the principle of velayat-e faqih\u2014guardianship by Islamic jurists authorized to interpret, implement, and monitor the application of sharia in all aspects of society. Later in 1979, the constitution ratified the principle of velayat-e faqih, with the supreme clerical leader overseeing the top-down Islamization of state and society.\n\nThe playbook that Sharaa and his followers used to launch militant campaigns to conquer and govern territory and to recruit fighters was premised on a Salafi-Sunni identity. Now, it is hardly surprising that Sharaa\u2019s vision for Syria\u2019s political and legal system will derive from ideas plucked from political Islam. This is a markedly complex transition for an armed jihadi movement with little precedent.\n\nSyria\u2019s new rulers are now demonstrating a sensitization to democratic norms, such as the rights of all sects and religions in Syria and of women. This seems far from a wholesale, theocratic transformation of society in the manner of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution. Despite this, there are signs of pushback within HTS among more conservative ideologues who have a different vision for change.\n\nA recent provisional decision by Syria\u2019s Education Ministry to amend the national curriculum sparked controversy for introducing Islamist language, including defining a martyr as \u201cone who died defending the word of Allah,\u201d and eliminating the theory of evolution from science courses. The government swiftly walked this back amid some criticism, clarifying that these were proposals and that final decisions would be taken by specialist committees.\n\nIslamists have a defeated history in Syria, epitomized by the brutal crackdown, known as the Hama massacre, against the Muslim Brotherhood that began in February 1982. From a regional perspective, the revolutionary outcome in Syria that has ushered in rulers with a Sunni Islamist worldview is a paradigm shift.\n\nUnder the post-Arab Spring status quo, Sunni political groups largely seemed to have failed in taking control of governments. Turkey is an exception, and ironically, it is owing to the outsized influence of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) that Sharaa and his interim government have a shot at accomplishing the political transition to moderation they claim to be serious about.\n\nQatar has already pledged to invest widely in Syria\u2019s energy and transportation infrastructure. It isn\u2019t difficult to imagine that hefty investments from the Gulf emirate, along with signs of Saudi engagement, could lead to an Islamist outcome in Syria. But while Arab Gulf states do not have a governance model to export to Syria, Turkey does. On the flipside, if Sharaa is successful, a case of a Sunni Islamist government in power may raise alarm bells for neighboring states that harbor political Islamist movements with similar aspirations.\n\nCairo has been cautious about its approach to the interim administration so far. So has Amman. The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of Jordan\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, secured nearly a quarter of the seats in the House of Representatives last September. Jordan is plainly concerned about the danger of both Brotherhood political mobilization and Iranian interference that could destabilize the West Bank.\n\nA crowd swarms around Ahmed al-Sharaa who smiles.\n\nThough political Islamist mobilization was less understood in 1979, a lot has changed in the last 45 years. Sharaa\u2019s party could transform, as other political Islamist actors have, toward a hybrid religious-nationalist identity that harnesses Islamic tenets injected with a Syrian nationalism. While not secular, it can profess to be nonsectarian.\n\nSharaa likely believes that large swaths of the Syrian population will buy in to some interpretation of an Islamist-oriented political system over time, as the state bureaucracy expands, infrastructure and service delivery improve, displaced Syrians can return home, and the labor force surges with employment opportunities. Seen this way, he may be paving the way to win hearts and minds while approaching an Islamist end point.\n\nThere will be resistance to this vision. While it was the armed opposition that ultimately toppled Bashar al-Assad, vocal political dissidents and human rights activists have been chipping away at regime pillars at great personal cost. Moreover, Syria has a heterogenous population with sizable non-Muslim and non-Sunni religious affiliations, including Christian Druze, Alawite, Turkmen, and Kurdish groups, that would oppose an institutionalized Sunni Islamist state. There are also the preferences of Syria\u2019s secular urbanites to consider. More friction may be on the horizon if intra-Sunni tensions flare between the Salafis and the Sufi tradition, which holds historic sway in Syria.\n\nThe claims of minorities and ubiquitous recognition of such rights by the international community must stand as a natural bulwark against exclusionary rule. Democracy is the only system that will guarantee the rights of minorities in Syria. In December, thousands of protesters poured onto the streets after a video circulated reportedly showing the desecration of an Alawite shrine. Blamed on disinformation efforts to stoke sectarian violence by former regime loyalists or possibly external spoilers, many images have been discredited. But in the coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia, some Christian and Alawite communities remain on edge.\n\nBeyond the questions of democracy and pluralism is the more immediate concern of a collapsing economy. Sharaa\u2019s government seeks to adopt a free market economic model with links to global markets. The Syrian caretaker government\u2019s immediate goal is to gain international recognition and encourage the United States, European Union, and other actors to lift the complex web of sanctions on the country.\n\nThe U.S.-imposed sanctions date back to 1979, when Syria was designated a state sponsor of terrorism, with subsequent rounds snowballing in the 2000s and then in 2011 in response to Assad\u2019s crackdown on protesters and the ensuing war. U.S. primary and secondary sanctions, which prohibit third parties from engaging with Syria as enshrined with the 2019 Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, equates to a near embargo and is a barrier to constructive engagement with Syria\u2019s new rulers.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the U.S. Treasury Department introduced a six-month waiver on restrictions on Syria\u2019s governing institutions, which will allow the entry of humanitarian aid and ease some financial transactions in the energy sector and personal remittances. While it is a move in the right direction, the sanctions regime remains intact, and the EU and U.K. have yet to follow suit.\n\nIf sanctions are seen as a punitive instrument with no end in sight, this will risk isolating Syria\u2019s rulers and people, fuel anti-Western sentiment, and possibly unleash new cycles of repression and violence fueled by economic despair.\n\nUnlike the political economy of post-revolutionary Iran\u2014which could rely on its vast oil and natural gas reserves\u2014Syria lacks sufficient natural resources that could power its economic revival, and its energy sector is in disarray. It will remain heavily dependent on access to foreign imports and trade for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe prevailing view that the international community should not prematurely abandon the strategic leverage that sanctions afford is narrow and shortsighted. There are policy and legal scenarios in between, such as an incremental, phased approach to sector-specific waivers for some sanctions. None of these impairs the ability to maintain targeted sanctions and asset freezes on individuals and entities responsible for carrying out mass atrocities under the former regime.\n\nImportantly, continuing expansive sanctions mechanisms reduces the ability of the United States and other actors to influence Syria\u2019s caretakers toward democratic reforms. The scale of destruction in Syria after 13 years of war requires multilateral aid and economic investment, including from regional and international states. Washington and London must not be left out of the process of Syria\u2019s transformation, and the country\u2019s new, technocratic rulers may be open to making concessions if they receive tacit guarantees of sanctions relief.\n\nTying sanctions relief to consensus-driven, genuine political reform will extend legitimacy to the new Syrian administration. But there needs to be an articulation of what this would look like rather than a prolonged state of ambiguity.\n\nSharaa and his deputies would do well to assure the international community that they are not pulling a fait accompli or creating facts on the ground in the absence of an electoral mandate. Political and civic groups will need viable opportunities to mobilize, especially during the transition period. The caretaker cabinet is drawn entirely from the Salvation Government in Idlib, but if Sharaa diversified this portfolio, it would send a positive message.\n\nIn late December, Sharaa announced that HTS would disband during the planned national dialogue conference, which will include representatives from across Syria\u2019s governorates. It is important that HTS uses the conference to tangibly demonstrate how it plans to share decision-making with other actors in Syria in non-superficial ways.\n\nThe Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) in exile has stated that \u201cthe implementation of UN Resolution 2254 must occur through a Syrian-led and owned political process, facilitated through Syrian-Syrian dialogue,\u201d referring to the U.N. Security Council resolution that laid out a road map for Syria\u2019s political transition in 2015.\n\nSOC President Hadi al-Bahra called for an inclusive, nonsectarian transitional government and said the group would return to Syria to resume its activities. But political mobilization under the Assad regime was a suicide mission, and there is no infrastructure to support competitive party politics in Syria. While its inclusion in the political process will be necessary, the SOC will have limited influence, especially if HTS holds on to key state functions.\n\nEyes and a wrinkled forehead on a poster are seen over the shoulder of two protesters.\n\nWhile hopes for Iran\u2019s democracy were buried in 1979, it is not a foregone conclusion that Syria must share a similar fate, nor is a sharia-based constitutional system inevitable. Unlike the anti-shah protests in Iran, the main political vocabulary of resistance to the Assad regime was not expressed through Islamism.\n\nThis changed in 2012-13, when the most powerful actors in the revolutionary movement emerged as armed Salafi-jihadi groups, with HTS later elbowing out the competition. Recently, Sharaa said that \u201ceveryone who offered sacrifices liberated the country,\u201d signaling that a big-tent approach and alliance-building across the political spectrum can grant him the legitimacy he seeks.\n\nIt is now up to the Syrian people whether they choose to legitimize Sharaa and his party, but they must be allowed the opportunity to make that decision sooner rather than later.\n\nA prolonged interim government transition risks sociopolitical cleavages becoming more salient, armed groups gaining ground from the bottom up in parts of the country, and a youth frustrated with not having the means to exercise their newfound right to political choice.",

                "text": "Since the late 2010s, Assad\u2019s regime had been involved in the production and trafficking of Captagon, an amphetamine-type stimulant. The drug trade provided Damascus with a crucial financial lifeline during the Syrian civil war, undermining the effects of international sanctions. The regime orchestrated the trade through its security agencies and branches, including the Fourth Armored Division and Air Force Intelligence Directorate, as well as via Assad family members and elite business associates.\n\nEarly last December, opposition fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered the Syrian capital of Damascus, capping a lightning offensive that had captured significant territory in just over one week.

A day later, Syrian dictator and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow by plane. Assad\u2019s ouster unraveled an illicit industry embedded within his regime: the Captagon trade.\n\nSince the late 2010s, Assad\u2019s regime had been involved in the production and trafficking of Captagon, an amphetamine-type stimulant. The drug trade provided Damascus with a crucial financial lifeline during the Syrian civil war, undermining the effects of international sanctions. The regime orchestrated the trade through its security agencies and branches, including the Fourth Armored Division and Air Force Intelligence Directorate, as well as via Assad family members and elite business associates.\n\nWith backing from the commercial, security, and political sectors, the Captagon trade flourished. Regime cronies in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and industry helped manufacture, package, and conceal pills with licit goods, while security agencies facilitated transport and immunity from law enforcement. Meanwhile, ministerial officials maintained a strict counternarcotics narrative, denying the presence of Captagon production in regime-held territories.\n\nBy the early 2020s, the Captagon trade had become a $10 billion industry, and the regime used the drug as a political bargaining tool. By flooding conservative markets in the Gulf with Captagon and provoking clashes along Syria\u2019s borders with Jordan, the Assad regime sought to pressure its regional neighbors into normalization talks and sanctions relief.\n\nThis tactic was most evident in the spring and summer of 2023, when Captagon became a key agenda item in normalization negotiations between the Assad regime and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other regional counterparts. The regime leveraged the threat of flooding its neighbors\u2019 borders with illicit drugs and engaging in kinetic smuggling incidents with border guards to resist demands related to human rights abuses, Syria\u2019s relationship with Iran, and regional relations more broadly.\n\nThough Syria gained reentry into the Arab League, this strategy failed, and Syria\u2019s neighbors largely refrained from intervening on the Assad regime\u2019s behalf as opposition forces dismantled the regime.\n\nOpposition forces and local communities are now beginning to uncover evidence of the regime\u2019s extensive involvement in the Captagon trade. They have searched palaces, villas, prisons, detention facilities, military bases, and even luxury car garages tied to Assad and his cronies, finding enormous caches of Captagon pills and manufacturing equipment.\n\nAt the Mezzeh air base\u2014a facility often used by the Assad family, the Republican Guard, and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate\u2014HTS forces discovered and destroyed millions of Captagon pills. In Latakia, residents raided a car-trading company\u2014owned and operated by Munther al-Assad, a prominent member of the Assad family\u2014and found thousands of pills that were soon strewn across streets and sewers. And in Douma, local residents and HTS forces identified one of the largest Captagon production sites: a former potato chip factory affiliated with Assad\u2019s brother, Maher, and the regime-allied businessman Amer Khiti.\n\nOn Dec. 8, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani delivered a victory speech at the historic Umayyad Mosque, outlining his objectives for governance in Syria. He stated that Syria had become a Captagon \u201cfactory\u201d under Assad and would be \u201cpurified.\u201d His comments are indicative of HTS\u2019s stance on counternarcotics policy. Before the group expanded its control beyond Idlib, it was already focused on curbing regime-linked drug trafficking, particularly along routes to Turkey and northeast Syria, a popular corridor for trade into Iraq. HTS Captagon seizures in the early 2020s often directly implicated Damascus.\n\nAs HTS seeks to attract international support and investment, it may adopt a strategy of expose-and-dispose toward the Captagon trade in the immediate term. This includes revealing and dismantling the Assad regime\u2019s industrial-scale manufacturing centers. However, such a strategy could take months, require immense resources, and risk the political goodwill with local communities that the new government needs.\n\nHTS will also need to demonstrate its long-term commitment to combating Captagon networks. The group might not fully eradicate smaller-scale Captagon laboratories or prevent former regime officials who may receive amnesty from continuing their operations during or after a transitional process.\n\nSyria\u2019s path forward may lie in revitalizing its pharmaceutical sector. Before the war, the country was a regional leader in generic drug production. Reconstruction efforts should focus on restoring Captagon laboratories and storage sites to create jobs for displaced skilled workers and help Syria regain its position as a regional drug supplier. Redirecting the workforce and expertise previously tied to Captagon production toward legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturing must be a central counternarcotics objective for the United States and its partners in Syria.\n\nSuch a strategy, however, would partially rely upon sectoral sanctions relief, particularly with respect to sanctions imposed on Syria\u2019s pharmaceutical industry that have prevented acquisition of raw materials for licit drug production. The United States and its partners can play a role in encouraging and potentially providing material support to rebuild Syria\u2019s pharmaceutical infrastructure, production lines, and export economy.\n\nHTS lacks the interest and capacity to address the inevitable balloon effect of the Captagon drug trade\u2014the likely spillover of drug production and trafficking into countries including Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, and Lebanon. The group is concentrated on managing Syria\u2019s transitional political process, maintaining control over border checkpoints, and getting support from local communities. HTS will likely have the means to target large players in the illicit drugs industry if its leaders choose to, but smaller actors will be able to exploit new gaps in enforcement.\n\nMajor geopolitical events often prompt creative and entrepreneurial criminal networks to adapt, seeking alternative trafficking routes, production hubs, and markets. Criminal actors have already established Captagon production and trafficking sites in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, and even Europe, positioning them close to consumption markets in the Gulf and beyond.\n\nThese actors are also likely to expand trade-based money laundering, which enables traffickers to conceal funds by leveraging legitimate businesses, to new production centers. Emerging Captagon hubs in Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, and the Gulf could exploit regional trade routes\u2014for example, having agricultural export figures masking both Captagon and its revenue. Free trade zones in the United Arab Emirates or Turkey may further facilitate fund transfers. Without robust international coordination and stricter financial regulations, these networks could adapt and diversify.\n\nAssad\u2019s fall means that Syria is no longer a narcostate, but it does not spell the end of the Captagon trade. Instead, it complicates it. Without production hubs in Syria, Captagon criminal agents are no longer tied down and can now stretch their operations beyond Syria to destinations unknown.",

                "text": "For the more than 6.2 million Syrian refugees around the world, this moment comes with an added layer of complexity: the decision of whether\u2014and when\u2014to return home.\n\nAfter 14 years of civil war, the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2014long considered a distant dream\u2014became the reality in a little more than a week in December as armed opposition groups launched a rapid offensive against the regime. In Damascus, Stockholm, Istanbul, Berlin, and elsewhere, demonstrators jubilantly marked the end of the Assad family\u2019s brutal rule.\n\nAfter 14 years of civil war, the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2014long considered a distant dream\u2014became the reality in a little more than a week in December as armed opposition groups launched a rapid offensive against the regime. In Damascus, Stockholm, Istanbul, Berlin, and elsewhere, demonstrators jubilantly marked the end of the Assad family\u2019s brutal rule.\n\nFor the more than 6.2 million Syrian refugees around the world, this moment comes with an added layer of complexity: the decision of whether\u2014and when\u2014to return home.\n\nDespite the profound uncertainty surrounding Syria\u2019s future, many governments in Europe and the Middle East appear to be forging ahead with plans to send refugees back. Barely a day after Assad\u2019s ouster, multiple European governments announced their decision to suspend asylum processing for Syrians, with many citing the need to reassess Syria\u2019s political and security situation.\n\nThough limited pauses are reasonable to ensure that asylum decisions account for new geopolitical developments, some European governments have made clear that they ultimately seek to repatriate Syrian refugees. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said Austria would prepare an \u201corderly return and deportation program to Syria\u201d; the government has already announced financial incentives for Syrian refugees to leave the country. In Germany, which holds elections next month, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, noted that Syrians celebrating the fall of the Assad government \u201cshould return to Syria immediately.\u201d\n\nIn the Middle East, some politicians have sought to capitalize on Assad\u2019s fall to push for the large-scale return of Syrians, building on years of public pressure and dwindling international support. In recent months, hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled Lebanon as a result of intensified Israeli shelling, and Lebanese authorities quickly moved to make reentry into Lebanon more restrictive. Within days of Assad\u2019s ouster, municipalities in Turkey offered Syrians one-way tickets to facilitate their return.\n\nPremature returns come with profound risks for refugees. In the case of Syria, these range from basic concerns about their livelihoods\u2014such as the lack of housing and infrastructure\u2014to more complex issues such as social tensions that may emerge due to still unsettled absentee property laws and ongoing violence. Rushing to send back millions of refugees amid such deep uncertainty is counterproductive to the goal of safe, voluntary, and sustainable refugee return, as well as to Syria\u2019s long-term stability.\n\nIf states want to help Syrians return safely\u2014and ensure that the new Syrian state is stable into the future\u2014they should guarantee that refugees\u2019 decisions are both voluntary and reversible.\n\nRight now, there is a profound sense of hope among Syrians who want to rebuild their country, and many will seek to return home permanently. But it is too soon to assess the scale or durability of such returns. Overstating the magnitude or popularity of refugee returns in a situation fraught with security, political, and humanitarian precarity risks fueling policies in host countries that push refugees into danger.\n\nIn the days following Assad\u2019s fall, some observers read the images of traffic along roads to Damascus and Aleppo as evidence that many Syrians in neighboring countries were rushing home. However, it quickly became clear that much of this traffic came from people who had been displaced within Syria. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than 660,000 Syrians have been newly internally displaced since early December 2024.\n\nUNHCR estimated on Jan. 2 that since Assad\u2019s ouster, approximately 115,000 Syrians had entered the country through official border crossings. That is a significant increase over previous years but still only a fraction of the total number of Syrian refugees in the world. What\u2019s more, at least some of those entering Syria are visiting family members or those checking on their former homes after years of separation; they may not intend to return for good.\n\nFor instance, of the 22,000 Syrians who entered Syria through Jordan from Dec. 8 to Dec. 25, 2024, only a little more than 3,000 were registered refugees. The majority were either transiting from third countries or held other legal status that enables them to return to Jordan; registered Syrian refugees are currently not allowed to return to Jordan if they leave. According to a UNHCR feedback survey of Syrians conducted after Dec. 8, 2024, the vast majority of Syrian refugees in neighboring countries are adopting a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to return.\n\nIn fact, some people who had remained in Syria until now may be compelled to leave the country, whether out of fear of new violence or uncertainty of what is to come. Tens of thousands of Syrians have fled in the last weeks, even as neighboring countries have tightened or maintained restrictive entry requirements. Reports of targeted attacks against symbols of religious minority groups have stoked fears of sectarian escalation, even as Syria\u2019s new government attempts to abate concerns. Additionally, ongoing fighting among nonstate armed groups across northern Syria as well as the Israeli shelling and expanded occupation of parts of southwestern Syria have created new reasons for displacement.\n\nEven if Syria\u2019s political and security situation stabilizes, the level of destruction and humanitarian need has left many Syrians hesitant to return. Ninety percent of Syrians live below the poverty line, and the state\u2019s services are hollowed out after years of war. As winter intensifies, millions of Syrians inside the country do not have warm shelters, and displaced refugees certainly won\u2019t have warm shelter to return to.\n\nIn a recent assessment in Lebanon by the International Rescue Committee, where one of us works, the vast majority of refugees interviewed did not have access to a livable dwelling inside Syria. As Amy Pope, the International Organization for Migration\u2019s director-general, recently noted, premature large-scale returns \u201ccould overwhelm already fragile infrastructure, potentially forcing families to move again.\u201d\n\nMany refugees fear that they could lose protections in their host countries if they return to Syria. UNHCR has said that it does not consider the situation in Syria to meet the requirements for cessation of Syrians\u2019 refugee status; refugees should not have their status revoked on the basis of a change in government alone. Though international law is clear that refugees need to be \u201cvoluntarily re-established\u201d for refugee status to be revoked\u2014meaning that they make a durable return rather than visiting temporarily\u2014this provision has not always been honored in practice. States such as Lebanon and Denmark have revoked or refused refugee status for Syrians who made visits home.\n\nRefugees\u2019 fears are amplified by the fact that many host governments have moved to restrict Syrians\u2019 access to asylum and accelerate return since before Assad\u2019s fall. In Lebanon and Turkey, Syrians have endured years of intensifying discrimination and deportations. In Europe, the rise of anti-immigrant parties has created an increasingly hostile political environment. Some politicians see this moment as an opportunity to escalate agendas to deport refugees\u2014regardless of security conditions within Syria.\n\nFor example, the Danish government has argued since 2019 that Damascus is safe for refugee returns\u2014a fiction laid bare in recent weeks by horrifying reports from prisons in the capital, where the body of a Syrian activist who returned to the country in 2020 was found alongside evidence of decades of detention, torture, and killing.\n\nRefugees must be given the time and information to make decisions about returning on their own. While there are many reasons to have hope for Syria\u2019s future, the security situation on the ground will not change overnight. Involuntarily deporting refugees or prematurely revoking their refugee status undermines the sustainability of refugees\u2019 returns. Research shows that forced returns and a lack of reintegration support can lead returnees to be further displaced and marginalized. Rushing to send refugees back may placate anti-immigrant voices, but it would violate refugees\u2019 rights and could create further instability in their home countries and neighboring regions.\n\nHost states must instead reaffirm the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers. Governments must also uphold international law that prohibits group-based denials of refugee status and recognize that many Syrians still face threats after Assad\u2019s ouster. Even amid efforts at reconciliation within Syria, the legacy of violence and trauma will be a barrier to many people\u2019s return.\n\nGovernments should also explicitly affirm continued protections for refugees who wish to visit Syria before deciding whether to return permanently. Such an approach could ultimately facilitate durable returns by enabling Syrians to be fully informed about the risks and local situation in their areas of origin without fearing that they might lose their refugee status. In one promising step, Turkey announced a mechanism for Syrians to take temporary trips home in the first half of 2025, allowing them to visit multiple times before deciding whether or not to return.\n\nFinally, host governments should recognize that many Syrians have become integral parts of their new societies. More than 300,000 Syrian refugees are now citizens of European Union countries, and many others hold long-term residency status. With deepening labor crises facing European governments\u2019 aging workforces, it is not necessarily prudent for them to rush to send refugees back. Syrians have also become crucial parts of the workforce in countries neighboring Syria.\n\nSyrian refugees will be central to rebuilding their country, whether by returning or providing political and economic support from the diaspora. These efforts are already underway, and international support for Syrian-led initiatives will be crucial. Yet as Syrians consider their own futures, the least that host governments can do is give them time to make difficult choices themselves.",

All the while, Russia still paid transit fees to Ukraine, even as it sought to utterly destroy the country.\n\nIt was quirk of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: For nearly three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, Kyiv continued to permit Russian gas to transit Ukraine via pipeline to reach consumers in Europe who still depended on it. From Kyiv\u2019s perspective, the goal was to sustain Western support for Ukraine\u2019s self-defense while giving Western consumers time to transition to other sources.\n\nIt was quirk of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: For nearly three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion, Kyiv continued to permit Russian gas to transit Ukraine via pipeline to reach consumers in Europe who still depended on it. From Kyiv\u2019s perspective, the goal was to sustain Western support for Ukraine\u2019s self-defense while giving Western consumers time to transition to other sources.\n\nEurope benefited from access to Russian gas, and Russia benefited from gas sales to Europe, thus funding its war effort. All the while, Russia still paid transit fees to Ukraine, even as it sought to utterly destroy the country.\n\nIn early 2024, however, Ukraine announced that it would end these Russian gas transits when the transit agreement expired, giving European consumers time to adjust while cutting off this source of Russian revenue. As of Jan. 1, 2025, these transits were indeed terminated.\n\nGiven adequate time to prepare, Western Europe successfully put in place other means of access to energy without reliance on such transits.\n\nThe Republic of Moldova, however, faces a particularly difficult challenge.\n\nFor years, Russia had provided free natural gas through the same trans-Ukrainian pipelines to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, a narrow, landlocked sliver of land with a small number of active Russian military, intelligence and special forces officers and a total population of less than 400,000. Transnistria has Slavic roots and historical ties to Moscow, but it also possesses local and economic interests of its own.\n\nThe free gas provided by Russia to Transnistria was used by the local population directly for heat and other consumption as well as to generate electricity, which was then sold to the rest of Moldova.\n\nThis arrangement generated operating revenue for the separatist administration. It also fueled an addiction to cheap, Russian-sourced energy throughout the entire country. (Russia\u2019s provision of cheap gas in this way is reminiscent of its energy policies toward Germany during the tenure of Chancellor Angela Merkel, at which time Moscow deliberately supplied cheap gas to Germany in order to cultivate a German interest in avoiding confrontation with Russia.)\n\nNow that Ukraine has shut off the transits, gas is no longer flowing from Russia to Transnistria via the Ukrainian pipelines. This means that gas must arrive in Moldova by different routes\u2014for example, through the TurkStream pipeline, or via liquified natural gas imports through the Greek port of Alexandroupolis, which would then transit through Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nIn the long term, Russian gas can be zeroed out. But in the short term, this situation gives Russia significant pressure points on Moldova as the country grapples with shortages of electricity, higher energy costs, and rolling blackouts. Public discontent is coming in the middle of winter\u2014and crucially, before parliamentary elections that are due to be held later this year.\n\nMoldova is neither financially nor structurally capable of replacing all Russian gas and Russian gas-generated electricity until 2026. As Prime Minister Recean told me in December, 2024, Moldova\u2019s new electricity interconnectors with the European Union will not be fully operational until 2026. While Russia may seek to provide gas to Moldova via another route\u2014for instance, through the TurkStream pipeline\u2014it will charge Moldova for any gas beyond Transnistria\u2019s immediate needs, thereby creating an immediate spike in the costs of electricity generation for Moldovan demand.\n\nWhether the higher costs of electricity will be passed on to consumers immediately or subsidized by the government\u2014or possibly with support from the European Union or international financial institutions\u2014is yet to be clarified. Some tariffs have already been increased, but not to market levels.\n\nFrom a sustainable economic perspective, it is only right that Moldova\u2019s electricity costs rise to market levels. But from a strategic perspective, introducing such a steep increase immediately ahead of national elections could spark public outrage against the pro-Western government, and thus help usher in a pro-Russian government in its place. At least, this is what Moscow is counting on. This is why the EU, United States, and international financial institutions must act.\n\nThe only bright spot in this series of unfolding events is the decision by the largest private energy company in Ukraine, DTEK, to import U.S. liquified natural gas to Ukraine through the Greece-Bulgaria-Romania pipeline, thus providing access for Moldova as well. (DTEK has the ability to provide gas, coal, and electricity, depending on Moldova\u2019s capacity and needs.)\n\nThis opens the door to a non-Russian source of gas for Moldova, although it will come at a higher price. Here, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in particular could step in with financing for such deals to help Moldova through this delicate transition in 2025. The objective should be to facilitate the country\u2019s transition away from Russian gas altogether without passing on all of the short-term transition costs to Moldovan households in the middle of an election year.\n\nHelping Moldova through this transition is a good example of the alignment of U.S., EU, and Ukrainian interests. Under its current pro-Western government, Moldova and Ukraine have worked together to ensure that the Russian forces in Transnistria do not open a new, western front in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nWith the closing of border stations between Transnistria and Ukraine, trade and transit were forced through mainstream Moldova. This greater isolation of Transnistria has reinforced the ties of this breakaway region with the heart of Moldova while weakening Russia\u2019s influence. If the current Moldovan government were replaced with a pro-Russian government, it could work to undermine western Ukraine using Russian bases in Transnistria.\n\nHistorically, Moldova has flip-flopped between pro-Western and pro-Russian governments. The pro-Russia sentiment, where it exists, is based on a variety of factors, including pro-Russian Moldovan oligarchs, local Slavik populations, a love-hate relationship with Romania (with which Moldova has historical and linguistic ties), and relative poverty in Moldova compared to Romania and the European Union more broadly.\n\nPro-Western President Maia Sandu, who served briefly as prime minister in 2019, was elected president in 2020. Following her election, her Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) then won national parliamentary elections in 2021 and has since formed a stable government. Sandu won reelection in October 2024, and a simultaneous referendum cemented the country\u2019s aspirations to join the European Union.\n\nBut even this election victory was tenuous. A majority of voters living inside Moldova voted for her pro-Russian opponent: it was diaspora voters in Europe and the United States who gave Sandu the votes needed to win overall.\n\nLooking ahead to Moldova\u2019s parliamentary elections, expected by September 2025, Russia is actively funding a handful of political parties that aim to topple Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government. These include a socialist party tied to Sandu\u2019s predecessor as president, Igor Dodon, as well as other parties backed by Moscow through exiled Moldovan oligarch Daniel Shor. Both are mounting an aggressive challenge to the PAS government, and energy disruptions and spiking prices could easily play into their hands.\n\nMoscow is calculating that the economic hardships of high electricity prices and rolling blackouts will cause voters to blame Sandu and Prime Minister Dorin Recean, shifting votes instead to parties that are perceived as being capable of cutting a deal with Russia.\n\nIf this strategy succeeds, Moscow\u2019s proxies in Moldova could gain a majority in parliament, and Moldova could flip from being an ally of the West and Ukraine in defending against Russian aggression to an entity doing Russia\u2019s bidding right on Ukraine\u2019s western border. This would be a disaster not only for Moldova, but for Ukraine as well.\n\nRegardless of the mechanisms used, the West and Ukraine together have a vital interest in assisting Moldova through this energy transition with minimal political cost for the Moldovan government. In the short term, the cutoff of free Russian gas is a crisis that Russia seeks to exploit. In the medium to long term, however, the cutoff and its replacement with Western sources is an opportunity: not just to diminish Russian influence over the country, but also to reunite the economic and political interests of Transnistria and the rest of Moldova, and to facilitate Moldova\u2019s entry into the European Union and NATO.\n\nTo favor such a positive turn of events, the United States and EU should move quickly to accelerate the building of alternative gas and electricity links to Moldova, to provide financing that allows Moldova to phase in higher consumer energy prices more slowly, and to work with private sector actors who have the immediate means to address Moldova\u2019s energy needs. All three must come together in a coherent strategy that will advance the West\u2019s overall strategic interests for years to come.",

                "title": "Why Are Western Companies Still Financing Putin\u2019s War?",
                "text": "My publisher had the right to sell my book to its Russian partner. My book contract allowed it, and most business in Russia by Western companies does not breach sanctions. However, what is legal may not be morally or economically sound. Western firms that continue to do business in Russia help Moscow finance the war in Ukraine through their payments of Russian corporate taxes. This is not even a sound investment: Nearly three years into the war, Western firms cannot repatriate the profits they earn in Russia, and the assets they own on Russian soil are not really theirs anymore.\n\nIn February 2024, Columbia University Press informed me that it had sold the rights to my book on sanctions to a Russian firm that would translate it and sell it in Russia. I replied that I did not want sales of my book to support the Kremlin\u2019s war machine, and my publisher agreed to cancel the contract. Last month, just before Christmas, I was stunned to see that a translated version of my book was a popular read in Russia.

My book contract allowed it, and most business in Russia by Western companies does not breach sanctions. However, what is legal may not be morally or economically sound. Western firms that continue to do business in Russia help Moscow finance the war in Ukraine through their payments of Russian corporate taxes. This is not even a sound investment: Nearly three years into the war, Western firms cannot repatriate the profits they earn in Russia, and the assets they own on Russian soil are not really theirs anymore.\n\nWestern firms\u2019 continued business in Russia is not a marginal phenomenon. Data compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukrainian volunteers show that, as of 2023, around 800 multinational companies from Western and like-minded countries were still operating in Russia\u2014either because they decided to stay or because they were still generating revenues there despite having pledged to leave. Combing through the data, two facts stand out. First, around 60 percent of those global firms that operated in Russia before the full-scale invasion began in February 2022 still continue to do so. Second, Germany, the United States, and France are\u2014by far\u2014the top three countries of origin for Western firms that retain a presence in Russia, accounting for around half of them.\n\nBrowsing through statements by Western firms explaining why they have decided to stay in Russia yields intriguing surprises: Many argue that their decision hinges on humanitarian reasons, either because they produce critical goods (like food) or because they feel responsible for the well-being of their staff and their families. Both arguments are easy to debunk. Russia is self-sufficient when it comes to food; in fact, it is a major exporter of many staples. What\u2019s more, Western sanctions do not target Russia\u2019s access to humanitarian goods like food, so an in-country presence isn\u2019t required. The talking point about staff does not stand up to scrutiny, either. Russia has a massive labor shortage, with unemployment at record lows and alternative jobs more than plentiful.\n\nWhat is undeniably true is that the hundreds of Western firms staying in Russia are helping Moscow finance the war in Ukraine. The data is eye-popping. In 2022 and 2023, firms from the G-7, European Union, and like-minded economies generated around $370 billion in revenues on Russian soil, which was more than Moscow\u2019s military budget over the same period. In the first two years of the war, Western firms transferred more than $11 billion in corporate taxes to Russian state coffers, with Austrian bank Raiffeisen alone accounting for one-tenth of this amount. The data is not available yet for 2024, but a ballpark estimate suggests that Western firms probably paid another $4-6 billion in corporate taxes, bringing the total to roughly $16 billion funneled to the Kremlin since the invasion began.\n\nTwo data points help put this figure into context. First, $16 billion is enough for Moscow to pay for around 5,300 Iskander missiles, 1,100 Kinzhal ballistic missiles, or 320,000 Shahed drones. For comparison, Russia\u2019s massive attack against Ukraine last Christmas used 78 missiles of various types in addition to 106 Shahed drones and decoys. Second, the amount Western firms have paid in Russian corporate taxes since the start of the war is roughly equivalent to Germany\u2019s entire military, humanitarian, and financial support to Ukraine over the same period. But money is not the only measure. For Moscow, the presence of Western firms has substantial propaganda value, as it supports the Kremlin\u2019s talking point that the Russian market is too important for Western firms to abandon.\n\nIt is clear that the moral argument convinced only a minority of Western firms to make a clean exit from Russia. At the start of the conflict, most Western firms prioritized the economic argument over the moral one, with revenues from Russia seen as too important or Moscow\u2019s conditions for asset sales too unfavorable. Many Western businesses were also betting that if they could weather the war, then they would be in a better position than their competitors once sanctions are dropped and Russia reopens. This bet was a losing one for Western firms, as the Kremlin now controls their revenues and assets.\n\nTake revenues first. Only a few weeks into the invasion in 2022, the Kremlin outlawed transferring dividends to headquarters in \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d a category that includes the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom. The ban has been relaxed a bit since then, but conditions remain stringent; the transfers cannot exceed 50 percent of the profits of Western firms in Russia. Conditions are so harsh that even firms from \u201cfriendly countries\u201d face headaches: Indian oil firm PSU, for instance, has no idea if it will ever be able to repatriate around $900 million in profits from its Russian operations. Things could soon get worse. With growing signs of strain in the economy, Moscow could well decide to impose full-blown capital controls.\n\nWith the Kremlin controlling access to their revenues in Russia, many Western firms initially assumed that a wait-and-see approach was the best option. In hindsight, this strategy was a losing one. In August 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree ensuring that Western companies could not sell their Russian assets without government approval; those operating in energy or finance would even need permission from Putin himself. One year later, the Kremlin nationalized the Russian assets of French food maker Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg, with both firms losing all but a fraction of their assets\u2019 value. With Moscow\u2019s finances increasingly in the red, things took another turn for the worse in October 2024. A presidential decree mandated that Western firms exiting Russia could only recoup a quarter of their assets\u2019 value at most: The Kremlin requires companies from \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d to discount the selling price of their assets by at least 60 percent, in addition to a 35 percent \u201cvoluntary contribution\u201d to Russian state coffers.\n\nIn Russia, Western companies are running businesses that are not really theirs anymore. If the moral motivation was not compelling enough, the economic argument to leave Russia is now watertight. On my side, the Russian publisher of my book eventually agreed to stop selling it, although I have no way to check if it\u2019s keeping its promise. Russian readers might be interested to learn that their purchase of my book serves a great cause, though. I have long given proceeds from worldwide sales to charities\u2014initially the French Pi\u00e8ces Jaunes, which finances projects for hospitalized children. I have now switched to donating royalties to the Ukrainian government\u2019s appeal to finance drones and robots for its military and generators for electricity-deprived schools.",

                "title": "A New NATO Deal for America",
                "text": "The charter, which was formally presented to senior NATO officials in Brussels last week and is now being circulated informally to European governments and the incoming Trump team, offers a detailed prescription for how European nations might meet the incoming administration\u2019s likely expectations on defense. It proposes ways to significantly accelerate Europe\u2019s ability to execute defense plans already developed for the alliance recently by the supreme allied commander Europe. This would go a long way toward reducing NATO\u2019s current excessive dependence on the U.S. military.\n\nAs U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office again, European nations are scrambling to address his threats to withdraw support for the NATO alliance unless Europe spends significantly more on defense.

The proposed Atlantic Charter 2025 prepared under the auspices of the Alphen Group aligns with Trump\u2019s contention that European defense contributions are wholly inadequate to meet the continent\u2019s current and future needs.\n\nThe charter, which was formally presented to senior NATO officials in Brussels last week and is now being circulated informally to European governments and the incoming Trump team, offers a detailed prescription for how European nations might meet the incoming administration\u2019s likely expectations on defense. It proposes ways to significantly accelerate Europe\u2019s ability to execute defense plans already developed for the alliance recently by the supreme allied commander Europe. This would go a long way toward reducing NATO\u2019s current excessive dependence on the U.S. military.\n\nThe deal inherent in the proposed charter is that in exchange for a significant European defense buildup, the United States would continue to deploy troops in Europe at about the current level. But with this European buildup, U.S. reserve forces that were once earmarked for a conflict in Europe would be able, if necessary, to shift their attention more to Asia. If both sides of the Atlantic agree, it could represent an early win for the Trump administration while sustaining U.S. commitments to NATO.\n\nThe proposed charter addresses three converging challenges. The first is the belligerent behavior that Russia displays not only in Ukraine but increasingly toward members of the alliance. The second is the growing challenge from China, most evident in its military expansion, aggressive behavior toward its neighbors, and \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia. The third challenge is the United States\u2019 growing global defense responsibilities and justified desire to redistribute defense burdens more evenly.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the charter asks what specifically Europeans should do to create a new defense contract with the United States. The public debate has focused, superficially, on top-line numbers, such as whether European nations should spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense, which most of them now do, or some higher number. More critically, what Europeans still need is a clearer understanding of what their minimum defense capabilities need to be so that they can execute their portion of the already agreed-on defense plans for Europe.\n\nThe proposed charter answers this question in detail. At the broadest level, it assesses that to meet Europe\u2019s minimum capability requirements, the European allies on their own must by 2030 collectively provide at least half of all the capabilities designated for NATO\u2019s defense in Europe. It further suggests that this share should rise to two-thirds by 2035. Growing European defenses to meet these minimum requirements would dictate defense spending at a level well above 3 percent of GDP.\n\nWhat capabilities, specifically, will Europeans be expected to contribute and why? The proposed charter suggests the creation of two European shield corps forward-deployed in Poland and Romania, backed up by four reserve European war-fighting corps. The two shield corps, together with NATO\u2019s enhanced forward presence units and U.S. front-line support, should be strong enough to hold back any initial Russian assault on NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nThe four new reserve corps would be used to quickly transform the current Allied Reaction Force into an Allied Heavy Mobile Force, a high-end first-responder force capable of a conventional deep strike. This force would be available to immediately reinforce the two shield corps to drive back any invasion force.\n\nIn addition, Europe will need to produce more so-called enablers, such as strategic airlift, air-to-air refueling, and operational intelligence. Europe today relies much too heavily on the United States\u2019 enablers.\n\nIn exchange for this increased European level of commitment, the United States would agree to permanently station fully ready units in Europe, including the U.S. Army\u2019s V Corps, the Third Air Force, and the U.S. Navy\u2019s 6th Fleet, along with Marine Corps and special operations forces units.\n\nNew command and control mechanisms and interoperability procedures would be established to ensure smooth military operations. They would be complemented by renewed focus on so-called multidomain operations, including cyberdefense, integrated air and missile defenses, and efforts to remove impediments to military mobility.\n\nNATO\u2019s nuclear deterrence also needs to be strengthened in response to the Kremlin\u2019s continued nuclear threats and increased Russian deployment of shorter-range nuclear forces, including in Belarus. The charter recommends ways to accomplish this, including broader nuclear-sharing arrangements and greater nuclear cooperation between Britain and France. Given Russian behavior, the NATO-Russia Founding Act should be set aside for now, and its prohibitions should not inhibit these and other deterrence enhancements.\n\nGiven the economic and political problems faced by many European countries, the charter suggests a way to finance defense requirements that cannot be met by immediate increases in national defense budgets. It endorses creating a defense, security, and resilience bank, which has been under study by the NATO International Staff since 2019. The bank\u2019s loans and loan guarantees would be underwritten by the creditworthiness of NATO member nations. Loans and loan guarantees would be made to NATO members and their defense industries to implement the ambitious defense plans outlined above.\n\nThe proposals in the charter are far-reaching and expensive for Europe, where some allies are still falling short of the current 2 percent spending goal. Politics in Germany and France, Europe\u2019s two largest economies, are in turmoil. Spain and Italy fall way short of the goal. European GDP growth averaging less than 1 percent in 2024 will make it difficult for many countries to increase defense spending without deep cuts elsewhere. But the combination of Trump\u2019s verbal threats, Russia\u2019s continuing aggression, China\u2019s military buildup, and the prospect of a new bank to help with financing all provide reasons to believe that Europe can do much better in the years to come. Prospects will be even better if European publics understand exactly what defense capabilities they need to produce, and that is what the Atlantic Charter 2025 seeks to provide.\n\nFollowing the necessary trans-Atlantic negotiations once Trump is sworn in next week, the upcoming June NATO Summit in The Hague would be the right place for alliance leaders to implement the ideas contained in Atlantic Charter 2025. At the summit, European leaders could cement their bonds with the new Trump administration by committing to rapidly building their capabilities, raising their defense outlays as required to meet these goals, and creating a new defense, security, and resilience bank to help finance their efforts.",

On board was Donald Trump Jr., who was on what seemed to be a public relations trip following his father\u2019s stated desire to gain \u201cownership and control of Greenland.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has voiced his desire to own the biggest island in the world, but this time is different because he has refused to assure the world that military force won\u2019t be used. \u201cThe fact that he can\u2019t assure us that he won\u2019t use military force creates uncertainty,\u201d said Bibi Nathansen, a journalist at Greenlandic broadcaster KNR. \u201cWhat is it that he wants? Does he want more military bases here? Is he going to take Greenland by force?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rekindled interest in Greenland is the latest instance of superpower interest in the island. As Foreign Policy has previously reported, Greenland\u2019s mineral wealth, the opening of shorter polar shipping routes due to melting ice, and the area\u2019s security importance as the last barrier before North America in the event of a Russian attack have all been mentioned as reasons for its geopolitical significance. Moreover, China has tried to use Greenland to gain a foothold in the Arctic on several occasions, both with investment in potential construction of airports and mining. U.S. interest in Greenland largely has been about keeping out China, which controls most of the world\u2019s rare minerals.\n\nMost political parties on the autonomous island want to work toward total independence from Denmark. The wish for independence has roots going back decades, but it has grown stronger in the last 15 years. In recent years, there has also been growing tension about Denmark still controlling Greenlandic foreign policy, with Greenlandic politicians wanting more power to influence how geopolitics play out on their island.\n\nNow, Trump\u2019s comments have thrown local politics into turmoil\u2014a development that could strengthen the island\u2019s independence movement in its upcoming election, which are set to be held before April 6. The recent turmoil has shed light on how important Greenland is in global geopolitics and could hand the independence movement a strong campaign issue\u2014advocating for talks with Denmark about more autonomy.\n\nGreenland\u2019s prime minister, M\u00fate B. Egede, has expressed a desire to gain more control over the island\u2019s foreign policy, which would mean more independence without cutting ties to its former imperial ruler. \u201cIt could go both ways,\u201d said Kuupik Kleist, who was prime minister of Greenland from 2009 to 2013. \u201cToday, Greenlanders are aggrieved by Trump\u2019s latest comments about military and economic power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now time to take the next step for our country,\u201d Egede announced in his New Year\u2019s address. His speech could have been an opening move in the election campaign, although one analysis predicted that there could be a referendum on total independence within the next election period. However, that was before Trump mentioned military and economic might as potential leverage to gain \u201cownership\u201d of Greenland.\n\nDenmark colonized Greenland in 1721, when Hans Egede, a Danish Norwegian missionary, first stepped on the ice in Nuuk. The island remained under Danish control until World War II, when the United States occupied and defended it. When the Danes moved back in after the war, they incorporated the island further by making it a Danish county. What followed was a catastrophic period of so-called modernization. People were forced to abandon their lifestyles in small villages to take up jobs in the bigger cities. The scars of imperial times have not healed, and in recent years, a new focus has been put on Danish sins in Greenland.\n\nIn 2022, Denmark apologized and provided compensation to six Greenlanders, who were the last surviving among 22 kids taken away from their families and sent to Denmark for boarding school as part of a 1950s modernization experiment. Last December, Egede commented on yet another scandal from the 1960s and \u201970s, in which Greenlandic girls as young as 13 years old had IUDs inserted without their consent, ostensibly to control population growth. He called it a \u201cgenocide.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the shadows of imperialism still dominate Greenlandic policy, the island is not a colony or county of Denmark anymore. In 1979, Greenland gained home rule, and in 2009 it signed the Self-Government Act. Today, Denmark still controls security and foreign policy, while most internal affairs, including policy about the mining rights for rare minerals, in which Trump (and perhaps Elon Musk) has an interest, is under full Greenlandic control.\n\nGreenland\u2019s economy still depends on an annual financial support grant from Denmark, which amounts to around $500 million annually (around 20 percent of the island\u2019s GDP). Some see mining as a way to become more economically independent, with one of the companies that wants to mine optimistically claiming that Greenland would get 1.5 billion Danish kroner (around $206 million) a year. However, there is a catch: If Greenland earns more than 75 million Danish kroner (around $10 million), the grant will be reduced. \u201cIf there is anything I could change with the self-government agreement, it would be that,\u201d said Kleist, who became a consultant for one of the big mining projects in the country after leaving politics. \u201cAll the income should go to Greenland without offset in the Danish financial support.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming election \u201cshould be a wake-up call for the Danish government that if they want to preserve the union with the Faroe Islands and Greenland, they have to make a greater effort,\u201d Kleist said. Maria Ackr\u00e9n, professor at the University of Greenland, said that Trump\u2019s comments could have sparked long-needed negotiations on Greenland\u2019s relationship with the Danish Kingdom . \u201cWhat has been discussed is \u2026 free association or some sort of commonwealth or looser union with Denmark,\u201d she said, adding that any new relationship would have to be approved by Greenlanders in a referendum.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments could also create a new kind of unity between Denmark and Greenland, if the government manages to negotiate more independence, which seems likely. \u201cDanish and Greenlandic politicians all agree that Greenland is not for sale. That they agree that Greenlanders are not a commodity that can be sold, but a people,\u201d said Nathansen. .\n\nOne recurring theme in the reaction to Trump\u2019s statements has been shock\u2014particularly at the comments that he wanted control over the island\u2019s security. Denmark is one of Washington\u2019s closest allies, and while Denmark resumed governing the island after World War II, the United States kept a military base there that is still active today. \u201cThe United States can already do whatever they want in Greenland militarily,\u201d Kleist said.\n\nRasmus G. Bertelsen, a professor of international relations in Tromso, Norway, agreed. \u201cIn the last 10-15 years, the United States has pressured Denmark to pressure Greenland to exclude Chinese investment,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then you can ask yourself: In order to make sure that there\u2019s no Chinese investment, science, or technology in Greenland, does the United States need to take over Greenland?\u201d\n\nThe answer is obvious. On several occasions, Chinese investors were ready to open up for business in Greenland, but Denmark prevented it. When Greenland decided to start construction on two airports, including the one in Nuuk, Americans and Danes voiced concern that a Chinese construction firm was preapproved for the work on the critical infrastructure. The result was that the Danish prime minister at the time, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, and Kim Kielsen, then prime minister of Greenland, decided to explore Danish funding. In the end, the Danish government provided part of the funding for the airport to prevent Chinese investment.\n\n\u201cWe in Europe have created, in my view, a very misleading narrative that the United States has been altruistic and benevolent to Europe,\u201d Bertelsen explained. Trump might be more honest about Washington\u2019s motives. \u201cNow it\u2019s just going to go for a transactional version, where there is no pretense of benevolence, there\u2019s no pretense of being altruistic, there\u2019s no pretense of providing global public goods.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump Force One returned to Florida, Trump Jr. was equipped with PR videos of Greenlanders in MAGA caps, telling Americans they were ready to be bought. One of the other passengers, conservative policy influencer Charlie Kirk, produced a nine-minute video about why Greenland should become \u201cstate 51.\u201d\n\nHe talked about how rich Greenland could be with all the \u201crubies the size of baseballs\u201d in the northern part of the island and all the other minerals in the ground just waiting to be taken up. \u201cAmerica should want those resources for our country,\u201d Kirk said in the video and explained how the \u201csocialist Greta Thunberg environmentalists from Copenhagen\u201d couldn\u2019t make the mining happen. In addition to the ridiculous statement that Denmark, which was ranked as the second-simplest place in the world to do business in the Global Business Complexity Index in 2023, is socialist, Kirk missed one key point: Greenlanders alone decided not to mine for rare minerals because of the fear of radioactive waste. Greenland\u2019s last national election effectively became a referendum on the mines in the southern part of the island, and Greenlanders voted for the party that promised to halt the mining projects for environmental reasons\u2014and has done so.\n\nTrump may be on people\u2019s minds when they go to the polls in the coming months. Recently, one of Greenland\u2019s two representatives in the Danish Parliament, Aki-Mathilda Hoegh-Dam, called for Greenland to become an independent state. And when the Danish and Greenlandic leaders met with the press on Jan. 10, the message from Egede was clear. \u201cGreenlanders don\u2019t want to be Danish, and they don\u2019t want to be American. They want to be Greenlandic,\u201d he said.",

                "text": "Some five months after the United States swore off imports of Russian enriched uranium, a key source of fuel for the nuclear reactors that provide almost 20 percent of the country's electricity, U.S. reliance on imports, including from Russia , remains an issue. At stake is less the fuel supply for the current fleet of nuclear reactors than the fuel for the coming generation of advanced nuclear plants that are meant to provide all the extra power needed to run data centers and power artificial intelligence; Russia has a complete monopoly on the commercial production of that richer blend of fuel.

At stake is less the fuel supply for the current fleet of nuclear reactors than the fuel for the coming generation of advanced nuclear plants that are meant to provide all the extra power needed to run data centers and power artificial intelligence; Russia has a complete monopoly on the commercial production of that richer blend of fuel. (Tech companies are so eager to line up new sources of power that Microsoft is re-commissioning part of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and will buy all of its output.)\n\nU.S. imports of Russian enriched uranium for reactor fuel fell by about half last year, when legislation barring Russian products was passed in the spring and went into effect in the summer. But the use of waivers by the United States to allow continued imports of some Russian uranium for existing customers means that the country has yet to wean off Moscow entirely, even after sweeping efforts by the rest of the West to cut dependence on Russian energy supplies that help finance the Kremlin\u2019s war in Ukraine. (Even Russia seems keen to let that trade continue: Despite announcing its own ban on exports to the United States last fall, Russia promptly issued waivers of its own to allow fuel to be sent to U.S. customers.)\n\nEurope, after a buying spree in 2023 to stock up on specialized Russian fuel needed for Soviet-era reactors, also cut back its purchases of Russian uranium last year, but it is still a buyer\u2014especially France. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently released a report that noted 2025 will be a record year for nuclear power generation and the start of an era of huge nuclear growth, but it also underscored the risks of relying on countries like Russia and China for such a critical industry.\n\n\u201cHighly concentrated markets for nuclear technologies, as well as for uranium production and enrichment, represent a risk factor for the future and underscore the need for greater diversity in supply chains,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nBut sourcing nuclear fuel is not like sourcing fossil fuels: It can take years to secure government and regulatory permits that allow for the import of enriched uranium to keep reactors running. That means that even the three-year grace period included in last year\u2019s legislation to find new suppliers to replace Russia leaves little cushion.\n\n\u201cIf I were a nuclear power operator, I would be making sure I have fuel in place for two to three years from now, because that is how long it can take to go through the process,\u201d said Cindy Vestergaard, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\nThe legislative ban and the decrease in Russian imports are the beginning of U.S. efforts to come to grips with a self-inflicted energy vulnerability that came about with the end of the Cold War and the sudden availability of cheap, abundant nuclear fuel from a former geopolitical rival. This transition period means the United States will remain largely dependent on foreign sources of fuel for its reactors, a stark contrast to its virtual self-sufficiency in oil, gas, and coal.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have not fixed the problem entirely,\u201d said Rowen Price, a nuclear policy advisor at Third Way, a center-left think tank. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that we still rely on our geopolitical adversaries for uranium.\u201d\n\nAnd at the same time that Russian imports in the United States have gone down, imports of Chinese enriched uranium have increased, sparking the Biden administration to review if China is helping Russia indirectly circumvent U.S. efforts to kick its reliance on bad actors.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to be in a position where we are trading reliance on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin for [Chinese President] Xi Jinping, so it adds to the urgency\u201d of rebuilding U.S. and European enrichment capacity, Price said.\n\nAnd that, precisely, is the second part of the U.S. push, after the phased ban on Russian uranium imports. Last December, the U.S. Energy Department picked six companies to compete for up to $2.7 billion in contracts to supply both the low-enriched uranium (LEU) needed for today\u2019s fleet and the so-called high assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) needed for the next generation of advanced nuclear reactors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity [for enrichment] in the United States, there is a huge delta between the demand and the supply,\u201d said Christo Liebenberg, CEO of LIS Technologies, one of the six companies picked. LIS, unlike most enrichment firms that use traditional centrifuges to spin gaseous uranium hexafluoride into enriched uranium, is trying to perfect the use of lasers to do the same job more efficiently and at a much lower cost.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of all hands on deck. The demand is already huge today, but now there is the surge\u201d to meet the proposed tripling of the size of the U.S. nuclear fleet, he said.\n\nAnother company picked by the Energy Department for the new project is part of Urenco, the European consortium that already operates the sole U.S. enrichment facility for nuclear power plants. Experts said it should be relatively easy to keep fueling the existing nuclear fleet from stockpiles and imports from friendly nations while additional enrichment capacity is built.\n\nBut the big question remains of what solutions will emerge for HALEU, which is needed for the next generation of reactors, as well as more traditional reactors meant to be the tech industry\u2019s solution to ravenous power demands for data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nCompanies such as TerraPower and X-energy both need HALEU for their advanced reactors, which are expected to be operational by 2030 provided the fuel is available. Initially, the plan was to get the highly enriched fuel from Russia, but its war in Ukraine and the later U.S. ban has thrown the fuel question into uncertainty.\n\nConventional enrichment technologies can make HALEU if they add extra steps and build new facilities with additional security. Another issue, noted Vestergaard, is that commercializing HALEU will require an entirely new way to transport the nuclear fuel because the casks used for lower-enriched uranium can\u2019t be used for HALEU.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been a chicken-and-egg problem with HALEU: Unless and until there is a healthy and long-term demand, there has been little incentive to invest heavily to produce it. The Energy Department program aims to kickstart that production, but it is not clear if traditional centrifuge technologies or the laser enrichment technologies can provide the advanced fuel as soon as the reactors require.\n\n\u201cThe urgency on HALEU is that we are rapidly approaching the timeline for these new projects, and they need fuel, and we don\u2019t have anywhere to get that fuel yet,\u201d Price said.",

                "text": "Forty years ago, another prominent Republican who had won reelection delivered a landmark inaugural address. Ronald Reagan, a pillar of the modern conservative movement that took form in the 1970s, enjoyed a political victory lap one January morning in Washington.

The second inaugural address is normally less dramatic than the first for a two-term president, but it is no less important in outlining a vision of what the next four years might look like.\n\nForty years ago, another prominent Republican who had won reelection delivered a landmark inaugural address. Ronald Reagan, a pillar of the modern conservative movement that took form in the 1970s, enjoyed a political victory lap one January morning in Washington. The ceremony allowed him to use his time in the spotlight to affirm a distinct rightward vision of society that would continue to define Republican politics through today. As with Trump, Reagan also was forced to hold the event indoors as a result of unusually cold weather.\n\nWhether Trump can replicate Reagan\u2019s success at entrenching a governing ideology that outlasts his own time in power remains to be seen. But the 1985 speech provides an important roadmap as to how transformative leaders have used these addresses as part of their means of achieving that goal.\n\nA top-down view shows a crowd of people encircling a small stage where Reagan is sworn in. Paintings and stone details of the circular interior of the Capitol surround the crowd.\n\nOn the day of Reagan\u2019s second inauguration speech, Jan. 21, 1985, Washington, D.C. was freezing cold. The entire East Coast was experiencing a wave of bitterly frigid weather.\n\nDespite the weather, Reagan was in great spirits. After riding into office in 1981 by defeating President Jimmy Carter with a campaign that called for a conservative national agenda, a majority of voters in 1984 appeared to have confirmed their approval of his leadership and agenda. Reagan devastated former Vice President Walter Mondale, a Minnesotan who staunchly defended the New Deal and Great Society agenda\u2014even admitting in a televised debate that he would indeed raise taxes\u2014with the kind of landslide victory that no longer happens in American politics. Reagan, once dismissed as a far-right extremist not fit for national office, won reelection with a whopping 525 Electoral College votes. Mondale only won the District of Columbia and his home state. Reagan also secured 59 percent of the popular vote.\n\nThe reelection was highly significant given that Reagan\u2019s presidency had been contentious. Democrats, who never lost control of the House of Representatives, had spent four years railing against the administration for its attacks on the social safety net. They had successfully blocked his effort to reduce Social Security benefits and prevented him from dismantling any major domestic programs even as he cut taxes for the rich and deregulated industry. House Democrats had worked with grassroots activists to promote the nuclear freeze movement as an alternative to Reagan\u2019s rapid acceleration of Cold War rhetoric and his curtailment of a nuclear arms agreement. They tried to block assistance to anti-Communist forces in Central America and backed NATO\u2019s deployment of cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe.\n\nAt the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo received enthusiastic support when he rejected Reagan\u2019s claims that the entire nation was prospering under his leadership. \u201cA shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch,\u201d Cuomo proclaimed, \u201cwhere everyone seems to be doing well. But there\u2019s another city; there\u2019s another part to the shining city; the part where some people can\u2019t pay their mortgages, and most young people can\u2019t afford one; where students can\u2019t afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate.\u201d Cuomo saw a Tale of Two Cities rather than a \u201cshining city on a hill.\u201d\n\nBut in early November, Reagan\u2019s vision came out on top. Reagan worried that he would not receive the credit he deserved. As he complained following a contentious press conference, the \u201cpress is now trying to prove it wasn\u2019t a landslide, or should I say a mandate?\u201d\n\nAt the inauguration he intended to remind everyone of the meaning of his victory.\n\nReagan, who was about two weeks away from his 74th birthday, had combined drafts written by speechwriters Peggy Noonan, Ben Hart, and Tony Dolan. Noonan recounted in her memoirs feeling surprised that the text contained much less lofty rhetoric than his other speeches. Yet it was clear that Reagan, in a bipartisan mode, was determined to lay out his vision, with some specifics, while avoiding the most divisive issues of the time.\n\nBecause Jan. 20 fell on a Sunday, Chief Justice Warren Burger administered the oath in a private ceremony inside the White House. Shortly after Reagan conducted a virtual coin toss from the White House map room for Super Bowl XIX\u2014which pitted the Miami Dolphins against the San Francisco 49ers\u2014word came that the inauguration was going to be moved inside and the parade was canceled. With the icy winds that were blowing through the city, there would be a high risk for frostbite.\n\nOn Monday, Jan. 21, the ceremony was held in the U.S. Capitol rotunda that was surrounded by glistening snow covered streets. The hall was filled with about 1,000, including prominent members of Congress. This was the first indoor address since William Howard Taft did the same 76 years earlier. The next would take place in 2025.\n\nRegan raises his right hand and places the other on a book held by Nancy Reagan. Warren Burger holds up his right hand. A crowd of faces are seen behind them.\n\nThe ceremony began at 11:30 a.m. Reagan looked his usual charismatic in a navy business suit, red-white-and blue tie, and white shirt. Reading his words without a teleprompter and in a more intimate, conversational style than people were used to, Reagan exuded confidence: \u201cMy fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness. We must do what we know is right and do it with all our might.\u201d The speech unfolded into a full-throated defense of his conservative, anti-government philosophy. Presenting his vision as one that was grounded in American tradition, Reagan said, \u201cWe asked things of government that government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase.\u201d\n\nReagan recounted how, in 1980, the nation had come to understand that, after decades of Democratic rule, it was time to restore \u201cour strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society.\u201d The voters were right, he said. Following his first four years in office, he said that \u201ctax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Reagan promised that the next few years would be a period when \u201cAmericans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government\u2019s grip \u2026 when Americans courageously supported the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.\u201d After telling a story about a bond that existed between two political rivals from the founding generation\u2014John Adams and Thomas Jefferson\u2014he urged the nation to never \u201crepeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated federal establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don\u2019t believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.\u201d\n\nWhen turning to foreign policy, Reagan doubled down on the contradictory impulses of the modern right when it came to national defense. \u201cNow let me turn to a task which is the primary responsibility of national government\u2014the safety and security of our people,\u201d he said, as he reviewed their effort to reinvigorate the nation\u2019s military capacity to stand up the Soviet Union and to discuss his investment in a missile shield that he promised would \u201crender nuclear weapons obsolete.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Reagan recovered from a mistake that was in the prepared text. Someone had not fully updated his speech following the change in venue. After declaring that \u201cwe stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy,\u201d he quickly realized those words were meant to be spoken outside and nobody had revised it. Demonstrating his actor\u2019s skill, he quickly ad-libbed, \u201cOr we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn\u2019t gotten so cold.\u201d\n\nWhile there were several detailed policies discussed in his talk such as a spending freeze, it was the philosophical argument that mattered most. Whereas his 1981 address, which argued that \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,\u201d was about inspiration, this inaugural address was about legitimacy. The president was carving his ideas into the party stone even while making predictable and generic appeals to bipartisanship.\n\nAfter the ceremony came to an end, the president and first lady joined in singing the national anthem before everyone listened as the sounds of a 21-gun salute could be heard from outdoors.\n\nRepublicans praised the speech. Sen. Joe Biden, who characterized the remarks as inspiring, dismissed the president\u2019s calls for bipartisanship. That part, he said, was \u201creally a sham. Ronald Reagan is our most partisan president.\u201d\n\nWith many headline writers picking up on the sentence, \u201cmy fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness,\u201d the press gave him good marks, not the highest. Some noted that he was more subdued than in the past, perhaps a result of the setting.\n\nBut most importantly, the message was delivered. According to Hedrick Smith in the New York Times, \u201cThe sense of urgency that he conveyed in 1981 was replaced by a sense of vindication at what he had achieved.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, seen from behind, raises both fists in the air behind a glass barrier. A crowd of people is seen out of focus below\n\nIn his second inaugural address, with two terms separated by Biden\u2019s presidency, Trump will have his shot at delivering an address of legitimation, which for him is also about retribution.\n\nTo be sure, Trump\u2019s situation is much different than Reagan. Trump did not win reelection\u2014he suffered a defeat in 2020 before coming back four years later to retake power. He was involved in an effort to overturn a presidential election and defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in a polarized era when electoral landslides don\u2019t happen, and the margins of victory are always narrow.\n\nNonetheless, within the confines of our contentious and unusual era, Trump\u2014 with reason\u2014will claim that this year signaled relatively strong support within the electorate, including in areas that were solidly blue, for MAGA Republicanism. In theory, that set of principles would revolve around protectionism, deregulation and supply side economics, some sort of amalgamation of \u201cAmerica first\u201d and neo-imperialism, cultural conservatism, and conservative populism. Whether Trump could stick to such a script is uncertain. He\u2019s not Ronald Reagan and his approach to the media is more provocative reality star than Hollywood lead.\n\nThe opportunity is his, and it is the reason many Democrats are feeling defensive and concerned. The ceremony is of course just a single address, but it comes at a moment when the new Republican Party is potentially on the cusp of entrenching a new approach to governing.\n\nCorrection, Jan. 21, 2025: A previous version of this article incorrectly named the San Francisco team that played Super Bowl XIX.

The problem is that the promise was foolish and irresponsible, and she never should have made it at all. Foreign travel is a major component of her job, and her pledge to avoid it has left her open to bad faith criticism.\n\nThe U.S. constitutional order reserves critical foreign-policy responsibilities for the federal government. However, the leadership of states and localities has always had duties that require engagement with the global community. This has only become more acute as networks of global trade and social integration have become an everyday reality for U.S. municipalities.\n\nGovernors and the mayors of large cities cannot avoid international politics because their constituents depend socially, culturally, and economically upon global engagement.\n\nMy own state, Kentucky, is nearly double landlocked and about as far from an international border and global shipping lanes as possible while still being in the United States. And yet, the governor of Kentucky and the mayors of Lexington and Louisville have international responsibilities.\n\nKentucky\u2019s most important industries\u2014agriculture, bourbon, aerospace, equestrianism\u2014are deeply tied to global markets and heavily dependent on international investment and tourism. Consequently, its governors and other elected officials regularly conduct foreign travel to countries as far flung as China and India, to develop relationships with the international community and to look out for the interests of their constituents. Most people don\u2019t understand that Kentucky, deep in the American heartland, needs its own foreign policy.\n\nEven before Donald Trump, the ways in which Americans talked about foreign travel were inflected by a rump populism that prized ignorance and facilitated xenophobia. Critics are fond of implying politicians are enjoying vacations at taxpayers\u2019 expense, while the reality is foreign travel for a public official is almost invariably onerous and exhausting. Bass\u2019s much-derided trip to Ghana, for example, involved more time in the air than on the ground.\n\nAnd if landlocked Kentucky needs a foreign policy, then all the more so for LA, which is one of the most important cities on the Pacific Rim. With a population of 3.8 million, LA would be larger than some 50 members of the United Nations. Its position on the West Coast of North America makes it a hub of transit and international commerce. The major industries in LA (most notably the film industry) have become extraordinarily dependent on international market dynamics, from which films China will let into its theaters this year to copyright disputes in Europe. This feeds into the Southern Californian tourism industry, which is enormously important for the livelihoods of Angelenos. Moreover, LA\u2019s population is among the most diverse in the world, with huge Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African communities.\n\nAll the foreign trips for which Bass has received criticism are justifiable from viewpoint of LA\u2019s interests. That LA benefits from good relations with Mexico (and consequently of the personal relationships developed during Bass\u2019s visit to Mexico City for President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s inauguration) should go without saying. Her travel to Paris was necessary to facilitate LA\u2019s hosting of the 2028 Olympic Games. Her most recent trip, to Ghana, was at the request of President Joe Biden as part of a diplomatic initiative to bring a critically important African nation closer to the United States.\n\nWith modern communications technology, Bass was never out of touch with LA\u2019s decision-making apparatus. While remote leadership has its drawbacks, especially with respect to the symbolic requirements of leadership in a time of crisis, Bass was in continuous contact with her deputies and was able to monitor developments in real time. The actual consequences on the ground for her absence are negligible.\n\nThe United States is a global nation with global interests. Cities and states have international connections the health of which are critical to their functioning as social, cultural, and economic communities. Mayors and governors have every responsibility to nurture and grow these connections, and those responsibilities often require foreign travel. The media, elected officials, and especially voters need to grow up and take these responsibilities seriously, rather than using them as grist for ignorant and xenophobic political talking points.",

The vote is evidence of dealignment, not realignment: voters below $100,000 split basically down the middle.\u201d\n\nClearly, there is a blurring of once established social and political boundaries. But does this mean that we have to abandon class analysis altogether? I think not. All too often when materialist analysis is applied, it is a byword for crude simplification. What is actually called for to fulfill the promise of materialist analysis is almost painstaking attention to detail and something akin to a novelist\u2019s flair for atmosphere.\n\nAt the very least, in analyzing the U.S. political scene, we have to allow for a three-class rather than a two-class model.\n\nOn one side, you have what you might call the working class. Let\u2019s define that in terms of dependent employment\u2014working for somebody else, earning a relatively low income, and enjoying little or no control over one\u2019s work, all of which tends to go hand in hand with relatively less education.\n\nOn the other, you have what you might call the rich, the upper class, who enjoy not just higher incomes but wealth and power and the security that goes with that. In the Marxist sense, they may actually literally control the means of production\u2014a big hotel, a factory, a retail outlet, a fast food franchise.\n\nBut you can\u2019t understand the politics of the United States right now unless you acknowledge that there\u2019s a third social class, what Barbara and John Ehrenreich called the Professional-Managerial Class, or PMC, whose members are credentialed by the education system, occupy positions of authority within the economy and society at large, and exercise control\u2014directly, often\u2014over working-class Americans.\n\nYou can\u2019t understand the politics of the United States right now unless you acknowledge that there\u2019s a third social class, the Professional-Managerial Class, which exercises control over working-class Americans.\n\nThat starts at the beginning, in kindergarten or elementary school, where you have a college-educated person taking charge of working-class kids. By the time you get to elementary school and middle school, it is not just the parents but the children themselves who are making formative experiences that can shape subjectivity for life. In modern society, the PMC is everywhere, starting in the hospital where your kids are born and your parents die, from the folks who regulate what you can build in your front yard to those who run the human resources department where you work. The entire apparatus of managerialism is activated and managed by the PMC.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten this thoroughly materialistic three-part schema in place, you can more easily understand the dynamics that are in play in the confusing configuration of class forces around Trump. The stereotypical working-class Trump voter admires Trump as the bullying, freewheeling rich dude that he is, in part because he clearly scorns the PMC. The billionaire businessman and his cronies exercise the privilege of having done well by speaking their mind and doing their own thing.\n\nAbove all, what they\u2019re allowed to do is flaunt and show disrespect and scorn for the values of the professional middle class, which the rich folks can spit on and working-class people suffer from. Trump and Co. say out loud what many ordinary Americans think. They aren\u2019t afraid to say they don\u2019t share the values of the PMC, starting with the schoolteacher and the librarian all the way up to the Ivy League professor and the folks on television who want to talk about transgender rights or structural racism or climate change.\n\nThis is not anti-materialist or a refusal of materialism. It\u2019s a very specific set of resentments, deeply embedded in the everyday experience of tens of millions of working-class Americans. If you start from this point of view, is it really hard to understand why working-class men are not keen to vote for fancy, high-powered lawyers like Harris as candidates for the Democratic Party? The distaste is compounded by the fact that the fancy female lawyer treats Trump as if he\u2019s a buffoon.\n\nOne of Harris\u2019s most successful punchlines, as far as the New York Times-reading class was concerned, was the retort \u201cI\u2019m speaking now\u201d when Mike Pence tried to interrupt her during the 2020 vice presidential debate. What her supporters read as an appropriate assertion of authority scanned for others as a typical assertion of PMC authority. Is it really surprising that white women without college degrees preferred Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and then Harris by 27 and 28 percentage points, respectively?\n\nImagine you are in an average American high school and two kids throw a party. One is the state spelling bee champion on her way to a fancy college. The other is the son of a local businessman who knows how to have a good time and may also be on his way to a fancy college but certainly isn\u2019t going there on merit. Which party would you expect the less academically ambitious kids in the class to show up at? How is this even a question?\n\nThe very fact that American liberals find this obvious social geography of gender, sexuality, class, and educational merit so hard to navigate is itself deeply telling. The PMC struggles to see beyond the bounds of its own conceits, especially concerning merit and appropriate social and political order. The virtue of the norms it defends is simply obvious.\n\nOne of the reasons why we can\u2019t see this powerful three-way split is that it\u2019s very badly captured by the statistics that we have to rely on. It\u2019s really appalling how inadequate the sociological data is on U.S. elections. We have to rely on two axes to do almost all the work. One is college-educated versus non-college-educated, and the other is a crude, three-way split in income bands: below $50,000, $50,000 to $100,000, and $100,000-plus. It is telling that if you just combine those two elements, you end up with something quite informative, which is that for men without college degrees, there is a huge propensity to vote Trump among those with more than $100,000 in annual income.\n\nThis is the boy who did not thrive academically in high school but nevertheless does well in a skilled manual job or as a small-business owner. The one thing that this man knows for certain is that he succeeded despite the dominant values of the PMC.\n\nThere are also important lessons here about the politics of welfare. The liberal approach to addressing inequality in the United States has focused on redistributing the gains of economic growth through taxation and the provision of government benefits. But this often fails to consider the class politics involved in being on the receiving end of such transactions.\n\nThe liberal approach to addressing inequality in the United States has focused on redistributing the gains of economic growth. But this often fails to consider the class politics involved in being on the receiving end of such transactions.\n\nWhen people in states like West Virginia and Tennessee vote in a way that suggests they do not want to be Medicaid recipients, they should be taken seriously. In 2023, the economist J. Bradford DeLong wrote, \u201cSocial democracy\u2019s problem was that most people did not want to be passive recipients of government benefits; rather, they wanted the social power to earn (and hence to deserve) their slice of the growing pie.\u201d They instead want a strong economy in which they can earn what they deserve and so be able to stand on their feet and buy health insurance.\n\nThere is a social ideal at work here, one that traces directly to the tripartite class structure of American society. The ultimate aspiration of many of the Trump working-class voters is self-employment because self-employment gives you the means to both assert independence and break out of the constraints\u2014which are very material as well as cultural\u2014of the professional middle class and its assumptions about norms and values.\n\nA welfare system that embraces the vast majority of the population and offers a general view of uplift may be one that is precisely not centered on the state or even on government. Rather than providing material benefits in the form of redistribution, it may require focusing on improvising social standing in the first place.\n\nThis extends to the embrace by conservatives such as Oren Cass of the organized labor movement. Their support for initiatives such as sectoral bargaining is part of a push to give working-class Americans a more robust and resilient social position in the economy. But conservatives also seek to separate this reformism from the liberal values espoused by the PMC. They believe that a better material bargain that allows people to freely express whatever political opinions they want will actually unleash a popular conservatism.\n\nThis remains a fantasy, of course. Trump is most unlikely to bring about a strengthening of U.S. trade unions. But these glimpses into the conservative imagination illuminate the need for a more refined and complex understanding of the socioeconomic and cultural hierarchies at work in the 2024 election\u2014and at work in the liberalism of the PMC, our liberalism.",

The ones with the means to do so will look to exploit the president-elect\u2019s tendency to prioritize his self-interest.

The post-World War II order that managed the globe for seven decades had already begun to fray before Trump\u2019s first term. Countries that aspired to abide by an equal, rules-based international system have watched as Washington has resisted sharing power in multilateral bodies such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. China\u2019s unprecedented rise, along with a growing global disillusionment with free trade and globalization, has turned the United States toward protectionism and made it less likely to privilege norms and professed values when they conflict with interests. This trend was already underway, perhaps most visibly since the start of the Iraq War two decades ago. Trump\u2019s return will only accelerate a move toward a more transactional global system.\n\nThe world will navigate Trump\u2019s zero-sum mindset in a variety of ways. For countries that have historically relied on Washington\u2019s friendship, the next years will bring painful disruptions. At a campaign event last February, Trump recounted how he told an unidentified NATO member he would encourage aggressors to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d if that country hadn\u2019t allocated what he deemed to be the right amount of defense spending. \u201cYou gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills,\u201d Trump concluded. The president-elect\u2019s supporters argue that he is right-sizing U.S. policy and that his maximalist statements are designed to reach desirable outcomes in negotiations. Critics counter that the mere suggestion he won\u2019t abide by a treaty alliance destroys U.S. credibility.\n\nEither way, Europe must respond to a changing relationship with the United States. Beyond encouraging European armies to beef up their militaries, Brussels is already preparing to buy American to make Trump feel as though he\u2019s winning. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde affirmed this plan by suggesting that Europe should employ a \u201ccheque-book strategy,\u201d in which it increases purchases of U.S. exports. Similarly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed giving U.S. firms special access to the country\u2019s rare minerals to appeal to Trump\u2019s quid pro quo mentality.\n\nThe larger the economy, the more touchpoints for give-and-take.\n\nWhile countries in Europe are making the best of the circumstances presented to them, there\u2019s little doubt they\u2019d rather deal with a different president in the White House. According to a poll of 30 countries and territories conducted by the Economist in July and August, resounding pluralities in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain preferred a Democratic winner over a Republican one. And it\u2019s not just Europe. Respondents from two other countries that have signed U.S. defense treaties\u2014Japan and South Korea\u2014also marked a preference for a candidate other than Trump.\n\nIn contrast, a plurality of respondents from emerging markets such as Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Vietnam expressed a preference for a Republican candidate over a Democratic one. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising. First, none of them have defense agreements that Trump could threaten to abandon. And second, while these countries acknowledge the risks under a Trump presidency, they also see abundant opportunities. Many of these rising economies have grown tired of Western lectures on human rights and democracy and are instead itching to deploy their growing clout to strike the best deals for themselves.\n\n\u201cRepublicans place more importance on a convergence of interests than coalescing values,\u201d said Syed Akbaruddin, a former Indian diplomat who served as New Delhi\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cAs a neo-realist power, India feels it can deal with a transactional Trump. If it\u2019s a question of give-and-take, we know we can give some and take some.\u201d\n\nThe larger the economy, the more touchpoints for give-and-take. One element of Trump\u2019s style that seems to lend itself to transactions is his inclination to pick family members in official roles. Daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner played significant roles in domestic and foreign policy in Trump\u2019s first term. Trump has now named Jared\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, as his ambassador to France and Massad Boulos, father-in-law to Tiffany Trump, as his Middle East advisor.\n\nThere\u2019s a track record of countries reaching out to family members to draw closer to Trump himself. Six months after leaving the White House, Jared Kushner\u2019s private equity firm received a $2 billion investment from a Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by the country\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The seed money was approved despite objections from the fund\u2019s due diligence committee, according to documents seen by the New York Times. One way of interpreting the decision is as an investment in a member of the future U.S. president\u2019s inner circle.\n\nIndia tried a different approach during Trump\u2019s first term as it scrambled to get on an inside track. In November 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out a red carpet to welcome Ivanka Trump to Hyderabad for a business summit focused on empowering women. No expense was spared: Roads were repaired, pavements cleaned up, and curbsides painted as the city put on a charm offensive for the president\u2019s daughter, with adoring TV reports on the country\u2019s government-friendly cable channels. The entire operation was designed to catch the transactional Trump\u2019s eye, a leader known to enjoy not only pomp and circumstance but also favorable media coverage.\n\nAn illustration shows Donald Trump sitting on one end of a seesaw with the globe as the fulcrum.\n\nIf U.S. allies and emerging markets have a relatively clear strategy to appeal to the opportunistic part of Trump world\u2014flattery, deals, buying American, and leveraging family connections\u2014it is less obvious how U.S. adversaries might fare. Rivals such as Russia and China, already sanctioned and sidelined by the United States, are bracing for tougher penalties while simultaneously relishing the prospect of a more unstable global order. Russia sees NATO\u2019s strength\u2014backstopped by the United States, of course\u2014as a mortal, long-term threat. China, meanwhile, has complained of Washington\u2019s desire to create an \u201cAsian NATO\u201d in the form of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a group that also includes Australia, India, and Japan. If Trump denigrates either alliance to reach better deals in one domain, then U.S. adversaries will gain in another. Similarly, if the success of U.S. attempts to curb Chinese development of high-level semiconductors hinges on cooperation with U.S. allies, then Beijing would welcome any disruption in those partnerships.\n\nTariffs are likely to play an outsized role in Trump\u2019s negotiating tactics; he has already deployed them in the past as a tool to bludgeon China and has more recently described \u201ctariff\u201d as \u201cthe most beautiful word in the dictionary.\u201d What is unclear is how they will serve U.S. interests. In the short term, tariffs function mostly as a sales tax, with immediate inflationary impacts that are likely to affect lower-income families more acutely than richer ones. Economists linked to Trump argue that over time, tariffs could raise immense amounts of revenue, funding tax cuts and encouraging businesses to produce locally, thereby correcting some of the key problems they diagnose in the U.S. economy. Even if those assessments have merit, they are inherently longer-\n\nterm projects. Yet, in the short term, tariffs are likely to cause two things Trump loathes: inflation, as mentioned, but also panic in the stock market. Paradoxically, Trump\u2019s favorite tactic is likely to be the one he may not have the patience to see through. And by all accounts, Beijing has a sophisticated understanding of this dynamic and is therefore unlikely to react passively to tariffs designed to damage its economy. If China can contribute to a stock market downturn, it likely will, knowing how much Trump will dislike it. And while Beijing has reduced its exports to the United States, it retains significant leverage over key U.S. companies such as Apple and Tesla, which continue to run large manufacturing operations in China.\n\nCountries from the Maldives to Mauritania lack the size, strength, or salience to lobby for preferential treatment in the event of blanket global tariffs.\n\nSpare a thought for a final group of countries that stands to lose the most in the likely scenario where Trump shuns multilateralism and prioritizes bilateral transactions: the more than 100 nations with populations under 10 million. Countries from the Maldives to Mauritania lack the size, strength, or salience to lobby for preferential treatment in the event of blanket global tariffs or the Trump team\u2019s search for favorable deals on the global stage. A majority of these countries are developing economies spread out across the global south, generally flying under the radar of great-power politics.\n\n\u201cSmaller countries\u2014by their very definition\u2014would like a world with more rules. They don\u2019t have the leverage larger countries have,\u201d said Akbaruddin, the former Indian diplomat. And in many ways, smaller and lower-income countries have never needed more leverage. After the peak years of free trade and globalization in the latter part of the 20th century, and the China-led commodities boom at the start of the current century, there is no longer a rising tide lifting all boats. Instead, there\u2019s the existential threat of climate change, which smaller countries do not have the funds to build defenses for; a world that has become more protectionist, prioritizing large-scale industrial policy and domestic production, and in which smaller countries lose out; and growing global conflict, leading to mass migration and instability in the food and commodities markets, which tend to generate the biggest disruptions for the tiniest nations. In each of these cases, a more transactional global order re-creates the scenario Thucydides once described: The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer as they must. If the law of the jungle dominates statecraft, where does that leave the art of diplomacy?\n\nThe Biden years now represent a blip in the longer trend line of Trump\u2019s America First. It\u2019s worth noting that President Joe Biden himself frequently struggled to mask the contradictions between his rhetoric and his actions. Two weeks after assuming the presidency in 2021, Biden declared at the State Department that \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d His words were designed to reassure the global community that Trump\u2019s first term was an aberration. \u201cDiplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy,\u201d he said.\n\nYet while he was fond of promising that his White House would defend freedom and uphold universal rights, Biden found himself in the awkward position of visiting Jeddah in the summer of 2022 and fist-bumping Mohammed bin Salman, whom he once branded a \u201cpariah\u201d for his role in the murder of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi. Riyadh\u2019s muscle in the oil markets turned out to be more valuable than Biden\u2019s idealism. More recently, Biden\u2019s seemingly blind support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza\u2014a lonely stance in the very multilateral organizations the United States helped create\u2014furthered a global sentiment that Washington had one set of rules for friends and another for everyone else.\n\nBiden was also not immune from nepotism. After repeatedly denying he would pardon his son Hunter for his three felony convictions, Biden did just that after his final family Thanksgiving dinner as president. Once again, Biden\u2019s lofty words had come back to bite him.\n\nTrump won\u2019t have these kinds of problems. Global expectations of him are lower to begin with. Having won a popular vote while making clear he will put America first\u2014at all costs and unconstrained by concerns about human rights, values, the climate crisis, or migration\u2014Trump will assume he has a free pass to pursue what he sees as being in Washington\u2019s brazen interest. For much of the rest of the world, this won\u2019t feel like a massive course correction. Instead, it\u2019ll confirm a collective instinct that the old world order is no longer fit for purpose.",

                "text": "The central elements of that aspiration were a \u201c foreign policy for the middle class \u201d (meaning, industrial policy, restricted trade, and expansive government spending), weighting diplomacy over military force, and deepening and expanding alliances. The policy explicitly connected democracy at home and abroad.

In a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote that the administration was able to successfully enact \u201ca strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad.\u201d\n\nThe standards that the Biden administration set for itself are one way by which to measure the success or failure of its policies. And by the Biden team\u2019s own criteria, its foreign policies have not met its grandiose standards. The middle class appeared more concerned about inflation than democracy at home or America being back abroad; near the end of Biden\u2019s presidency, two-thirds of U.S. voters considered the country on the wrong track. And rather than strengthening democracy at home, the Biden administration has become the bridge between the first and second Trump presidencies.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021 depressed President Joe Biden\u2019s approval, and from there it never recovered. Even though then-President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 deal with the Taliban set the disaster in motion, Biden\u2019s refusal to acknowledge any responsibility for the outcome or error in execution, and its amplification by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, justifiably called into question the competence of a team that took pride in and marketed itself as a safe pair of hands after the squalid upheaval of the Trump administration.\n\nBut even before the Afghanistan debacle, Biden demonstrated indifference to the foreign-policy consequences of his glib public pronouncements. He called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201ckiller\u201d and threatened to make Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a \u201cpariah.\u201d While those sentiments were admirable, they weren\u2019t matched by policies and instead wilted when those leaders imposed consequences on the United States. Such utterances are of a piece with the president declaring at least four times that the United States would send troops to defend Taiwan: The policy isn\u2019t the problem, but the disconnect between the statement and procuring the military force to achieve it, and the lack of a campaign of public education to prepare Americans for a war against China, is. Given the precedent of obsequious capitulation\u2014as when Biden officials discovered that Saudi Arabia was actually important to U.S. objectives in the Middle East, could affect the U.S. economy, and had the option of cooperation with China\u2014the likeliest Biden reaction to China calling his bluff would have been a failure to carry out his stated policy.\n\nThis is the central failure of Biden\u2019s foreign policy: the expansive chasm between brave pronouncements and what the administration was actually willing to risk or commit to achieve its goals. In theory, Biden\u2019s policy toward Iran was that unless Tehran forswore developing nuclear weapons and committed to a longer and stronger nuclear deal, the United States would destroy the country\u2019s nuclear infrastructure. Yet it is impossible to imagine a president so committed to reducing U.S. involvement in the Middle East, and broadly skeptical about the use of military force, carrying out that policy.\n\nThis is the central failure of Biden\u2019s foreign policy: the expansive chasm between brave pronouncements and what the administration was actually willing to risk or commit to achieve its goals.\n\nNowhere is the gap between objective and risk more evident or damaging than Ukraine. Biden officials repeatedly said the United States would support Ukraine \u201cas long as it takes,\u201d committing more than $100 billion in assistance, but they provided that assistance more slowly than needed, without consideration of the costs in blood and momentum from their fear of escalation. Their hesitance to commit to Ukraine regaining its internationally recognized territory even produced the unusual circumstance of America\u2019s European allies initiating transfers of weapons that Washington had hesitated on providing. Only then was the Biden administration reluctantly shamed into matching the courage of smaller, more at-risk allies.\n\nThe administration wasn\u2019t wrong to be cautious early in the Russian invasion; its fearfulness of a regional war becoming a world war was justified. But its approach to telegraphing that fearfulness emboldened Moscow and other adversaries to adopt strategies that threatened escalation, as Russia did recently in amending its nuclear doctrine when the United States finally allowed Ukraine to employ ATACMS missiles against targets inside Russia. And despite numerous Russian threats and red lines as Western support expanded, the war has not widened beyond Ukraine or escalated to nuclear weapons use. That suggests a greater appreciation in Moscow than in Washington of the fundamental power equation favoring the United States and its allies. Yet the Biden administration remained overly cautious to such an extent that it has not only prevented Ukraine\u2019s success but also reduced U.S. support for continuing to aid Ukraine.\n\nThe Biden administration also averted its eyes from mushrooming problems such as the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs. In early 2020, Iran\u2019s breakout time was a year; it\u2019s now likely one to two weeks. In 2021, experts estimated that North Korea had assembled between 10 and 20 nuclear warheads; it now has roughly 50, with fissile material for 70-90 more. Biden\u2019s team didn\u2019t appear to have a North Korea policy until 2023; North Korea didn\u2019t even merit a subtitle in the National Security Strategy, as food insecurity and climate and energy security did. Instead, there was just a passing reference to the threat of the North Korean nuclear and missile programs. The Biden administration simply ignored the provocations of an expanded nuclear weapons arsenal, repeated missile and satellite launches demonstrating improved ability to target the United States, repudiation of Korean unification by Pyongyang, and provision of artillery and other weapons to Russia.\n\nThe commitment of at least 10,000 North Korean soldiers to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine provoked such alarm among allies in both Europe and Asia that the administration finally had to respond. Biden declared Pyongyang\u2019s behavior \u201cdangerous and destabilizing\u201d and said something must be done, but he didn\u2019t do anything beyond ineffectually encouraging China to restrain North Korea and claiming that he would now belatedly allow Ukraine to begin using some U.S. weapons at their effective ranges\u2014but only in the vicinity of one part of the battle, once again telegraphing Washington\u2019s anxieties to the aggressor. Deterrence doesn\u2019t work that way. Instead of creating uncertainty and fear in its adversaries about how the United States would use its strength to prevent or penalize their malign actions, the Biden administration projected the constraints it put on U.S. behavior.\n\nAn illustration shows Joe Biden at a podium with a globe-shaped talk bubble that is partially finished with incomplete scaffolding on more than half of it. A Trump-shaped shadown looms over Biden.\n\nAnother major deficiency in the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy was the absence of meaningful trade initiatives. Allies in Asia hoped the Biden administration would rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership; what they got were belated empty vessels in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, neither of which provided market access provisions. The Biden White House privately said it would vigorously pursue bilateral and narrow sectoral trade agreements, but it didn\u2019t accomplish much. The president added insult to injury at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in November 2023 by pulling a deal already negotiated with 13 other countries.\n\nThat dearth of opportunity has been coupled with retaining Trump tariffs on allies, \u201cBuy America\u201d restrictions, and subsidies to U.S. businesses, making U.S. international economic policy regressive. What allies want is a vision for mutual prosperity without having to rely on China, and what they have gotten from the Biden administration is further restrictions on their businesses and threats of sanctions against doing business with China.\n\nTrade policy was not the only major regression in the levers of U.S. power during the Biden administration: Defense spending looms even larger. The U.S. defense budget failed to keep pace with inflation in any of the four years of his term. The U.S. military has lost ground rather than gained it in those four years. In the first year of the Biden administration, Congress on a bipartisan basis added $25 billion to the president\u2019s budget request. In the second year, Congress added $45 billion to the president\u2019s budget request. Currently, Congress is deciding between adhering to the president\u2019s budget caps (in the House of Representatives) and raising his request by between $21.5 billion (Senate Appropriations Committee) and $37.4 billion (Senate Armed Services Committee).\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has increased its defense spending to record levels, such that it will make up a third of the country\u2019s budget in 2025, and China has more than doubled its budget since 2015 (and that\u2019s just using Chinese government figures\u2014calculating China\u2019s defense spending as the United States calculates it brings it to more than $700 billion, approaching parity with U.S. spending). The Biden administration describes China as the \u201cpacing challenge,\u201d and it has allowed the country to outpace the United States on virtually every metric of defense and defense industrial capability.\n\nA humiliating retreat from Afghanistan, allowing deterrence to corrode, adopting a risk-averse approach to adversaries, persisting in an unsuccessful approach to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, trade policy missing in action, and inadequate defense spending\u2014those are all big things to get wrong in national security policy. There were lesser disappointments, too, such as the 2021 Summit for Democracy designed to \u201cbolster democratic governance at home and abroad,\u201d which exacerbated tensions with excluded allies and produced nothing.\n\nThere was also a major missed opportunity in the consolidation of North America as a labor platform, an energy production and distribution grid, and a supply and manufacturing base. If the United States and its immediate neighbors could find ways to deepen their cooperation, they would have the economy of scale to confront China, secure supply chains, and reduce immigration by both increasing standards of living in Mexico and giving the United States strategic depth to manage the flow of immigrants at Mexico\u2019s southern border. It would be an enormous lift for the three governments, but the alternative is Mexico sinking into criminality and China getting a back door into the U.S. economy and expanding its influence in Latin America. The Biden administration didn\u2019t even attempt it. In fact, one of Biden\u2019s first official acts was to cancel the U.S.-Canada Keystone XL pipeline project.\n\nThe administration\u2019s record is not just a litany of failures, however. It had very important successes. The United States didn\u2019t become involved in a major war during Biden\u2019s term, and given how dangerous the world is becoming, that is a major accomplishment. I would have preferred deterring more and conceding less to achieve it, but keeping the United States out of major wars is good for the country\u2014especially when domestic disputes loom large and are intractable.\n\nThe administration prioritized threats, with China paramount, expanding both cooperation and the tools to deal with them. It joined AUKUS, a tripartite arrangement with Australia and the United Kingdom for cooperative military development. It deepened defense cooperation with the Philippines and supported Manila\u2019s maritime claims and has started trilateral Japan-Philippines-U.S. consultations. It encouraged Japan\u2019s initiative for rapprochement with South Korea and institutionalized it with the Camp David agreements. It expanded cooperation through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan. It gained support from NATO allies for China as an alliance concern. It brought creative economic statecraft into play, with the U.S. Commerce Department taking a leading role in determining what to prohibit and how. It returned attention to neglected small states across the Pacific being intimidated or seduced by China.\n\nUnder the able leadership of Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns (with a uniformed assist from Gen. Paul Nakasone at the National Security Agency until his retirement last February), the Biden administration restored the reputation of the U.S. intelligence community, with accurate assessments, increased transparency, and expansive intelligence sharing. Not only was it right, but it was right early enough for allied governments to align their policies in advance of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It repeatedly showcased remarkable penetration of the Russian government without exposing its sources. It appears to have recovered from China\u2019s decimation of its network of agents, doubling resources and establishing a CIA mission center focused on China.\n\nIf the United States and its immediate neighbors could find ways to deepen their cooperation, they would have the economy of scale to confront China, secure supply chains, and reduce immigration.\n\nThe Biden administration has held the NATO alliance together through its greatest test since the 1956 Suez crisis. Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine could have shattered the alliance (and may yet). Instead, the Biden administration not only reassured allies but led them to a strong and unified stance on defense of the NATO area and provision of material support to Ukraine. And allies have continued to increase their defense spending, an upward trend that began with Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine: 23 allies now meet the agreed-on 2 percent of GDP committed to defense. Successful negotiation of Sweden\u2019s and Finland\u2019s accession to the alliance required painful interactions with Turkey and would have been impossible without sustained effort from the Biden administration.\n\nThe administration also organized a colossal international effort to provide military aid to Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin corralled more than 50 counterparts to meet monthly with Ukrainian officials for updates on the war and needed assistance. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a reminder of what U.S. leadership can accomplish and how much it is needed in a dangerous time.\n\nMany of these achievements are likely to be squandered by the Trump administration. Donald Trump is temperamentally ill-suited to multilateral or institutionalized cooperation, preferring personal bilateral dealings that maximize U.S. leverage and center attention on him. His record is decidedly mixed on deterring aggression, and no one knows what he will propose budgetarily. He is deeply distrustful of the intelligence community and military leadership. His cabinet appointments so far are long on wrecking balls and short on construction crews.\n\nA reflection by the great 19th-century short-story writer Washington Irving seems applicable to the recent U.S. election: \u201cThere is a certain relief in change even though it be from bad to worse! As I have found in travelling in a stage-coach, that it is often a comfort to shift one\u2019s position, and be bruised in a new place.\u201d America, and the world, is about to be bruised in a new place.",

                "text": "Trump sounded different from post-Cold War presidents, but his sentiments echoed Richard Nixon, who also liked to get mad in both meanings of the word. Indeed, according to his staffer H.R. Haldeman , Nixon coined the term \u201cmadman theory,\u201d explaining that he wanted the North Vietnamese to believe he was capable of doing anything to bring the Vietnam War to an end\u2014up to and including the use of nuclear weapons. The madman theory posits that a leader who behaves as if he could do just about anything has a better chance of persuading other global actors to make concessions they otherwise would not make.\n\nWhen Donald Trump first ran for U.S. president in 2016, he sounded mad an awful lot of the time\u2014in both senses of the word. Trump had no problem displaying anger on the campaign trail. In a 2016 Republican primary debate, he leaned into this emotion, saying he would \u201cgladly accept the mantle of anger\u201d because he believed the country was a \u201cmess\u201d and run by incompetent people. Trump also embraced the notion that he was a different kind of mad. In statement after statement, he stressed that he would be a different type of president because he was willing to be a little bit crazy, a little bit unpredictable. In 2015, he told an interviewer, quoting another businessman, \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a certain unpredictability about Trump that\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d In his first major foreign-policy speech of that campaign, he blasted U.S. foreign policy during the Barack Obama years, saying , \u201cWe must as a nation be more unpredictable.\u201d\n\nWhen Donald Trump first ran for U.S. president in 2016, he sounded mad an awful lot of the time\u2014in both senses of the word.

The madman theory posits that a leader who behaves as if he could do just about anything has a better chance of persuading other global actors to make concessions they otherwise would not make.\n\nNixon subsequently denied that the conversation ever happened, but the idea of the madman theory has an intellectual lineage that stretches back to Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. Furthermore, the scholarly literature on the theory has shifted in recent years\u2014suggesting that under certain circumstances, such a gambit might work for someone in Trump\u2019s position.\n\nCould Trump\u2019s madman theory be so crazy that it just might work?\n\nIn some instances during his first term, Trump intentionally cultivated a reputation as a madman. This was most evidently on display in his approaches to North and South Korea. For much of 2017, Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric toward North Korea, telling reporters that August, \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. \u2026 They will be met with fire, fury, and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201d In his U.N. General Assembly speech one month later, Trump nicknamed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cRocket Man\u201d and promised that the United States could \u201ctotally destroy North Korea.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s madman approach extended to South Korea. In 2017, his administration sought to renegotiate the terms of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Jonathan Swan reported in Axios that Trump explicitly ordered chief trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer to tell his South Korean counterparts that Trump was a madman: \u201cYou tell them, \u2018This guy\u2019s so crazy he could pull out any minute.\u2019 \u2026 You tell them if they don\u2019t give the concessions now, this crazy guy will pull out of the deal.\u201d Swan further noted, \u201cPlenty of world leaders think the president is crazy\u2014and he seems to view that madman reputation as an asset.\u201d\n\nTrump stopped taunting Kim in return for three meetings that generated little beyond some glossy photo-ops. The free trade agreement was successfully renegotiated, though the changes to the deal were minor. Still, acolytes of the former and future president could argue that Trump did well for the United States. For all his rantings and ravings, Trump secured modest trade concessions from South Korea and a brief pause in missile tests from North Korea\u2014all without having to carry out his seemingly crazy threats. In other words, he was sounding irrational for entirely rational reasons.\n\nThis was different from Trump\u2019s staffers and subordinates telling reporters that he was acting like a madman. That trope was prevalent enough for CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto to write a book about Trump\u2019s foreign policy titled The Madman Theory. According to Bob Woodward\u2019s Fear, White House staff secretary Rob Porter spent a third of his time talking Trump down from his impulsive ideas. Woodward himself concluded that the United States \u201cwas tethered to the words and actions of an emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader.\u201d\n\nYet the idea that by acting like a madman, a leader could profit in world politics has a longer pedigree than Nixon. In Discourses on Livy, Machiavelli suggested that \u201cat times it is a very wise thing to simulate madness.\u201d In the early years of the Cold War, strategists Daniel Ellsberg and Thomas Schelling thought about the possible virtues of cultivating a reputation for madness in coercive bargaining situations. Schelling wrote in The Strategy of Conflict that \u201cit is not a universal advantage in situations of conflict to be inalienably and manifestly rational.\u201d If others believe a madman could do just about anything if he does not get his way, the threat of escalation becomes more credible\u2014making it logical to concede more to de-escalate.\n\nThe ploy benefits leaders who are deemed mad because of their extreme preferences rather than their extreme tactics.\n\nNeither Ellsberg nor Schelling ever advocated for a U.S. president to behave in this way. In the end, neither of them thought the madman gambit would work well over the long run. And until recently, the scholarly literature on the madman theory was equally skeptical of the likelihood of success. For example, according to multiple first-person and scholarly accounts, Nixon\u2019s madman gambits yielded nothing in the way of concessions.\n\nMore recent work on this topic, however, has been less definitive. Penn State professor Roseanne McManus has written on this subject extensively. Her initial research suggested that under a narrow set of circumstances, the madman strategy could work. The gambit benefits leaders who are deemed mad because of their extreme preferences rather than their extreme tactics, as well as leaders who are deemed to be mad about a particular situation rather than madness being inherent in their character. In other words, actors who felt strongly about a particular issue, and only that issue, could use the madman gambit to some effect. In a follow-up paper, McManus concluded that the madman approach \u201cmay be helpful in crisis bargaining \u2026 when the reputation for madness is slight.\u201d This does seem to be a fair description of Trump. Other recent research argues that there can be virtues in unpredictability as a strategic doctrine.\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt that Trump will be able to effectively play the madman in his second term, however. The most obvious is that Trump\u2019s first-term efforts at coercive bargaining went largely for naught. His administration\u2019s track record on economic coercion was less than stellar. Trump\u2019s greatest foreign-policy success\u2014the Abraham Accords\u2014was due to proffering inducements rather than crazily threatening sticks.\n\nTrump\u2019s madman schtick worked better with U.S. allies than adversaries. The former group of countries, rattled by his threats to withdraw from long-standing alliances and trade treaties, at least made some public displays of fealty. Trump, however, was too busy trying to ingratiate himself with the autocratic rulers of China and Russia to act crazy in front of them. His efforts to employ the madman strategy with Iran proved mixed. He approved the drone strike that killed Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Quds Force\u2014but only after he backed down at the last minute from retaliating against Iranian attacks on Saudi Arabia. In a recent interview, Trump even suggested that he was the calm, rational one compared with National Security Advisor John Bolton.\n\nThis highlights another problem: Most foreign leaders are now intimately familiar with Trump\u2019s playbook. One reason Nixon\u2019s madman gambit failed was that Soviet officials, familiar with Nixon from his decades in public office, knew when he was pretending to play the madman. As one Soviet official explained, \u201cMr. Nixon used to exaggerate his intentions regularly.\u201d Trump\u2019s past track record has made him more predictable to a host of foreign leaders who had to deal with him the first time around. As it turns out, the first rule of the madman theory is that you do not talk about employing the madman theory. Expecting Trump to stay silent on such matters, however, is a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nWhat is worrisome is that this time around, Trump might think he can pull it off even when the rest of the world does not.\n\nFinally, as the scholarly literature has stressed, successful coercive bargaining requires two kinds of credible commitment. First, the target has to believe that the other actor will carry out their threats, no matter how costly they are. Second, the target must also believe that the threatening actor will cease and desist from any coercion once an agreement has been reached. Acting like a madman might make the first kind of commitment more plausible, but it makes the second kind of commitment less plausible. Or, to put it more plainly: What is the likelihood that any foreign-policy leader will believe Trump when he gives his word about anything? As McManus put it to me in an email, \u201cMost perceived madmen do not benefit from their madness reputations.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to reprise his madman approach to international relations is unlikely to work during his second term, but he will likely try it anyway. Trump is a man of few moves, and this is one of them. His political allies noted during his first term that Trump is rarely playing three-dimensional chess: \u201cMore often than not he\u2019s just eating the pieces.\u201d\n\nWhat is worrisome is that this time around, he might think he can pull it off even when the rest of the world does not. Trump\u2019s improbable journey from convicted felon to second-term president could convince him to take even more risks. As one Trump advisor told Politico in November, \u201cLook, he survived two assassination attempts, he\u2019s been indicted how many times\u2014he really is at this moment feeling kind of invincible and sort of emboldened in a way that he never has before.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, if Trump is unable to convince anyone else that he really is a madman, then the only way he can prove it is to follow through on his most outlandish threats. Maybe that would work, but it could also lead to a conflict spiraling out of control. Which sounds, to be perfectly honest, like a pretty crazy idea.",

                "text": "\u201cBulldozer justice\u201d first gained prominence in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, a saffron-clad Hindu monk and the state\u2019s chief minister. Since 2020, state officials under Adityanath, a member of the BJP, have regularly ordered the use of bulldozers to demolish the properties of individuals, mostly Muslims, accused of involvement in criminal activity or protests against the government. Adityanath, who is known for making inflammatory and provocative remarks against Indian Muslims, hailed the bulldozer as a tool of justice that led him to earn the sobriquet \u201c Bulldozer Baba ,\u201d or bulldozer monk.\n\nBulldozers are ubiquitous on construction sites the world over. But in India, they are also something more. Bulldozers have become a symbol, a perpetrator of a divisive and violent brand of retributive justice that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has developed since Modi first came to power in 2014 and, despite growing political and judicial resistance, continues to propagate. Used to target Muslims under the guise of governance, the bulldozer reflects India\u2019s current imbalance along religious lines.\n\nBulldozers are ubiquitous on construction sites the world over.

Since 2020, state officials under Adityanath, a member of the BJP, have regularly ordered the use of bulldozers to demolish the properties of individuals, mostly Muslims, accused of involvement in criminal activity or protests against the government. Adityanath, who is known for making inflammatory and provocative remarks against Indian Muslims, hailed the bulldozer as a tool of justice that led him to earn the sobriquet \u201cBulldozer Baba,\u201d or bulldozer monk.\n\nThe extrajudicial use of bulldozers as weapons against Muslim homes, businesses, and places of worship in the name of allegedly dispensing justice was later replicated by states such as Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan\u2014all ruled by the BJP. Modi himself endorsed Adityanath\u2019s bulldozer politics during a speech last May in Uttar Pradesh. In February 2024, Amnesty International released a report on \u201cbulldozer injustice,\u201d expressing concern over the increasing number of politically motivated punitive demolitions \u201cinstigated by senior political leaders and government officials,\u201d which had impacted at least 617 people, largely Muslims.\n\nAnd despite setbacks experienced by the BJP in last year\u2019s general elections, bulldozer justice is still being enacted against Muslims. In June, 11 houses belonging to Muslims were demolished in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Mandla district after authorities claimed that they found beef in their refrigerators. In October, authorities in Rajasthan demolished a house they said was built illegally on temple land. The actions followed allegations against the homeowner Naseeb Chaudhary and his son of involvement in a knife attack at a Hindu temple.\n\nMeanwhile, the bulldozer has become an inextricable part of India\u2019s political culture, a symbol of Hindu-nationalist political iconography. In political rallies across the country during the 2024 elections, hordes of bulldozers\u2014adorned with flowers and posters of Modi and Adityanath\u2014were on display as props.\n\nThe bulldozer is not only a political symbol; it has permeated the national culture, with bulldozers as popular toys and stylized images on snack wrappers. In the aftermath of the BJP\u2019s victory in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections, young male supporters lined up in front of tattoo studios to get bulldozers inked on their skin. Another notable example is the regular evocation of bulldozers in the lyrics of Hindutva pop, a genre of music that infuses Hindu-nationalist ideology with popular music styles and catchy beats.\n\nThe genre regularly glorifies the enforcers of bulldozer justice, presenting them as heroes and protectors of Hindu identity. Bulldozers themselves are glorified for perpetrating retributive violence. One popular song features the lyrics \u201cHe is tough on anti-nationals / Bulldozer Baba is saffron-clad.\u201d The song, released two years ago on YouTube, has some 4.2 million views.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s disappointing results in the 2024 general elections have triggered a conversation about whether the party\u2019s divisive approach to sectarian politics, as symbolized by the bulldozer, is sustainable. But the bulldozer continues to be central to Adityanath\u2019s political strategy.\n\nIn a parliamentary session last July, Uttar Pradesh state minister Sanjay Nishad, a BJP ally, attributed the party\u2019s losses to the \u201cmisuse of bulldozers.\u201d In response, Adityanath stood by the \u201cbulldozer policy,\u201d asserting that he was not motivated as chief minister by the mere desire to hold a job but \u201cto ensure that those guilty also suffer.\u201d Many BJP voters clearly support this view. On Nov. 9, 2024, several of Adityanath\u2019s supporters attended his public rally in the city of Mainpuri riding on a bulldozer. It was an obvious threat that the public should toe the sectarian line or face consequences.\n\nThree people look toward a gaping hole in a building.\n\nThe weaponization of the bulldozer has already widened the cleavage between Hindus and Muslims in India. But the instigation of division through political symbols is nothing new. Hindu-nationalist forces have long used religious imagery and idioms as tools in the politics of belonging and othering. Today, BJP leaders still promote the idea that the two communities are unified blocs with distinct, and often opposing, interests. Adityanath has often used the slogan \u201cBatenge toh katenge\u201d\u2014that is, Hindus will be slaughtered if they are divided\u2014invoking it after the 2024 elections, urging the community to stay united. And during the recent state election campaign in Maharashtra, Modi reiterated Adityanath\u2019s message, saying, \u201cWe are safe if we are together.\u201d The implicit message (often made explicit) is that the opposition Indian National Congress party is responsible for dividing Indians, by playing intercaste politics among Hindus.\n\nIndia\u2019s diversity is reduced to a religious binary, with Muslims depicted as a group that poses a threat and needs to be disciplined. The bulldozer enacts this discipline.\n\nIn India, the putative home of religious diversity, Hindu nationalism is thus actively advancing social fragmentation. The BJP-controlled government amplifies the anxieties of Hindu society about the Muslim minority, which produces prejudices that, in turn, influence electoral politics and policy. This pattern of mutual reinforcement offers no guarantee of electoral success, as the BJP saw last year. But it nevertheless deepens societal divides and threatens to worsen the precarious position of Muslims and other minorities for generations.\n\nThe bulldozer is the latest avatar of this destructive majoritarian politics. Yet there is now a glimmer of hope\u2014albeit a tenuous one\u2014that Indian Muslims may be spared its use in a physical, if not symbolic, sense. Last November, after four years of bulldozer justice, India\u2019s Supreme Court delivered a judgment denouncing extrajudicial demolitions. In its ruling, the court criticized the authorities\u2019 bypassing of due process, deeming such actions unconstitutional. The response so far from Adityanath and Modi has been a conspicuous silence.\n\nEven if the era of state-sanctioned bulldozer justice is over, though, the deep social scars it has produced are likely irreversible. The bulldozer will remain indelibly imprinted in the collective memory of Hindus and Muslims alike.",
