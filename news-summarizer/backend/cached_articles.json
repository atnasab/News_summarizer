                "text": "Bangkok, Thailand CNN \u2014\n\nHundreds of same-sex couples are tying the knot across Thailand on Thursday as the country becomes the first in Southeast Asia to recognize marriage equality.\n\nThe landmark bill marks a momentous win for the LGBTQ+ community, which has fought for more than a decade for the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the happiest day of my life. We could finally and completely do what we have been wanting to do for a long time,\u201d Pisit Sirihiranchai, who married his partner of five years Chanathip Sirihiranchai, told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe are now a complete family,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the legislation, passed by Thailand\u2019s parliament and endorsed by the king last year, same-sex couples are able to register their marriages with full legal, financial, and medical rights, as well as adoption and inheritance rights.\n\n\u201cThis marriage equality law marks the beginning of Thai society\u2019s greater awareness of gender diversity, and our embrace of everyone regardless of sexual orientation, race, or religion \u2014 our affirmation that everyone is entitled to equal rights and dignity,\u201d Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said in a recorded message played at a mass wedding in the capital Bangkok on Thursday.\n\nA couple poses for pictures during a mass celebration. Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSame-sex couples can register their marriage at a celebration event. Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA couple signs their marriage papers in Bangkok. Kocha Olarn/CNN\n\nAt least 200 couples signed up to get married at the Siam Paragon shopping center, according to Bangkok Pride, which co-organized the event with local authorities.\n\nA rainbow carpet was rolled out at the mall to welcome the newlyweds from all ages and walks of life, including police officer Sirihiranchai who turned up in uniform with his partner.\n\nAmong those to walk down the \u201cpride carpet\u201d was an elderly lesbian couple who toured the venue with former prime minister Srettha Thavisin to a backdrop of falling confetti and traditional Thai beats. Srettha\u2019s ruling Pheu Thai party has backed the marriage bill.\n\nSome embraced the full celebratory spirit by turning up in wedding suits and dresses. Others donned pink or white blazers and dresses. Many waved the rainbow flag.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrities and drag queens performed on a stage adorned with rainbow hearts and flowers, with a screen proudly declaring, \u201cmarriage equality.\u201d\n\nPolice Sergeant Major Pisit Sirihiranchai, right, shows off his ring with his husband\n\nChanathip Sirihiranchai. Mark Philips/CNN\n\nCelebrations are also taking place Thursday in other parts of the country stretching from the eastern coastal city of Pattaya to the mountainous northern city of Chiang Mai.\n\nAhead of the festivities, equality campaigners hailed the new legislation as a victory for progression.\n\n\u201cThis could be a model for the world because we now have Thailand as a model,\u201d said Kittinun Daramadhaj, a lawyer and president of the Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand. \u201cThere is true marriage equality in Thailand.\u201d\n\nA dream comes true\n\nFor some, such as Nina Chetniphat Chuadkhunthod, who was planning to attend the mass celebration at Siam Paragon, the day feels long overdue.\n\nThe transgender woman has not been able to marry her boyfriend of 22 years because she is unable to legally change her gender identity. But with same-sex marriage now being recognized, they can tie the knot.\n\n\u201cI feel like, wow, my dream is close to coming true,\u201d the 42-year-old told CNN during a recent interview.\n\nChuadkhunthod and her fianc\u00e9e held their wedding party three weeks ago. At a wedding hall on the outskirts of Bangkok, the couple walked down the aisle in locked arms, as bridesmaids sprinkled their path with rose petals amid cheers from friends and relatives. They planned to register their marriage on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI felt the proudest moment of my life that I could do this and let people know, let the industry and friends around me know that I could do it,\u201d she said.\n\nNina Chetniphat Chuadkhunthod, right, and her husband light a candle during their wedding at the Vivace Wedding Hall in Bangkok. Courtesy of Nina Chetniphat Chuadkhunthod\n\nOne factor adding particular urgency for the couple is the 7-year-old girl they have been raising as their daughter for three years. The girl is the daughter of Chuadkhunthod\u2019s uncle, who is unable to look after her.\n\nThey plan to adopt the girl and live a life as a family, but cannot do so without a valid marriage.\n\n\u201cI had tears flowing from my eyes when we were thinking about our lives (without the same-sex marriage law). What if \u2026 I, or he, or even my daughter fell ill, who would look after us?\u201d she said.\n\nBut now, she said: \u201cI can confidently say that I can do it, building a family of my own.\u201d\n\nPhilippine national Ana Boncan met her Thai girlfriend Siri Wattanavikij through a dating app six years ago when she was working in Europe. In 2020, Boncan moved to Bangkok to be with her.\n\n\u201cWith this opportunity to get legally married here in Thailand, it gives us the opportunity to have a marriage visa,\u201d Boncan said.\n\nOne thing on the couple\u2019s mind is the possibility of one of them falling ill, and the other being barred from visiting or making life-and-death decisions due to the lack of a marriage certificate.\n\n\u201cWhen we go to the hospital, I can tell them that this is my wife, this is my partner, she makes decisions for me, things like that. Unlike before, they wouldn\u2019t accept it in the hospital,\u201d Boncan said.\n\nThe fight goes on\n\nBut rights experts have warned Thailand may well be the last Asian jurisdiction to recognize same-sex marriage for some time, given the incremental progress elsewhere in the region.\n\nMore than 30 jurisdictions worldwide now recognize same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center, but most advances have been made in Europe, the Americas and Australasia.\n\nThailand is the third in Asia to recognize same-sex marriage after Taiwan in 2019 and Nepal four years later.\n\nA gay couple makes a toast during a mass wedding banquet in front of the Presidential Palace in Taipei, Taiwan on May 25, 2019.

Prakash Mathema/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBack in Thailand, the fight for equal rights continues for other sexual minorities, such as transgender people.\n\nRights advocate Hua Boonyapisomparn, from local advocacy group Foundation of Transgender Alliance for Human Rights, said the next milestone is for the Thai government to let transgender people change their gender identity.\n\nThe country is home to an estimated 314,000 trans people, according to the Asia Pacific Transgender Network.\n\nThere is a commonly held conception that trans people are widely embraced in Thailand, partly due to how accessible gender affirming surgery is in the country, and the prominence of trans entertainers.\n\nBut local transgender people, including Chuadkhunthod, would testify to the day-to-day discrimination they face.\n\n\u201cEven now, as a Thai person, they still look down on us, seeing us as a joke. They laugh and smile, nudging each other while looking at us,\u201d she said.\n\nParliament rejected a proposed gender recognition bill last February during the previous military-backed government led by Prayut Chan-o-cha. Activists are now trying to put it back on the political agenda.\n\n\u201cWe should use marriage equality as an opportunity to open another door for gender recognition,\u201d Boonyapisomparn said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRecord ocean heat has taken a devastating toll on one of the world\u2019s greatest natural wonders, with coral bleaching on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef reaching \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels, a new study has found.\n\nMore than 50% of affected corals monitored near an island in the reef\u2019s south were killed last year during the most \u201csevere and widespread bleaching\u201d to ever hit the area, according to a team of Australian scientists.\n\nIn 2024, the reef experienced its worst summer on record. Soaring ocean temperatures smashed records, causing the reef\u2019s seventh mass bleaching event. Corals are bleached white when marine heat waves put corals under stress, causing them to expel algae from their tissue, draining their color.\n\nThe culprit is the burning of planet-heating fossil fuels, which is driving up global temperatures. Coral damage was also accelerated last year by the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which heats ocean temperatures in this part of the world.\n\nScientists from the University of Sydney tracked 462 coral colonies at the reef\u2019s One Tree Island over the course of five months last year, beginning at the heat wave\u2019s peak in early February.\n\nBleached Acropora table coral in One Tree Island reef in April, 2024. Byrne Lab/The University of Sydney\n\nBy May, 370 of those colonies were bleached and, by July, 52% of the bleached corals were dead, according to the peer-reviewed study published in Limnology and Oceanography Letters.\n\nSome coral species monitored had a mortality rate of 95%, with researchers observing the start of \u201ccolony collapse\u201d where the dead skeleton detaches from the reef and turns to rubble.\n\nAnother species, the Goniopora, became infected by black band disease, which invades the coral\u2019s tissue and can kill it.\n\n\u201cOur findings underscore the urgent need for action to protect coral reefs, which are not only biodiversity hotspots but also crucial for food security and coastal protection,\u201d said lead author Maria Byrne, from the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the university.\n\nByrne said the area studied is in a protected part of the reef, far from the coast and free from mining activities and tourism.\n\nBut the reef, \u201cdespite its protected status, was not immune to the extreme heat stress that triggered this catastrophic bleaching event,\u201d she said.\n\nCovering nearly 133,000 square miles (345,000 square kilometers), the Great Barrier Reef is the world\u2019s largest coral reef, home to more than 1,500 species of fish and 411 species of hard corals. It contributes billions of dollars to the Australian economy each year, mainly through tourism, and is promoted heavily to foreign visitors as one of the country\u2019s \u2013 and the world\u2019s \u2013 greatest natural wonders.\n\nThe authors said mass bleaching is becoming \u201ca biennial event\u201d and as such \u201creinforces the need for urgent global action now to adhere to ambitious climate and reduced emissions targets.\u201d\n\nBleached Acropora coral on One Tree Island reef, in April 2024. Byrne Lab/The University of Sydney\n\nThe bleaching hit areas of the reef not impacted before, and disease and death were found in coral species considered resilient, the study found.\n\n\u201cSeeing the impacts on a reef that has largely avoided mass bleaching until now is devastating,\u201d said Shawna Foo, a marine scientist and co-author of the study. \u201cThe high rates of mortality and disease, particularly in such a remote and pristine area, highlight the severity of the situation.\u201d\n\nIn February last year, CNN witnessed bleaching on five different reefs spanning the northern and southern parts of the ecologically important but fragile site.\n\nSevere mass bleaching at the Great Barrier Reef had previously been observed in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe 2022 bleaching was the first during a La Ni\u00f1a event, El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s counterpart, which tends to have a cooling influence \u2013 raising serious concerns about the reef\u2019s outlook.\n\nOne Tree Island coral before bleaching, in April 2022. Byrne Lab/The University of Sydney\n\nThe authors said their research was a \u201cwake-up call for policymakers and conservationists\u201d as its implications extend beyond ecology and conservation to communities that depend on the reef for fishing, tourism and coastal protection.\n\n\u201cThe resilience of coral reefs is being tested like never before, and we must prioritize strategies that enhance their ability to withstand climate change,\u201d said Ana Vila Concejo, co-author of the study from the university\u2019s School of Geosciences.\n\n\u201cOur findings underscore the need for immediate and effective management interventions to safeguard these ecosystems.\u201d",

                "text": "Taipei, Taiwan AP \u2014\n\nChina\u2019s navy has commissioned a new-generation frigate as competition rises with the US and other regional powers, saying the ship will \u201cplay a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness\u201d of its forces.\n\nChina already has the world\u2019s largest navy in terms of number of hulls, although its technology is sometimes seen as lagging. Its largest competitor, the US, has warned its Navy could be outnumbered and has called for a building program as well as reforms to put damaged ships into action sooner.\n\nChina\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy operates mainly in waters off the Chinese east coast and in the huge and strategically crucial South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety. A key mission also remains backing up the army in any attack on Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy about 160 kilometers (100 miles) off the Chinese coast that Beijing has vowed to annex by force if necessary.\n\nThe first Type 054B frigate, christened the Luohe, was commissioned Wednesday in Qingdao, a port city in northern China where the PLAN\u2019s northern fleet is based.\n\nThe ship has a displacement of approximately 5,000 tons and includes stealth technology, combat command systems and firepower integration, \u201csignificantly enhancing overall performance,\u201d the navy said.\n\n\u201cWith strong capabilities for comprehensive combat operations and diverse military missions, the warship will play a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness of naval task forces,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Luohe\u2019s armaments include a variety of machine guns for close combat and anti-air and anti-ship missiles, according to defense publications, some of which say the ship could become the backbone of the Chinese navy.\n\nThe statement said nothing about future 054Bs, but at least two more are believed to have been launched and another is under construction. China has around 234 warships compared to the US Navy\u2019s 219, including around 50 frigates and the same number of destroyers. China has two operating aircraft carriers and another undergoing sea trials, along with a massive and powerful coast guard.\n\nRecent wargames have shown China would lose many more vessels in a simulated clash with the US, but would be able to absorb the losses and continue fighting.\n\nThe PLAN has also sent ships further abroad including the Mediterranean Sea and the Caribbean in its attempts to use its navy as an extension of its growing economic and diplomatic clout. PLAN and Chinese coast guard ships have also patrolled in the East China Sea, where China claims a group of uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. While planes and ships from both sides have come into contact, no shots have been fired during such incidents.\n\nThe US and other nations have deliberately sailed close to islands, some of them human-made, to challenge China\u2019s claim to them. Beijing has ignored a UN-backed court\u2019s ruling that threw out most of China\u2019s territorial claims.",

                "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping vowed to take his country\u2019s ties with Russia to a new level this year in a video conference with counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, hours after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe two leaders have made it an annual tradition to speak around the new year \u2013 a feature of a close personal rapport that\u2019s helped cement a partnership between their countries that\u2019s only grown as Putin wages war on Ukraine.\n\nXi expressed his readiness to \u201cguide China-Russia relations to a new height\u201d and respond to \u201cexternal uncertainties\u201d with the \u201cstability and resilience of China-Russia ties,\u201d a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nThe two countries should deepen \u201cstrategic coordination\u201d and \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d and \u201cfirmly support each other,\u201d Xi told the Russian president, who appeared via video link on a large screen in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People during the conference call.\n\nThe call between the two autocrats comes as both closely watch Trump\u2019s return to the White House.\n\nThe newly sworn-in American president has signaled interest in meeting or negotiating with both leaders early in his presidency. Since taking office, however, he\u2019s also continued to threaten China with imminent tariffs and made some of his most critical comments of Putin to date, as he seeks an end to Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine.\n\nIn a social media post Wednesday, Trump threatened that if Russia\u2019s \u201cridiculous war\u201d in Ukraine did not end soon he would slap \u201chigh levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions\u201d on Russian products being sold in the US. It\u2019s unclear, however, what impact any further measures could have, given years of hefty sanctions from the Biden administration and US allies already straining the Russian economy.\n\nA reset in relations\n\nBoth Putin and Xi have each publicly suggested a hope to reset fraught relations with the US under the new administration.\n\nXi and Trump held their own call Friday ahead of the inauguration, where Xi advocated a \u201cnew starting point\u201d for advancing US-China relations.\n\nThe conversation touched on a range of topics including the war in Ukraine, Trump later said, calling it a \u201cvery good\u201d call.\n\nXi told Putin about that phone call during the two leaders\u2019 more than hour-and-a-half conversation Tuesday, according to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, who added that the timing of the Xi-Putin call was unrelated to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cIssues of the two countries\u2019 relations with the United States were also raised,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, the leaders, naturally, discussed certain aspects of the development of potential contacts with the US administration,\u201d Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nPutin in his remarks to Xi also hailed the countries\u2019 expanding trade \u2013 which Chinese data show hit a record high last year \u2013 and alluded to their shared ambitions to reshape a global order they see as unfairly dominated by the United States.\n\n\u201cWe stand united in advocating for a more just multipolar world order and work to ensure indivisible security both in the Eurasian space and globally,\u201d Putin said, according to a Kremlin readout. Moscow and Beijing\u2019s joint efforts \u201cobjectively play a major stabilizing role in international affairs,\u201d he claimed.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping via video link from a state residence outside Moscow on January 21, 2025. Gavriil Grigorov/pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA diplomatic triangle?\n\nTrump has also suggested he hopes Xi can use his sway to play a role in brokering an end to that conflict, noting that he urged the Chinese leader during their recent call to \u201cget it settled.\u201d\n\nEuropean leaders have long hoped that Xi could play a role bringing Putin around to accepting Ukraine\u2019s peace terms, but the entrance of Trump into the White House and his stated drive to end the war adds new potential for China to play a role.\n\nThat could set up a delicate balancing act for Beijing. Xi has long sought to portray China as a potential peace broker in the conflict, even as the US and its allies have accused Beijing of propping up the Russian war effort with the export of dual-use goods, which Beijing denies. Xi is also seen to be keen to build good rapport with Trump to avert potentially damaging tariffs at a time of economic weakness in China.\n\nBut the Chinese leader will also likely want to be careful not to damage his partnership with Russia. Xi and Putin inked a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership weeks before Putin\u2019s invasion and Xi sees his Russian counterpart as a critical partner among broader frictions with the West.\n\nNeither the readout from the Kremlin nor China\u2019s Foreign Ministry specified whether the war in Ukraine was discussed during Tuesday\u2019s call between Putin and Xi.\n\nInstead, both readouts referred to the 80th anniversary of the allied victory shared by Beijing and Moscow in World War II. Xi and Putin had each invited the other to commemorate that victory together this year, with events in Russia in May and China in September, the Kremlin said Tuesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Matthew Chance, Anna Chernova and Fred He contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nInternational pressure is mounting on Thailand \u2013 including from the new US administration \u2013 over the fate of dozens of Uyghur men held in detention for more than a decade, following reports the Thai government planned to deport the group to China.\n\nUnited Nations experts on Tuesday urged Thailand to \u201cimmediately halt the possible transfer,\u201d warning the men were at \u201creal risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned.\u201d\n\nConcerns for the 48 men, who have been detained in Bangkok since 2014, are growing after a Uyghur activist shared a voice note from one of the detainees, who said the men had been on hunger strike since January 10 in a desperate protest against deportation.\n\nArslan Hidayat, an activist working with Justice for All\u2019s Save Uyghur campaign, told CNN he understands the men remained on hunger strike as of Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are still on hunger strike, still in a dangerous position\u2026 since we\u2019ve been on hunger strike we are not feeling so well,\u201d the detainee said in a voice note to Hidayat. The detainee said they wish to be sent to a third country and \u201clive in peace\u201d with their families.\n\nThe 48 men were arrested by Thai authorities 11 years ago after crossing the border to Thailand in an attempt to escape persecution in China. They were part of a larger group of about 350 people detained at the time, some of whom were minors, according to previous reports from UN experts, rights groups, and Uyghur campaigners.\n\nFive Uyghur detainees, including a newborn and a 3-year-old, have died in detention, the reports said.\n\nHuman rights groups and campaigners say that in the years since, the men have been held \u201cin life-threatening conditions\u201d without access to lawyers, family members or UN representatives. Human Rights Watch said the men were living in \u201csqualid conditions with poor hygiene and inadequate medical care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are informed that 23 of the 48 individuals suffer from serious health conditions, including diabetes, kidney dysfunction, paralysis of the lower body, skin diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses, and heart and lung conditions,\u201d the eight UN experts said Tuesday. They include the UN special rapporteurs on torture and on migrants\u2019 human rights, and other independent human rights experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.\n\n\u201cIt is essential they be provided with the necessary and appropriate medical care,\u201d the UN experts added.\n\nFears the 48 would be imminently transferred to Chinese custody arose on January 8 when Thai authorities reportedly gave the detainees \u201cvoluntary return\u201d documents to sign, according to the Save Uyghur campaign. Detainees told the group their photos were taken, and reported an increase in threats of deportation from officials in the immigration detention center.\n\nThai officials have denied plans to deport the Uyghurs, according to local media. CNN has reached out to Thai police and the country\u2019s defense minister for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday: \u201cThe matter involves judicial cooperation between two sovereign states.\u201d\n\nUN experts should abide by the principle of the UN charter and \u201crefrain from interfering with the judicial sovereignty of the member states \u2026 rather than making irresponsible remarks,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing.\n\nLong persecuted minority\n\nThe predominately Muslim Uyghurs are a distinct ethnic minority from Xinjiang, a massive, nominally autonomous region in the far west of China.\n\nChina\u2019s repression of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang has been labeled \u201cgenocide\u201d by the US and other countries, with widespread and credible reports of arbitrary detention, mass surveillance, forced labor and restrictions on movement \u2013 allegations China vehemently denies.\n\nA landmark 2022 report from the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights said China had committed \u201cserious human rights violations\u201d against the Uyghurs, documenting what it described as arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominately Muslim groups.\n\nAt the time, more than 1 million Uyghur and other Muslim minority peoples were estimated to be held in extrajudicial camps for \u201cre-education\u201d and indoctrination. Descriptions of detentions \u201cwere marked by patterns of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d the UN report found.\n\nChina has fiercely denied committing rights violations. It has previously said it established such centers to counter \u201cextremism\u201d in the region, and has since said the facilities were closed.\n\nA letter from the 48 detainees dated January 10 said: \u201cWe urgently appeal to all international organizations and countries concerned with human rights to intervene immediately to save us from this tragic fate before it is too late.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Watch said they face \u201crisks of enforced disappearance, long-term imprisonment, torture, and other severe mistreatment,\u201d if they are forcibly repatriated.\n\nPressure on Thailand\n\nAmong the prominent voices adding pressure on Thailand was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told his Senate confirmation hearing ahead of being sworn in Tuesday that he would lobby Bangkok against deporting the Uyghur men.\n\n\u201cThailand is actually a very strong US partner, strong historical ally as well,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how important that relationship (is) and how close it is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, wrote a letter to Thailand\u2019s Ambassador to the US last week expressing his alarm over the reports and urged the government to release the men to a third country.\n\nThe UN experts also called on Thailand, which is a member of the UN Human Rights Council, to respect its obligations under international law.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition on refoulement prohibits the return or transfer in any manner whatsoever to a country where there is real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Southeast Asian kingdom is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and does not recognize the concept of asylum. Thailand has a history of pushing refugees back across its borders and of deporting dissidents.\n\nIn 2015, Thailand deported 100 Uyghurs to China, sparking international outcry. The fate and whereabouts of those returned are unknown, UN experts said last year.\n\nIn the same move, more than 170 Uyghur women and children were voluntarily transferred to Turkey. Many families were separated, including those of the men still in detention in Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe call for a prompt, effective investigation, and assessment of all the circumstances of the arrest and continued deprivation of liberty of this group of persons,\u201d the UN experts said Tuesday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kocha Olarn contributed to this report from Bangkok, Thailand.",

In early January, confirmation came that he had finally secured an appointment.\n\nBut a day before the appointment, a stroke of President Donald Trump\u2019s pen shut down the US immigration processing app known as CBP One \u2013 and with it, Cabrera\u2019s hopes.\n\n\u201cSo much time waiting, and now this surprise,\u201d Cabrera said with a voice of defeat. \u201cThey shut off our dreams.\u201d\n\nUntil Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, migrants seeking asylum from violence or persecution had the option to schedule an appointment at a legal US port of entry to make their case.\n\n\u201cWe are left adrift, we have no resources left, we arrived in Juarez with money to pay for one night in a hotel,\u201d the native Venezuelan said.\n\nCabrera is one of several migrants CNN spoke to who recently arrived in Ciudad Juarez after weeks of travel for their CBP One appointments, only to find the sessions they had been given were canceled.\n\nNow, many are stranded with no money or any sense of what to do next.\n\nIt was just below freezing in Ciudad Juarez on Monday when Cabrera realized what had happened, but he and his family decided to still try to explain the situation to US immigration authorities at the Paso del Norte bridge, which connects the Mexican city with the Texas city of El Paso.\n\n\u201cI had a thread of hope,\u201d Cabrera told CNN, fighting the cold in a leather jacket and with a winter mask covering most of his face.\n\nBut they were quickly turned away. Cabrera and his family were instead directed to a local Mexican public agency for further guidance. There, they were given some warm soup, but got little information on how to pursue their case.\n\n\u2018We did everything legally\u2019\n\nErlianny Colombie, 41, left Cuba seven months ago and had been living in the southern Mexico town of Tapachula along with three relatives.\n\nAfter finding a place to work and live in Tapachula, he applied for an appointment with US officials.\n\n\u201cWe got lucky, we got an appointment,\u201d Colombie told CNN. \u201cSo, we bought bus tickets, we obtained permission to move through Mexico, a lot of sacrifice, we did everything legally.\u201d\n\nBut the travel and costs of obtaining paperwork stretched his resources to breaking point. \u201cWe had enough money for the night before our appointment (\u2026) and now we are on the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nColombie \u2013 who says he fled Cuba due to political persecution \u2013 says he \u201cunderstands\u201d Trump\u2019s decision but asks the president to reconsider for those who already had an appointment.\n\nErlianny Colombie from Cuba, holds his CBP One appointment confirmation for Tuesday, January 21. Abel Alvarado/CNN\n\nVenezuelan migrant Jose Guillermo Cabera shows his CBP One appointment confirmation for Tuesday, January 21 Abel Alvarado/CNN\n\n\u201cIf we already were in the process, Mr. Trump, please continue with the scheduled appointments, don\u2019t leave us here stranded,\u201d he said.\n\nThe sentiment is echoed by other migrants, who say they carefully followed the rules given to them by the United States, and deserve to be heard out.\n\n\u201cGive us another opportunity,\u201d Venezuelan migrant Rosalyn Vargas, 33, asked of Trump.\n\n\u201cWe came here for a brighter future, we are human beings, we did everything legally, we followed the process,\u201d Vargas said from a shelter where she\u2019s staying with other relatives.\n\n\u201cWe all have a story to tell. I fled Venezuela because I was being persecuted, please give us our appointments back,\u201d her compatriot Oswal Paredes told CNN.\n\nWho is helping the migrants at the border?\n\nMigrant shelters in Ciudad Juarez are taking in some of the migrants who have now been stranded.\n\nCasa del Migrante, a shelter about 10 miles from the border, says they are offering shelter, food and psychological help to migrants whose appointments were canceled.\n\n\u201cRight now, they are emotionally destroyed, after battling so much, all the walking, a lot of them crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap,\u201d Ivonne Lopez, a social worker, from Casa del Migrante told CNN, referring to a treacherous jungle passage that many migrants must make on foot to cross from South America to North America.\n\n\u201cThey want a sign of hope, they want to know what\u2019s going to happen with them, they had their appointment canceled, but is there another option,\u201d Lopez said, adding that \u201cthankfully, they have lawyers helping the migrants.\u201d\n\nSome local officials have taken a blunter approach with migrants, underlining that it\u2019s unrealistic to keep trying to reach the US.\n\n\u201cWe have to tell it like it is, sadly, all appointments are suspended as well as any possibility of getting one,\u201d Enrique Serrano, a coordinator from Chihuahua state\u2019s population agency told CNN.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t obtain anything by trying at the crossing points hoping for the US to receive them,\u201d he said.\n\nSerrano says Mexican city, state and federal officials are working together to address the migrant crisis in Ciudad Juarez and other border towns.\n\n\u201cMigrants here should stay calm, there are no instructions for raids here on the Mexican side, the instructions we\u2019ve been given is to give them proper treatment,\u201d Serrano said.\n\n\u201cShelters in Juarez are at 40% capacity,\u201d Serrano also said, noting that many Mexican border towns are expanding protective spaces in anticipation of mass deportations from the US.\n\nFor now, all of the migrants CNN interviewed said they would not give up \u2013 preferring to remain in limbo near the border and continue to hope their voices reach Trump, after having come so close.\n\n\u201cEverything changed from one moment to another, we went from hope to desperation,\u201d 23-year-old Fabian Delgado said from a shelter.",

                "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nHis inauguration speech was loudest in its silence on Ukraine. But hours later, US President Donald Trump laid bare \u2013 in a trademark casual, rambling fashion \u2013 his position over the war in Ukraine. And it was tougher on the Kremlin than you might expect.\n\nTalking to reporters in the White House, he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin: \u201cHe should make a deal. I think he\u2019s destroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d\n\nTrump was unprecedentedly stark, focusing on the economic damage done to Russia by the war. \u201cI think Russia is going to be in big trouble. You take a look at their economy. You take a look at their inflation in Russia,\u201d he added, referring to price rises edging towards 10%. \u201cI got along with him great. I would hope he wants to make a deal.\u201d\n\nHe loosely referenced Moscow\u2019s staggering casualty rates in a war now nearing its fourth year in which Western officials estimate 700,000 Russians have been killed or injured.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be thrilled,\u201d Trump said of Putin. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing so well. I mean, he\u2019s grinding it out\u2026 it\u2019s not making him look very good\u2026 I think he would be well off to end that war.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would meet with Putin, and the details were being arranged. \u201cCould be very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war Ukraine and Russia should have never started,\u201d he added. Reminded he had promised to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being in office, he joked: \u201cI have another half day left. We\u2019ll see. We want to get it done.\u201d\n\nTrump said Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky had told him he wants to make a deal \u2013 an echo of recent comments from Kyiv they were open to diplomacy, provided it created a sustainable end to the war that is palatable to Ukraine. \u201cZelensky wants to make a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Putin does. He might not. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nZelensky welcomed Trump\u2019s inauguration, saying he was a \u201cstrong man,\u201d adding: \u201cUkrainians are ready to work together with Americans to achieve peace, real peace. This is a chance that must be seized.\u201d\n\nThe comments constitute some of the most critical Trump has made of the Kremlin head. His focus on economic mismanagement and the Kremlin\u2019s tolerance of horrific casualty rates, suggest his White House is aware Russia may be under some time pressure and intend to exploit it.\n\nPreviously, throughout their campaign for the White House, both Trump and Vice President JD Vance had expressed skepticism of continued American involvement in Ukraine\u2019s fight, often suggesting that Ukraine ought to settle for a truce with Russia despite the loss of its territory.\n\nThe president\u2019s assertion he wants to meet Putin suggests Trump thinks his interpersonal \u201cart of the deal\u201d may forge a diplomatic path.\n\nComfortingly also for Kyiv, his reference to aid for Ukraine leant on the need for European NATO members to pay more, rather than for US assistance to stop. Trump began his exchange with reporters by criticizing NATO\u2019s European members, saying they needed to pay 5% of their GDP in defense \u2013 almost double for many.\n\nTrump said the United States was funding Ukraine\u2019s assistance to the tune of $200 billion more than Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean between.\u201d",

                "text": "Seoul, South Korea (Reuters) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol attended on Tuesday a Constitutional Court hearing of his impeachment trial where he denied ordering military commanders to drag lawmakers out of parliament during his short-lived bid to impose martial law.\n\nNear the start of the hearing, Yoon said he had worked in public service with \u201ca firm commitment to free democracy,\u201d when invited by the acting chief justice, Moon Hyung-bae, to speak.\n\nDressed in a navy-colored suit with a burgundy tie, Yoon, a career prosecutor before his 2022 election as president, pledged to answer any questions the court might have.\n\nYoon has been incarcerated since last week under a separate criminal probe on charges of leading an insurrection with his attempt to impose martial law in early December, a move that shocked the nation and was overturned within hours by parliament.\n\nYoon told the hearing that special forces troops sent to parliament on Dec. 3 were not there to disable the legislature or prevent it from blocking his martial law because he knew such an action would have led to an indefensible crisis.\n\n\u201cIn this country, parliament and news media are far more powerful than the president, in a far superior position,\u201d he told the court.\n\nHis lawyers outlined arguments in defense of Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, saying it was meant to sound the alarm over abuses committed by the opposition Democratic Party.\n\nThey argued the opposition\u2019s actions had paralyzed government and pushed the country\u2019s democratic and constitutional order to the brink of collapse.\n\n\u201cThe decree was intended simply to establish the format of martial law and never intended to be executed, nor was it possible to execute it because of the potential for conflict with higher-level laws,\u201d lawyer Cha Gi-hwan told the court.\n\nCha also denied testimony by military commanders involved in the martial law declaration who said Yoon and his top aides ordered the arrest of some members of parliament who had politically clashed with the president.\n\nThe opposition Democratic Party, joined by minority parties and also 12 members of Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, voted with a two-thirds majority to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14.\n\nHelicopters landing at parliament\n\nThe Constitutional Court began the trial on Dec. 27 to review an impeachment motion that accused Yoon of violating his constitutional duty by imposing martial law with no justifiable grounds.\n\nThe parliament\u2019s legal team presented testimony from military commanders and video footage showing military helicopters landing on parliament grounds with special forces troops breaking into the main building, as well as troops moving in on the National Election Commission.\n\nOne of the lawyers also criticized unproven claims of irregularities at the election commission, which Yoon cited as a factor for justifying martial law.\n\n\u201cIn South Korea\u2019s current national chaos, the conspiracy theory of election fraud can destroy our community itself,\u201d said the lawyer.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to remove Yoon from office permanently or reinstate him.\n\nYoon was driven to the hearing from the Seoul Detention Centre, where he is being held, in a correctional service vehicle escorted by a Presidential Security Service motorcade.\n\nHe was permitted to change from the khaki prison uniform he currently has to wear.\n\nAfter the hearing, Yoon visited a medical facility to receive medical attention with prior authorization from the head of the detention center, the Justice Ministry which oversees correctional service said in a statement.\n\nIt did not provide further details on privacy grounds.\n\nYoon\u2019s decision to attend the impeachment hearing contrasts with his vigorous resistance to criminal proceedings against him where he has refused to answer summons by investigators or attend interrogation sessions.\n\nYoon\u2019s legal team has denied he masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even technically by the death penalty.\n\nSecurity was heightened at the Constitutional Court on Tuesday, after a mob of angry Yoon supporters went on a rampage through the district court that issued a warrant to extend his detention early on Sunday.\n\nDozens of police buses were lined bumper-to-bumper on both sides of the street, keeping hundreds of Yoon supporters more than 100 meters (109 yards) away from the court.",

Activists argue that this undermines Iraq\u2019s 1959 Personal Status Law, which unified family law and established safeguards for women.\n\nProponents of the changes, which were advocated by primarily conservative Shiite lawmakers, defend them as a means to align the law with Islamic principles and reduce Western influence on Iraqi culture.\n\nIraqi law currently sets 18 as the minimum age of marriage in most cases. The changes passed Tuesday would let clerics rule according to their interpretation of Islamic law, which some interpret to allow marriage of girls in their early teens \u2013 or as young as 9 under the Jaafari school of Islamic law followed by many Shiite religious authorities in Iraq.\n\nThe parliament also passed a general amnesty law seen as benefiting Sunni detainees and that\u2019s also seen as giving a pass to people involved in corruption and embezzlement. The chamber also passed a land restitution law aimed at addressing Kurdish territorial claims.\n\nIntisar al-Mayali, a human rights activist and a member of the Iraqi Women\u2019s League, said passage of the civil status law amendments \u201cwill leave disastrous effects on the rights of women and girls, through the marriage of girls at an early age, which violates their right to life as children, and will disrupt the protection mechanisms for divorce, custody and inheritance for women.\u201d\n\nThe session ended in chaos and accusations of procedural violations.\n\n\u201cHalf of the lawmakers present in the session did not vote, which broke the legal quorum,\u201d a parliamentary official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. He said that some members protested loudly and others climbed onto the parliamentary podium.\n\nAfter the session, a number of legislators complained about the voting process, under which all three controversial laws \u2014 each of which was supported by different blocs \u2014 were voted on together.\n\n\u201cRegarding the civil status law, we are strongly supporting it and there were no issues with that,\u201d said Raid al Maliki, an independent MP. \u201cBut it was combined with other laws to be voted on together\u2026and this might lead to a legal appeal at the Federal Court.\u201d\n\nParliament Speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani in a statement praised the laws\u2019 passage as \u201can important step in the process of enhancing justice and organizing the daily lives of citizens.\u201d\n\nAlso Tuesday, at least three officers, including the national security chief of the al-Tarmiyah district north of Baghdad, were killed and four others wounded in an explosion at an ammunition depot, a security official said.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media, said the explosion occurred as a joint force of the Iraqi army and the national security service conducted an operation following intelligence reports of the Islamic State group\u2019s activity and an ammunition cache in the area.",

The operation is called \u201cIron Wall,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, Hamas issued a statement calling for \u201cpeople in the West Bank and its revolutionary youth to mobilize and escalate the clash with the occupation army at all points of contact with it.\u201d\n\nThe Palestinian state news agency Wafa said Israeli warplanes struck Jenin and Israeli forces, including sharpshooters and armored vehicles, were surrounding the city\u2019s refugee camp and stopping ambulances from entering.\n\nVideos from local journalists showed a large number of armored vehicles, including bulldozers, entering Jenin. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 10 people \u2013 nine men and one teenage boy \u2013 were killed and 40 injured in the city.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether those killed were bystanders or engaged in hostilities with Israeli forces. Videos from the scene seem to show that at least two were civilians who appeared to be unarmed. Local residents told CNN that a man who was shot and later pronounced dead in a hospital in Jenin was a civilian.\n\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad\u2019s armed wing Al Quds Brigades said its fighters were firing at advancing Israeli troops around the refugee camp.\n\nIslamic Jihad said Israeli military operation is an attempt by Netanyahu to save his \u201cfaltering government coalition\u201d and spoil the \u201cjoy\u201d after Palestinian prisoners were released in the West Bank as part of the Gaza truce.\n\n\u201cWe call on our people throughout the occupied West Bank to confront this criminal campaign by all means, thwart its goals, and consolidate the enemy\u2019s defeat in subduing the will of our people in the West Bank and Gaza,\u201d the militant group said in a statement.\n\nThis latest offensive comes after the Israeli military carried out a major and deadly military operation in the northern West Bank in August and September. That campaign was called \u201cOperation Summer Camps.\u201d\n\nNew \u2018war goal\u2019\n\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right nationalist who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, said in a statement Tuesday that security in the West Bank had been added to the country\u2019s \u201cwar goals.\u201d CNN has asked the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for confirmation of that claim.\n\n\u201cAfter Gaza and Lebanon, today, with God\u2019s help, we have begun to change the security concept in Judea and Samaria and in the campaign to eradicate terrorism in the region,\u201d he said, using the biblical name by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.\n\nSmotrich had publicly toyed with quitting the Israeli government over the Gaza ceasefire, but decided to stay in the cabinet after saying he had received assurances from Netanyahu on his commitment to continue Israel\u2019s military operations.\n\nThere has been a significant uptick in violence in the occupied West Bank since the ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, the outgoing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the military \u201cmust be ready for significant operations\u201d in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) in Ramallah said Monday that it was \u201calarmed\u201d by this new wave of violence by Israeli settlers and security forces in the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli security forces shot and killed a reportedly unarmed 14-year-old Palestinian boy on Sunday, the OHCHR said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe OHCHR said \u201cscores of settlers\u201d stormed several Palestinian towns on Sunday, torching houses and vehicles, blocking roads and throwing stones.\n\nThe attacks continued on Monday, residents of Al-Funduq, a town east of Qalqilya, told CNN. They said a large group of armed settlers set fire to vehicles and shops in the town, throwing stones and firing towards houses before moving to a nearby village where they burnt two tractors and a plantation nursery, as well as caused damage to a house.\n\nThe international community has long condemned settler violence which has increased in recent years and gone mostly unpunished.\n\nThe US, under the Biden administration, had imposed sanctions against several Israeli settlers allegedly responsible for deadly violence but those sanctions have now been rescinded, with the decision to do so among the slew of executive orders US President Donald Trump signed upon taking office on Monday. The following day, Trump\u2019s nominee to be US ambassador to the UN, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, said she agreed with the view espoused by a number of far-right politicians in Israel that Israel has \u201ca biblical right\u201d to annex the West Bank.\n\nJewish settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law and the United Nations\u2019 top court said in July that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem was illegal.\n\nRegarding the latest bout of violence, the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem said that \u201csettlers, backed, escorted, and with full cooperation (of) the Israeli army,\u201d attacked Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on settler attacks in several parts of the territory.\n\nThe IDF said it and the police responded to reports of riots in Al-Funduq on Monday and two settlers were shot by the police during that response, according to a statement from the police.\n\nIsrael\u2019s emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) said it treated two casualties, one in \u201ccritical condition\u201d and one in \u201cserious condition.\u201d Both patients had \u201cpenetrating injuries\u201d and were evacuated to the Meir hospital, according to the MDA.\n\nA joint statement from several Israeli commanders said on Tuesday that initial investigation indicated that \u201cdozens of Israeli civilians, some of whom were masked, arrived at the area of Al-Funduq, instigated riots, set property on fire, and caused damage.\u201d\n\nThe IDF\u2019s response to the settler attack in Al-Funduq sparked more violence on Tuesday. The police said 17 people were arrested and three police officers injured during a protest over the shooting of the settlers.\n\nIsraeli troops and settlers have killed at least 851 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack, including 173 children. Meanwhile, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008, according to the UN, which recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis \u2013 15 soldiers and 19 civilians. Of those civilians, seven were settlers.",

Enter with sound Enter without sound\n\nCNN Special Report How Gaza\u2019s hospitals became battlegrounds\n\nRelentless bombardment, power outages and shortages have pushed nearly every hospital in the beleaguered northern Gaza Strip out of service, with evidence of repeated attacks on and in the vicinity of medical facilities despite the presence of doctors, patients and civilians inside, a CNN analysis has found.\n\nAt least 20 out of 22 hospitals identified by CNN in northern Gaza were damaged or destroyed in the first two months of Israel's war against Hamas, from October 7 to December 7, according to a review of 45 satellite images and around 400 videos from the ground, as well as interviews with doctors, eyewitnesses and humanitarian organizations. Fourteen were directly hit, based on the evidence collected and verified by CNN and analyzed by experts.\n\nIsrael launched its bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terrorist attack, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage. In the first two months of the war, at least 17,100 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on the strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. At the time of publishing, that number was more than 23,400.\n\nIsrael says that Hamas operates inside and underneath hospitals, and is using them for military operations, including as command centers, weapons stores and to hide hostages. The Israelis have released footage they say is evidence of those Hamas operations. The videos do not offer definitive proof, and Hamas has denied the claims.\n\nCNN sent a list of the hospitals identified as damaged or destroyed to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). In response, the IDF said it \u201cdid not conduct any targeted attacks against hospitals in the Gaza Strip,\u201d adding that \u201cHamas systematically misuses hospitals and medical facilities.\u201d\n\nTracking how aerial bombardment has impacted hospitals in northern Gaza gives a sense of the scale and scope of devastation that the war has wrought on the enclave\u2019s health system \u2014 and the knock-on impact to civilians who have relied on the facilities for shelter and care, and are more in need of their services now than ever before.\n\nHospital Damaged or destroyed Gaza City Direct attack Zikim GAZA Med.

Of those, 20 were damaged or destroyed in relentless bombardment during the first two months of the war. Satellite imagery showed craters near 11 of the hospitals were consistent with those left behind by 2,000-pound bombs. The munitions were dropped near enough for the hospitals to be within the lethal fragmentation radius, which is up to 365 meters (about 1,198 feet). Fourteen hospitals were directly hit. Several, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, appeared to have been attacked by Israel.\n\nImagery obtained by CNN showed that two hospitals were completely flattened. Attacks on and around the strip\u2019s three pediatric hospitals forced them to cease services. The only hospitals offering dedicated cancer and psychiatric treatment also stopped operating after having been damaged. By the end of the period reviewed, only four hospitals were partially functioning, according to OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency. None had surgery capacity.\n\nThe International Eye Hospital, in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City, was damaged in early October. It was no longer standing by October 12, according to satellite imagery. Balsam Hospital, in the west of Beit Hanoun, was reduced to rubble by November 3. Craters consistent with 2,000-pound bombs were visible near both medical facilities. Maxar Technologies, photos from November 26, 2023\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said on December 21 that no hospitals were functioning in northern Gaza and injured patients who were unable to be moved were \u201cwaiting to die.\u201d According to the WHO, as of January 10, six hospitals in the north were partially functioning.\n\nTo provide a window into how Gaza\u2019s hospitals became battlegrounds, CNN took an in-depth look at the deterioration of the strip\u2019s biggest and second biggest medical facilities, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, up until they ceased operations in November. Al-Shifa has since resumed some services.\n\nIsraeli authorities say both hospitals have been used by Hamas for military purposes. The IDF published images of a tunnel shaft and military equipment it said its forces found inside the Al-Shifa complex and video of what appeared to be an armed man outside Al-Quds Hospital. Hamas and hospital officials have denied that the militant group has operated from inside the facilities.\n\nTaken together, the two hospitals reflect the similarities CNN observed in reviewing evidence from the first two months of the war: that what should be protected facilities are being bombed, encircled and shot at by tanks, and that surrounding infrastructure, ambulances and roads are being hit, affecting efforts to treat patients, evacuate facilities and deliver aid.\n\nSeveral of the hospitals assessed as part of this analysis, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, appeared to have been attacked by Israel, according to imagery of munitions fragments, large impact craters, tanks, tank shell holes and tracks from heavily armored vehicles. Experts who reviewed the imagery for CNN said that the aftermath was consistent with damage from high-grade military weaponry used by the IDF.\n\nIsraeli flares light up the night sky above Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on November 6, 2023. Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAn earlier CNN investigation determined that a failed Palestinian rocket fired from Gaza was likely the cause of a deadly blast at the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, on October 17.\n\nIn other cases, it was not possible to determine responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe IDF has repeatedly said it does not target hospitals but has admitted to returning fire at some facilities, including Al-Quds. In response to CNN\u2019s analysis, the IDF said that strikes against targets near hospitals \u201cundergo a thorough planning process,\u201d to ensure the munitions chosen mitigate damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and that any strike expected to incidentally damage hospitals \u201cis approved by the highest echelons of command.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur forces on the ground know where these hospitals are, and nodes are taken into account when they're operating,\u201d a legal adviser to the IDF told CNN about the process. \u201cBut at the end of the day, as long as Hamas continues to use these hospitals and facilities for the military operations, and our aim is to defeat Hamas militarily, there is absolutely no choice but to go there.\u201d\n\nInjured Palestinians lie on gurneys in the courtyard of Al-Shifa Hospital, where thousands of displaced people sought shelter, on November 25, 2023. Fadi Alwhidi/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nHospitals and other medical establishments are protected civilian objects under international humanitarian law. It is illegal, with few exceptions, to attack hospitals, ambulances or other health facilities, or to otherwise prevent them from providing care. A hospital can lose its special protected status only if it is used by an armed group for acts that are \u201charmful to the enemy.\u201d But, even if a hospital loses its special status, the wounded and sick inside are still protected by the principle of proportionality. A warning must be given, and time for safe evacuation, before carrying out an attack.\n\n\u201cIn many cases it's impossible to evacuate everyone from a hospital, so there are still medical personnel and patients inside,\u201d Cordula Droege, the chief legal officer of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN. \u201cThe onus is on the attacker... to take all precautions to avoid that they come to harm.\u201d\n\nAl-Quds Hospital\n\nIsrael has repeatedly called for the evacuation of 22 hospitals in northern Gaza. But doctors operating in the hospitals, as well as international organizations, have said the evacuation of injured patients and staff is incredibly dangerous, if not impossible, amid the fighting.\n\nIsrael first ordered Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is run by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to be evacuated on October 14, according to the humanitarian organization. The group, which is affiliated with the ICRC, said that it couldn\u2019t evacuate the hospital\u2019s 500 patients \u2013 particularly those in the ICU and babies in incubators \u2013 nor could it move 12,000 displaced people, many of them women and children, who had sought refuge there.\n\nCNN used a 3D model to reconstruct the attacks on and in the vicinity of Al-Quds Hospital, drawing on verified videos and images from social media, as well as aerial footage shared by the IDF. On October 18, Al-Quds was rattled by airstrikes about 100 meters (328 feet) away. Videos filmed from the hospital showed an explosion lighting up the night sky and a building nearby being struck, as people huddled inside the hospital\u2019s front entrance. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society More strikes were reported near the hospital on October 22. On the same day, Saleem Aburas, a PRCS relief coordinator, shared footage from outside of Al-Quds showing fragments that he said were from \u201coccupation army missiles.\u201d Marc Garlasco, a military adviser at the Dutch organization PAX for Peace and a former UN war crimes investigator, said that it looked like remnants from a military-grade aerial munition, not a Hamas rocket. Palestine Red Crescent Society Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), said the fragments were most likely from \u201chigh explosive projectiles fired from tanks or artillery guns,\u201d which could have been fired from \u201csomething like a main battle tank, but also something like a self-propelled howitzer.\u201d A week later, on October 29, another strike hit several meters away from Al-Quds. Footage from inside showed windows blown out, broken glass and rubble, and people rushing from smoke-filled rooms coughing and covering their mouths. Outside, a cloud of smoke billowed from the site. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society The PRCS said that Israel had warned it to evacuate ahead of the bombardment and alleged it was deliberately striking \u201cnext to Al-Quds\" to force people out. The IDF told CNN that it had issued multiple evacuation warnings. Al-Quds\u2019 director, Dr. Bashar Mourad, said there were no safe routes to flee and that ambulances attempting to move south were targeted with artillery fire. \u201cThe bombings are occurring all around us,\u201d Mourad told CNN. As Israel\u2019s ground forces closed in on Gaza City, explosions around Al-Quds became an almost daily occurrence. On November 2, the PRCS said Israeli military vehicles about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) south of the hospital fired bullets \u201cindiscriminately,\u201d injuring two people standing outside and penetrating the hospital\u2019s sixth floor, sharing a photo of what Garlasco said appeared to be an unexploded mortar embedded in an interior wall. Palestine Red Crescent Society A day later, the PRCS said that at least 21 people were injured at Al-Quds when internal glass walls shattered, and part of the ceiling fell due to Israeli strikes. Blasts were reported nearby on November 4 and 5, with videos showing the aftermath, including a building that was destroyed a couple of blocks away and broken glass inside the ICU. replay with audio Palestine Red Crescent Society The IDF released aerial footage on November 7 showing a strike on a building, which they claimed was a Hamas weapons depot, and that CNN geolocated to just over 100 meters (328 feet) from Al-Quds Hospital. It appeared to be the same block targeted on November 5. Israel Defense Forces CNN reviewed satellite imagery of Al-Quds and the surrounding area throughout October and November. On November 7, when people were still sheltering there, the hospital was surrounded by damaged buildings and large craters. Garlasco said that one large crater to the west of the hospital looked like the result of a precision-guided munition, and was consistent with the aftermath of either a 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or precision artillery used by the IDF.\n\nOn November 10, the PRCS said that one person was killed, and 28 others injured, most of them children, when Israeli forces opened fire at the hospital\u2019s ICU. The group said that continuous shelling had destroyed nearby streets, blocking aid in and evacuations out of the hospital. Amid power outages caused by dwindling fuel, videos showed doctors operating by flashlight.\n\nThe IDF released footage on November 13 that it said showed a group of armed men at the entrance of Al-Quds Hospital, at least one of whom appeared to be carrying a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. Israel said in a statement that its forces killed \u201capproximately 21 terrorists\u201d when they returned fire after the militants shot at their tank from the hospital, adding that civilians were seen leaving the hospital during the exchange.\n\nThe PRCS condemned Israel\u2019s \u201cfalse claims\u201d and said no armed individuals were operating in Al-Quds. A video shared by Aburas, the PRCS relief coordinator, showed an Israeli tank firing on Al-Quds from the same location pictured in the IDF footage. The person filming ducked away from the window and a woman could be heard crying in the background.\n\nreplay with audio An Israeli tank fires towards Al-Quds. Saleem Aburas\n\nAl-Quds Hospital ceased operations on November 13. Soon after, footage showed hundreds of people fleeing to the south on foot, with some being carried on stretchers.\n\nWhen asked about how Israel assesses proportionality when considering whether to attack hospitals, the IDF legal adviser told CNN: \u201cIn our situation, that [proportionality] is almost irrelevant, because, on the whole, we haven't conducted attacks against hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been a very small number of occasions where because there\u2019s been an immediate threat to the life of our soldiers we\u2019ve had to fire at hospitals,\u201d the legal adviser added, referring to Al-Quds.\n\nreplay with audio Hundreds of people evacuate the hospital. Palestine Red Crescent Society\n\nCraig Jones, a lecturer at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom, rejected the notion that proportionality might not be relevant, saying that the rule applies whenever a military objective is the object of an attack. For his book, \u201cThe War Lawyers,\u201d Jones examined the laws of war applied by military lawyers to targeting operations carried out by the IDF in Gaza.\n\n\"They are careful, deliberate calculations that take place behind the scenes. And I think it's a point worth emphasizing that much of the death and destruction that we see, including damage to the hospitals, is known in advance,\u201d Jones told CNN, adding that the damage is a calculated choice, not an inevitability.\n\nTwo months of siege left Al-Quds Hospital surrounded by flattened buildings, satellite imagery showed. Some of the surrounding craters were covered by tracks from armored vehicles.

CNN has added blur to protect the identity of patients. Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAbout 2.6 kilometers (1.6 miles) north of Al-Quds, Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, has emerged as another flashpoint. Israel has said that a Hamas command center sits underneath the medical complex and that the group has used it to hold hostages, repeatedly calling for the hospital to be evacuated. Hamas has denied the claims, as have health officials working there.\n\nIn the first weeks of the war, patient numbers at Al-Shifa surged. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian surgeon who was working at the hospital, told CNN on November 3 that it was operating off only one generator. \u201cUnless there's electricity, this hospital will turn into a mass grave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's as simple as that: If we cannot keep the ventilators running, if we can't take our critically wounded patients back to the operating room, then there's nothing for this place other than to come and die.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, an Israeli airstrike hit a convoy of ambulances, which hospital authorities said were being used to evacuate the wounded, including one outside the entrance of Al-Shifa, killing 15 people and wounding 60 others. Videos from the scene, verified by CNN, showed about a dozen people lying bloodied and motionless. Garlasco, who analyzed the footage, said that cubic fragmentation could be seen on the ambulance door, as well as the clothes of people killed and wounded, which was consistent with aftermath from an Israeli Spike anti-tank guided missile.\n\nThe IDF said it had targeted the ambulance because it was \u201cbeing used by a Hamas terrorist cell,\u201d accusing the group of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances but did not offer evidence. Hamas rejected the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n100 feet 30 meters Intensive Care Unit Ambulance attack Nov. 3 . . Courtyard Nov. 10 . Al-Shifa Hospital Outpatient clinic Nov. 10 .

Satellite imagery from November 7 showed blue and white tarpaulins in the hospital\u2019s courtyard and parking lot where people had set up makeshift shelters. Videos captured crowds of people crammed inside, sleeping in hallways and stairwells. On November 10, just after 1 a.m. a projectile flashed across the sky and crashed into the courtyard. Footage of the aftermath showed a man, his leg maimed, crying out in pain and blood spattered across the concrete. replay with audio Ahmed Hijazi It was the first of several strikes that morning on different parts of the complex, including the hospital\u2019s maternity department and outpatient clinic. Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, director-general of the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, told CNN that there were 15 casualties in the strikes, and that bodies were piling up but could not be buried. Some 400 patients and 20,000 displaced people were still inside the medical facility, he said. The Israeli military claimed a projectile launched by Palestinian militants and aimed at IDF troops operating in the area had hit the hospital. But at least two of the projectiles that struck the site appeared to have been Israeli munitions, according to footage verified by CNN and reviewed by experts. In one of the first videos filmed in the aftermath of the courtyard strike, people could be seen probing a munition remnant that, according to Garlasco, appeared to be an Israeli illumination artillery round. What is an illumination shell? The round is fired, then releases an illuminating canister with a parachute attached, which illuminates target areas at night. Sources: US Army, Saleh Aljafarawi (image) Another video captured a metal fin amid rubble and debris in the maternity department, which was hit a few hours later. Senft told CNN the remnants and structural damage were \u201cconsistent with the tail assembly of several Israeli tank gun projectiles,\u201d but added that without remnants of the warhead it was not possible to determine the type of tank projectile. Garlasco said the tail fins appeared to be from Israeli 120-millimeter high explosive tank shells. The Israeli high explosive tank shell Designed to defeat medium and light armored vehicles and infantry, it has an effective range of over 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). Sources: Elbit Systems, Saleh Aljafarawi (image) Another strike hit the maternity department after 8 a.m., blowing out a large section of the upper floor of the building, which was seen in footage of the aftermath and satellite imagery. replay with audio Saleh Aljafarawi \u201cThe destruction of the outer wall combined with the fragmentation and tail entry hole are all indicative of a 120-millimeter tank round,\u201d Garlasco said. \u201cThese shells have a 4,000-meter range and often over-penetrate in urban areas, meaning it is possible the IDF was engaged with Hamas some distance from the hospital and either missed their targets, or the rounds continued until they hit the hospital.\u201d Around 10 a.m., a projectile hit the outpatient clinic, near the maternity unit. Footage showed a gaping hole in the corrugated metal roof covering an area where displaced people were sheltering, and a man lying motionless on the ground. Garlasco and Senft, the weapons experts, said they could not be definitive about what caused the strike based on the blast hole alone. Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, who was in Al-Shifa at the time, said on November 11 that the hospital\u2019s ICU and pediatric department had also been hit, and that doctors were having to move patients within the complex as strikes continued. replay with audio Patients are moved amid strikes.

Newborn babies taken from incubators and placed together in a bed. Khader Al Za\u2019anoun/CNN Khader Al Za\u2019anoun, a freelance journalist for the Palestinian news agency WAFA, who was embedded at the hospital, sent CNN scores of videos and photos showing the deterioration of the complex. One of the clips captured the aftermath of strikes on the ICU, which was covered in dust and rubble. Holes were visible in the walls that were consistent with the shape left behind by Israeli tank missiles, Garlasco told CNN. Over the next few days, amid pouring rain, Al Za\u2019anoun recorded people at the hospital digging graves in the courtyard, bringing bodies down for burial. In a series of videos, a 10-year-old girl, Sumaiyah Al-Hossary, could be seen following her mother\u2019s body as she was carried outside on a gurney, wrapped in a blue blanket with white flowers and marked with her name in masking tape. Cellphone in hand, Al-Hossary filmed her mother's burial before placing a leaf atop her grave. The same mass grave was observed by a WHO team that led a mission to Al-Shifa a week later. They said they were told more than 80 people were buried there and described the hospital as a \u201cdeath zone.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with CNN on November 12 that there was \"no reason\" patients could not be evacuated from Al-Shifa after the IDF opened an evacuation corridor on the eastern side of the hospital. But doctors said they had refused the IDF\u2019s evacuation orders for fear of what would happen to their 700 at-risk patients.\n\nOn November 15, Israeli tanks surrounded Al-Shifa. Satellite imagery showed large sections to the north and south of the hospital had been bulldozed ahead of the raid. A doctor told CNN the IDF gave them a 30-minute warning before they swarmed the complex. The Palestinian journalist, Al Za\u2019anoun, said Israeli forces had \u201cinvaded the hospital with large numbers of soldiers and military vehicles, including tanks, armored vehicles, troop carriers, and bulldozers,\u201d adding they were preventing anyone from leaving.\n\nThe IDF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the report, but did say that its operation at Al-Shifa involved troops entering from the ground \u201cin order to minimize\u201d interference with medical care, and limit harm to patients or medical personnel.\n\nA senior US intelligence official told CNN that the US had independently corroborated information suggesting that Hamas and other Gaza militants were using Al-Shifa Hospital as a command hub, but added that Hamas members had largely evacuated days before the IDF raid.\n\nDays later, Israeli soldiers were still inside the complex conducting searches and interrogations, and officers said they had found rifles, ammunition and other military equipment inside. \u201cThey are within the hospital now, they are troops, in front of me while I am talking. We can see them checking and searching this part of the hospital,\u201d a senior plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, Dr. Ahmed El Mokhallalati, said, adding that staff were being questioned about Hamas.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, was detained and later arrested along with several other medical staff.\n\nDoctors and other people dig a mass grave in the Al-Shifa Hospital courtyard on November 14, 2023. Khader Al Za\u2019anoun/CNN\n\nOn November 19, the IDF released footage showing a tunnel shaft and an entrance to what it called an \u201cunderground facility,\u201d which it said it would demolish. The IDF also took CNN and other news organizations to show them the shaft on the grounds of Al-Shifa. But the evidence did not establish without a doubt that there was a command center underneath the hospital.\n\nAfter weeks living under siege, civilians who had been trapped inside Al-Shifa finally started to leave, fleeing to the south of Gaza, footage showed. The PRCS said 31 premature babies were successfully evacuated from the hospital to Egypt for medical treatment.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, UN high commissioner for human rights, said that the events at Al-Shifa beggared belief and that while hundreds of people had fled the hospital, \u201cNowhere is safe in Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules of international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out the attacks must be strictly adhered to,\u201d T\u00fcrk said. \u201cFailure to adhere to these rules may constitute war crimes.\u201d",

Many children are believed to be among the victims. The Turkish health ministry said on Wednesday that of the injured, 39 people have been discharged from hospital and 12 are still receiving treatment.\n\nAuthorities have identified 52 of the deceased, Yerlikaya said.\n\nAs the identities of some of the victims emerged, local schools and businesses started to post death notices for students and educational staff. Some were reported to be fifth graders, aged 10 to 11 years old.\n\nAmong those who lost their lives were 14 members of the same family, CNN Turk reported.\n\n\u201cWe are in deep pain,\u201d Yerlikaya told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials said some desperate holiday goers had tried to jump out of windows in order to escape, as flames licked the top floors of the facility. Footage of the aftermath showed wreaths of gray smoke swirling around the charred building.\n\nThe 12-story hotel was built onto a cliff, complicating efforts to extinguish the flames. Emergency crews arrived at the scene at 4:15 a.m. local time \u2013 almost an hour after the fire broke out \u2013 at 3:27 a.m. local time, said Yerlikaya.\n\nTurkey\u2019s government launched an investigation into the fire, and at least 11 people have been detained, including the municipality\u2019s deputy mayor in charge of the fire department, according to Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc.\n\nAlso detained were \u201cthe business owner, the general manager of the company and the hotel manager,\u201d Tunc said.\n\nJustice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X that 11 people have so far been detained as part of the investigation into the blaze, including the municipality\u2019s deputy mayor in charge of the fire department, and the director of the department.\n\nEyewitnesses recalled the scent of burning, with guests\u2019 screams filling the upper floors of the hotel. Others said the hotel\u2019s fire detection service failed to work. A number of videos, some shared on social media and others broadcast by Turkish TV stations, showed flames coming out of the top floors of the hotel. Some people were seen using tied bed sheets to try to escape the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt was so bad. Everybody was jumping out of the windows with the fear of death and people were so ashamed as there were no fire-extinguishers around,\u201d one eyewitness told CNN affiliate CNN Turk.\n\n\u201cWe could not get water to people. Ambulances and fire trucks came really late, and people did not know what to do,\u201d the eyewitness added.\n\nA guest staying on the third floor of the hotel said the alarm failed to sound, the Associated Press reported, citing the IHA news agency.\n\n\u201cMy wife smelled the burning\u2026 We tried to go upstairs but couldn\u2019t, there were flames,\u201d said Atakan Yelkovan. \u201cPeople on the upper floors were screaming.\u201d\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish the fire at the hotel in Kartalkaya. Mert Ozkan/Reuters\n\nThe resort is a popular destination for holiday-makers in the winter, especially during school holidays, which run from January until the first week of February. The timing of the blaze fell in the school holidays, when people from Istanbul and Ankara travel to the Bolu mountains to ski.\n\nThere were around 234 guests staying at the hotel, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency. Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building \u201cin a panic,\u201d Aydin said.\n\nAt least 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site, Aydin\u2019s office said. According to Yerlikaya, authorities mobilized 267 emergency personnel to respond to the blaze. Authorities evacuated other hotels at the resort as a precautionary measure, and guests were housed in hotels around Bolu.\n\nFunerals took place around Turkey on Wednesday following the tragedy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a service in the northwestern province of Bolu, near the scene of the blaze.\n\n\u201cOur hearts and souls are hurting and we are currently trying to fulfill this duty,\u201d an emotional Erdogan said, according to Reuters. \u201cI pray for patience for the entire family and our nation.\u201d\n\nThe leader was seen crying during the service, and helped carry the coffin of one of the victims. The president previously declared Wednesday a day of mourning.",

It will ultimately be handed over to the local antiquities authority for preservation and study.\n\nPolice opened an investigation to determine who discarded the statue and briefly detained a man for questioning who was later released without charge.\n\nAccidental archaeological discoveries are relatively common in Greece, a country renowned for its ancient heritage, and often made during building construction or public works.\n\nIn December, workers installing natural gas pipelines near Athens uncovered a Roman-era statue of Hermes buried upright in a brick-lined pit near the Acropolis.\n\nThessaloniki weeks ago unveiled a trove of antiquities found during the decades-long construction of its metro system, which officially opened in November.\n\nKey finds, including a marble-paved Roman thoroughfare and tens of thousands of artifacts spanning the Greek, Byzantine and Ottoman periods, are now showcased at subway stations.",

Goose noted that the victims\u2019 families were not present to see Rudakubana plead guilty as the prosecution opening was not expected until Tuesday.\n\nRudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the incident, initially refused to speak when asked to confirm his name, as he had at all previous hearings which meant that not guilty pleas had been entered on his behalf in December.\n\nBut, after consulting with his lawyer, he confirmed he wished to change those pleas.\n\nPolice released a mugshot of Axel Rudakubana on Monday January 20, 2025.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWorld leaders have been rushing to get on Donald Trump\u2019s good side since his reelection as US president, arguably none more so than Ukraine.\n\nIn his annual New Year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had \u201cno doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending Putin\u2019s aggression,\u201d in comments that embody his approach to winning over Trump.\n\nJust days later, Zelensky told an American podcaster that Trump won as he was a \u201cmuch stronger\u201d candidate than Kamala Harris, adding, \u201cHe showed that he can do it intellectually and physically.\u201d\n\nZelensky isn\u2019t alone among prominent Ukrainians in trying to butter up Trump. In November, a Ukrainian MP from Zelensky\u2019s party even nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, according to a letter seen by the Kyiv Independent.\n\nSuch tactics have long been favored by foreign powers. Think of how China took Trump to the Forbidden City or the UK government enlisted the royals during his last term in the White House.\n\nNor is this an entirely new approach from Ukraine. In what a 2019 CNN opinion article called a \u201ctextbook suck-up,\u201d Zelensky could be heard hailing Trump as a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d on the notorious call in which the then first-term president urged Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nYears on, the stakes could not be higher for Ukraine. Kyiv enters 2025 on the backfoot in its war against Russia, with Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Russian advances in the east, where they are vastly outnumbered. Its chances of retaking occupied Russian territory anytime soon look increasingly slim.\n\nUnder outgoing President Biden, the US became the single largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine and Kyiv remains keenly aware that it needs to stay on Trump\u2019s side to secure future support.\n\n\u2018Peace through strength\u2019\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Zelensky does not have the luxury to be hostile towards Trump,\u201d Joanna Hosa, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations told CNN.\n\n\u201cHe must at least try to get him on Ukraine\u2019s side in order to secure the best possible outcome for Ukraine, which depends enormously on American support.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed the need to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, suggesting that negotiations could be on the horizon. His envoy\u2019s plan to end the war contains much that will please the Kremlin.\n\nZelensky has said he wants to \u201cwork directly\u201d with the new president and appears more willing to \u2013 or perhaps has no choice but to \u2013 make battlefield concessions.\n\nServicemen fire a D-30 howitzer towards Russian troops at a position in Zaporizhzhia region on January 11. Reuters\n\n\u201cOf course, Ukraine would want to recapture all land it lost. However, after three years of this exhausting war, recapturing all land is nowhere in sight. With a heavy heart, Ukrainians are slowly coming to accept this,\u201d Hosa said.\n\nZelensky has frequently described Trump as strong, an apparent effort to appeal to a president-elect who has made \u201cpeace through strength\u201d a rallying call.\n\n\u201cTrump could be crucial. I think this is the most important thing for us. His qualities are like that. He can be decisive in this war. He can stop Putin,\u201d Zelensky told United News, Ukraine\u2019s wartime TV network, earlier this month.\n\nOrysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, believes Zelensky\u2019s praise can largely be taken as sincere. She told CNN: \u201cI think he genuinely believes that Trump can make bold moves, and this is where this hope comes from, and not only in Zelensky\u2019s mind but in Ukraine more broadly.\u201d\n\nAligning interests\n\nAnother factor is that unlike previous US administrations, Trump fundamentally believes he can have good relations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has long expressed his admiration for Putin while other world leaders have shunned him and has pledged to meet with him \u201cvery quickly\u201d after he takes office.\n\nFor his part, Putin \u2013 who was condemned as a \u201cbutcher\u201d by Biden \u2013 seems open to building ties with Trump. Following Trump\u2019s election win, Putin offered his congratulations, calling him a \u201ccourageous man.\u201d During his year-end news conference in December, he said he was ready to meet with him.\n\nEven if Russia is brought to the negotiating table, there\u2019s reason to believe its word cannot be trusted. As CNN\u2019s chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh points out, Moscow\u2019s previous pledges of peace in Ukraine have been characterized by deception, suggesting any potential ceasefire may be in name only.\n\nLutsevych believes that the Ukrainian government is trying to present Kyiv\u2019s defeat over Moscow as something that would strengthen America\u2019s \u201cpower projection\u201d on the world stage.\n\n\u201cThis is the game; whether Trump will believe this is a viable strategy is another question,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Zelensky has offered other benefits. In October last year, he pitched the idea of swapping out some US forces based in Europe with Ukrainian troops once Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is over. He argued that the wartime experience of Kyiv\u2019s forces could be put to good use, bolstering NATO \u2013 the military alliance which Ukraine has been offered assurances it will join \u2013 and helping to ensure security in Europe, something that is likely to appeal to a US leader who has demanded Europe do more on defense.\n\nDonald Trump meets with Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on September 27, 2024. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n\nZelensky has also appealed to Trump\u2019s business-focused mind. His so-called \u2018Victory Plan,\u2019 unveiled in October last year, includes a significant deal with the US on minerals \u2013 a critical resource Ukraine is rich in.\n\nAccording to a report in the New York Times, the signing of the minerals deal was pushed back twice, with the possible motive of allowing Trump to take credit for it when he takes office.\n\nLutsevych posited that Kyiv would be making a lucrative offer to the US, in economic terms. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that in this \u2018Victory Plan,\u2019 that it includes critical minerals, it includes investments\u2026 [Ukraine is] basically trying to say that it can be profitable for America.\u201d\n\nBut while flattering Trump is a common tactic, his unpredictability means there are few guarantees it will work.\n\nTrump\u2019s welcome by then-British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, back in 2019 did not stop him from firing off a series of angry tweets moments before stepping off his plane, describing London Mayor Sadiq Khan as a \u201cstone cold loser.\u201d He then labeled then-British Prime Minister Theresa May as \u201cfoolish.\u201d\n\nHosa believes there is evidence Zelensky\u2019s approach is paying off, with Trump acknowledging it would take longer than 24 hours to end the conflict \u2013 a claim he made in July 2024 \u2013 in a sign of his shifting attitude.\n\n\u201cHe [Zelensky] faced a choice: flatter Trump or be forced to capitulate to Putin,\u201d Hosa said.\n\n\u201cFlattery is a small price to pay for a better outcome than that.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi movement has released the crew of a cargo ship more than a year after its fighters hijacked the vessel in the Red Sea, as part of its campaign of attacks in support of Hamas in its war against Israel.\n\nThe Galaxy Leader\u2019s 25-strong crew \u2013 17 Filipinos, three Ukrainians, two Bulgarians, two Mexicans and a Romanian \u2013 has been handed to mediators from Oman, the Houthi-owned Al Masirah TV reported Wednesday.\n\nThe freed Filipino seafarers were under the care of the Philippine Embassy in Muscat, Oman and, \u201cwill be reunited with their loved ones in the Philippines very soon,\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe crew\u2019s release comes just days after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, bringing a reprieve to Palestinians in Gaza after 15 months of war. The Houthis had long said they would only wind down their campaign in the Red Sea once Israel halted its offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe crew had been held hostage since November 2023, when armed Houthis \u2013 descending from a helicopter bearing Yemeni and Palestinian flags \u2013 stormed the ship off the coast of Yemen.\n\nThe Houthi attacks forced some of the world\u2019s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through the Red Sea, one of the world\u2019s most important maritime trade routes.\n\nDramatic footage showed the moment the Houthis boarded the Galaxy Leader. Houthi Movement/Handout/Getty Images\n\nArsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization, said the crew\u2019s release was a \u201cprofound relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s breakthrough is a testament to the power of collective diplomacy and dialogue, recognizing that innocent seafarers must not become collateral victims in wider geopolitical tensions,\u201d he said.\n\nHans Grundberg, the United Nations special envoy for Yemen, welcomed the \u201cheartwarming\u201d reports that the Houthis had \u201cput an end to the arbitrary detention\u201d of the ship\u2019s crew for 14 months.\n\nThe Galaxy Leader sails under the flag of the Bahamas and is usually used to transport vehicles worldwide. It was among dozens of vessels targeted by the Houthis during their Red Sea campaign.\n\nEduardo de Vega, a Filipino foreign affairs official overseeing millions of Filipino migrant workers, said in March last year that little could be done to influence the Houthis except the end of hostilities in Gaza.\n\nThe Houthis \u2013 one side of Yemen\u2019s civil war that has raged for more than a decade \u2013 played an outsized role during the past year of conflicts in the Middle East. As well as targeting ships, the Houthis fired a series of missile attacks at Israel.\n\nAlthough most of the attacks were intercepted by Israeli air defense, Israel\u2019s military responded with airstrikes of its own against Houthi targets in Yemen. The United States and United Kingdom, both allies of Israel, also carried out rounds of strikes against the Houthis.",

Palestinian authorities described besieged hospitals and entire neighborhoods cut off from residents. Meanwhile, relief workers raised fears that the devastation wrought by the Israeli campaign in Gaza will be replicated in the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli troops and settlers have killed at least 851 Palestinians in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack, including 173 children. On Tuesday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said nine more people had been killed, ranging in age from 16 to 57 years old. In addition, a 29-year-old man was killed in the town of Ta\u2019nek, in Jenin district, the ministry said. One medic told CNN a four-month-old baby arrived with shrapnel wounds at a Jenin hospital.\n\nAccording to the UN, 2024 was the third-deadliest year for Israelis in the West Bank since data collection began in 2008. The agency recorded the deaths of 34 Israelis \u2013 15 soldiers and 19 civilians. Of those civilians, seven were settlers.\n\nThe official Palestinian news agency WAFA said on Tuesday that Israeli warplanes had struck Jenin and that Israeli forces, including sharpshooters and armored vehicles, were surrounding the city\u2019s refugee camp and stopping ambulances from entering.\n\nMeanwhile Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), one of the militant groups active in Jenin, accused the Palestinian security forces of taking part in the operation by the Israeli military there. PIJ said the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority (PA) \u201conly serves the (Israeli) occupation.\u201d\n\nEfforts by the Palestinian security forces over the last month to dislodge militant elements described as \u201coutlaws\u201d have largely failed.\n\nAn Israeli military vehicle operates during an Israeli raid in Jenin. Ammar Awad/Reuters\n\nMore than 500,000 Jewish settlers live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war and is now home to 3.3 million Palestinians. Jewish settlements there are considered illegal under international law.\n\nKatz said Israel would not allow Iran or any armed groups to threaten Israeli citizens. Israeli officials have previously accused Iran of assisting militant factions in the West Bank, especially in the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nIt comes as a senior Iranian official warned Wednesday that resistance to Israel will remain \u201cas long as repression stays.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s Vice-President for Strategic Affairs, said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest anybody to start rejoicing over destroying Hamas, Hezbollah or the Palestinian resistance, or to cutting Iran\u2019s arms, because the resistance will stay as long as the occupation stays \u2013 as long as repression stays.\u201d\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Wednesday that along with the Israeli Security Agency, known as Shin Bet, and Israel Border Police, it had \u201chit more than 10 terrorists\u201d in the Jenin operation and conducted \u201caerial strikes on terror infrastructure sites,\u201d while \u201cnumerous explosives planted on the routes by the terrorists were dismantled.\u201d\n\nHospital \u2018under complete siege\u2019\n\nThe scale and intensity of the Israeli operation in the West Bank city of Jenin is \u201cby far the hardest and most troubling\u201d in recent months, according to its mayor,\n\nThe Israeli military has sealed off five big residential neighborhoods, Mohammad Jarrar told CNN on Wednesday, adding that the \u201centire camp\u201d has become \u201cimpossible to get into.\u201d\n\nAsked about the mayor\u2019s comments, the Israel Defense Forces told CNN that there had been changes to \u201cprotocols to ensure safe movement and expand inspections\u201d at checkpoints in the West Bank to prepare for the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal.\n\nHowever, it added that it \u201ca closure has not been imposed on cities/villages in Judea and Samaria, and entry and exit are permitted through the open checkpoints,\u201d using the biblical term by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.\n\nIt came after video obtained by CNN showed Israeli military bulldozers digging up a road outside the Jenin government hospital on Tuesday evening, leaving piles of rubble in front of the driveway by morning. The hospital is close to the entrance to the refugee camp.\n\nDr. Wissam Bakr, director of Jenin Hospital, told CNN Wednesday that the facility was \u201cunder complete siege by Israeli military.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo-one can enter or exit the hospital since yesterday.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect on Sunday, with the first six-weeks of the deal ushering in a pause to fighting, the staggered release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and an influx of aid to Gaza. The three-phase ceasefire has raised cautious hopes for an end to the war.\n\nIsraeli bombardment of Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has caused a devastating impact on the territory, with aid agencies warning that damage to critical infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, water and health care facilities, will take years to rebuild.\n\nHere\u2019s a look \u2013 in 6 charts \u2013 at what Gaza is like after 15 months of war.\n\nAn additional 11,000 people remain unaccounted for \u2013 likely either missing or not yet found under rubble, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n\nHowever recent research suggests that the death toll could be far higher than current estimates. A London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) study that was also published in The Lancet journal this month found that the Palestinian health ministry has underreported the death toll by approximately 41%. As of October 2024, the number of Gazans killed by violence was thought to exceed 70,000, according to the study.\n\nMeanwhile, the health ministry said in October that one third of those killed in the first year of the war were children.\n\nIsraeli military strikes have razed most of Gaza to rubble, with Gaza City the most heavily destroyed. Around 436,000 housing units have been destroyed or damaged across the strip, according to the United Nations.\n\nAround 1.9 million Palestinians \u2013 or about 90% of the population \u2013 are internally displaced, according to the UN. Many people in Gaza have been displaced multiple times \u2013 some up to 10 times.\n\nThe Israeli military regularly ordered evacuations from one area of danger to another, according to the UN, who have repeatedly said there \u201cis no safe place in Gaza.\u201d Evacuation orders were issued across 67% of Gaza throughout the course of the war, according to data from the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nThose orders were often airdropped by the Israeli military \u2013 a method Amnesty International said was \u201cnot an effective warning to civilians\u201d \u2013 or posted to social media \u2013 an inaccessible form of communication for many Gazans without power or internet.\n\nThe Israeli military has said that it does all it can to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza, including by sending text messages, making phone calls, and dropping evacuation leaflets to warn civilians ahead of attacks.\n\nAl-Mawasi, a 67 square kilometer (25.9 square miles) area \u2013 roughly the size of Manhattan, has become the main displacement and refuge area for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ordered by the Israeli military to leave their homes. Before the war, there were 9,000 people living there. By July 2024, the population of the camp had swelled to 1.7 million, according to the UN-backed Famine Early Warning Systems Network. In October, the camp\u2019s population was estimated to be 730,000, according to UNICEF.\n\nDespite being designated as a humanitarian zone by Israel, Al-Mawasi has been targeted repeatedly by Israeli airstrikes.\n\nMany people in Gaza have struggled to access food for over a year.\n\nPrior to the war, Gaza was \u201clargely self-sufficient\u201d in fresh produce, according to the UN. Israel\u2019s military operation has damaged or destroyed up to 96% of agricultural assets, including farms and orchards, according to the World Bank. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that it \u201cdoes not intentionally harm agricultural land and seeks to mitigate environmental impact absent operational necessity.\u201d\n\nMost of Gaza is reliant on humanitarian aid, but many aid entry points into Gaza have been closed by Israeli authorities throughout the war.\n\nThat includes the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 and once one of the largest and most important aid crossings into Gaza \u2013 which has been closed since May 2024, when Israel seized control of it. Other aid entry points have been open with extremely limited access.\n\nThe UN said in November that people are \u201ceffectively starving as the conflict rages, with humanitarian organizations blocked from delivering assistance to those in need.\u201d\n\nBefore the war, an average of 500 trucks a day \u2013 around 15,000 trucks a month \u2013 containing aid and commercial goods entered Gaza per month.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on Tuesday that only 2,205 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the month of December, excluding commercial vehicles and fuel.\n\nIsrael disputed that number, saying there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza and that over 5,000 trucks had entered over the course of the month, according to a statement from the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which manages the flow of aid into the strip.\n\nMeanwhile, trucks that do enter Gaza are now facing additional challenges in moving across the territory: Approximately 68% of the road network has been damaged, according to satellite imagery analysis by UNOSAT.\n\nAnd criminal gangs continue to loot convoys carrying food.\n\nGaza\u2019s health care system is in ruins. Prior to October 2023, there were 36 operational hospitals in Gaza. Now, not a single hospital in Gaza is fully functional.\n\nIsrael\u2019s pattern of attacks has \u201cpushed the health care system to the brink of total collapse,\u201d according to a December UN report. To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 654 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza, resulting in 886 fatalities and 1,349 injuries.\n\nThe IDF has said that Hamas fighters embed inside hospitals and store arms in them.\n\nOnly half of Gaza\u2019s hospitals are partially operational, relying solely on aid and fuel deliveries to function.\n\nFuel shortages continue to threaten the care for around 2,000 patients, according to the WHO\u2019s health cluster, around 10% of whom are in intensive care units. Additionally, more than 12,000 patients are estimated to require urgent medical evacuation abroad.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIsrael\u2019s longest war has so far failed to destroy its main enemy, Hamas, which, despite suffering devastating losses, is framing the Gaza ceasefire agreement as a victory for itself \u2013 and a failure for Israel.\n\nSoon after a ceasefire came into effect on Sunday, masked gunmen emerged in vehicles roaming the devastated streets of Gaza in celebration. Members of an elite unit wore their full uniform at Al Saraya Square in Gaza City during the hostage transfer. It was Hamas\u2019 reminder that its armed wing was still here 15 months after Israel set out to destroy them.\n\nOne of Hamas\u2019 main goals for taking some 250 hostages during its brazen October 7, 2023, attack on Israel was to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. As Israel pounded Gaza in response Hamas vowed not to return the hostages until Israel withdrew its forces from the enclave, permanently ended the war, and allowed for rebuilding.\n\nAfter more than a year of fighting, Hamas and Israel in recent days reached a phased agreement that will see the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in addition to a 42-day ceasefire and the entry of aid. The deal also opens the door for further negotiations that could lead to a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire.\n\n\u201c(The agreement) achieves all these conditions\u2026 the resistance has achieved what the Palestinian people want,\u201d Hamas senior political member Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera after a deal was reached.\n\nKhalil Al Hayya, Hamas\u2019 main negotiator, said in a speech on Wednesday that Israel had failed to achieve its war goals and praised Hamas\u2019 armed wing, Al Qassam Brigades, whose spokesman Abu Obaida commended the war in Gaza as an \u201cinspiration\u201d for generations to come. Israel\u2019s main goal of the conflict was to eliminate Hamas.\n\nSome Israeli ministers, lawmakers and even a small minority of hostage families view the acceptance of a deal as an Israeli defeat. Far-right minister Itamar Ben Gvir and his party resigned from the government and Knesset (parliament), calling the truce a \u201csurrender.\u201d Fellow right-winger, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called it \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and a group of army reservists labeled it \u201cThe Surrender Deal.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, convenes his security cabinet to vote on the ceasefire deal on Jan. 17, 2025. Koby Gideon/GPO/AP\n\n\u201cWhen you see \u2026 the dancing in Gaza, the celebrations in villages in Judea and Samaria \u2013 you understand which side surrendered in this deal,\u201d Ben Gvir said in a statement on Thursday. Judea and Samaria is what Israel calls the West Bank.\n\nBut most in Israel are welcoming the agreement, including the majority of the hostage families, Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog and the political opposition. Netanyahu\u2019s office said after the security cabinet approved the deal that the prime minister still \u201csupports the achievement of the objectives of the war.\u201d\n\nA neon sign referring to the Israeli hostages held in Gaza atop the Charles Bronfman Auditorium at HaBima Square in Tel Aviv on December 9, 2023. Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA source familiar with the matter told CNN that Netanyahu told ministers that the US has provided guarantees \u201cthat if Hamas sabotages a certain stage of the deal, Israel can resume fighting.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hamas survival is a defeat for Israel\u2019\n\nIsrael\u2019s response to Hamas for the October 7 attack was intense. It flattened Gaza under the most severe bombardment campaign in the enclave\u2019s history, killing tens of thousands of Palestinians and displacing hundreds of thousands more, many of whom were forced to live in tents with little food and inadequate medical care.\n\nIsrael also inflicted heavy losses on Hamas, killing its top leadership, including the mastermind of the October 7 attack Yahya Sinwar, and claimed to have killed thousands of the group\u2019s fighters. It was relentless in rooting out reemerging militants in previously cleared neighborhoods, all while fighting, and eventually defeating, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah in the north, which had opened a new front against Israel in support of Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas that was once in military and political control of Gaza has been reduced to a fraction of its old self after Israel\u2019s 15-month campaign, and with the significant weakening of its regional allies Hezbollah and Iran, the group has become regionally isolated.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians return to the war-devastated Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip on January 19, 2025, shortly before the ceasefire deal was implemented. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYet the movement has continued to present itself to Palestinians as the most formidable armed resistance group against Israel, replenishing its ranks by recruiting almost as many new militants as it has lost.\n\n\u201cEach time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas militants regroup and re-emerge because there\u2019s nothing else to fill the void,\u201d United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks at the Atlantic Council recently.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.\u201d\n\nTahani Mustafa, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG), argues that the suffering inflicted on Gaza\u2019s Palestinians by Israel\u2019s war creates fertile ground for recruitment.\n\n\u201cYou can see a recruitment surge precisely because when there\u2019s occupation and violence you can find relevance there,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHow can you expect whole hosts of segments of Gaza\u2019s population who have lost everything to simply take it lying down? It\u2019s a war for survival. Groups like Hamas provide (the Palestinians) with the means of doing that.\u201d\n\nIn his comments to the Atlantic Council, Blinken said the US has stressed to the Israeli government \u201cthat Hamas cannot be defeated by a military campaign alone, that without a clear alternative, a post-conflict plan and a credible political rise to the Palestinians, Hamas or something just as abhorrent and dangerous will grow back.\u201d\n\nHamas policemen stand guard in Gaza City, January 20, 2025. Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters\n\nPalestinian Hamas militants stand guard as they prepare to hand over hostages in Gaza City, January 19, 2025. Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters\n\nHamas pledges to rebuild\n\nThe governance of post-war Gaza remains unaddressed, possibly due to skepticism over whether the ceasefire agreement will progress beyond the initial phase. Israel\u2019s ultimate war goal is the complete destruction of Hamas. But Hamas appears unconcerned, suggesting that its cadres will play a role in rebuilding the devastated enclave. \u201cThe whole population, and the resistance as part of it, will begin rebuilding what the occupation has destroyed,\u201d Hamas\u2019 Hamdan told Al Jazeera.\n\nHamdan maintained that regardless of the outcome, the day after for Gaza will remain similar to the day before.\n\n\u201cThe day after, is like today, is like the day before\u2026it will be a Palestinian day,\u201d Hamdan said.\n\nMembers of the International Committee of the Red Cross speak with fighters of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, in Saraya Square in western Gaza City on January 19, 2025. Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhile Hamas may be claiming victory, it has failed to force Israel to lift the crippling siege on Gaza and has presided over Israeli strikes that killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and made Gaza unlivable. The October 7 attack, and the war it triggered, have had a ripple effect, significantly altering the regional balance of power and fundamentally reshaping the region.\n\nHamas doesn\u2019t see its survival as a goal in this war, but for Israel, the group\u2019s very survival can be considered a \u201cdefeat,\u201d the ICG\u2019s Mustafa said.",

This image was blurred at source. Israel Defense Forces\n\nA representative of Gonen\u2019s family told CNN on Monday that the bag she received held the certificate, a necklace and photos \u2013 and said that Israel\u2019s Internal Security Agency (the Shin Bet) had confiscated the materials.\n\nThey would not go into detail about the photo, but Israeli media reports that the photos depicted the women\u2019s time in captivity.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback \u2018Where\u2019s my mum?\u2019: Israeli hostages held by Hamas reunited with their mothers in emotional video 00:51 - Source: CNN \u2018Where\u2019s my mum?\u2019: Israeli hostages held by Hamas reunited with their mothers in emotional video 00:51\n\nDuring the handover, a Red Cross representative was asked to sign an Arabic-language document. \u201cAcknowledgment of Receipt of Israeli Prisoners,\u201d the document read. \u201cI, the representative of the International Red Cross, acknowledge that I have received from the Izz Eddin al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, a total of three prisoners, who are\u2026\u201d and then the names of the hostages.\n\nA militant presents a \"handover certificate\" to the Red Cross, as seen in a Hamas video.

Hamas\n\nAfter 471 days in forced captivity, the idea that a hostage would receive a gift bag is undoubtedly bizarre.\n\nAt its core is an attempt by Hamas to present itself as an undefeated, serious governing body. Fifteen months after staging its audacious, devastating attack on Israel in October 2023, Hamas knew this would be a big moment for the militant group.\n\nThe message was clear, to Israelis, to Gazans, and to those watching around the world: We are a legitimate governing body, still in charge, who have serious and legal protocols \u2013 even if they pertain to Israeli civilians taken by force from their homes.\n\nIt was on display, too, in Gaza City\u2019s Al Saraya Junction. A row of Qassam militants lined the street \u2013 a message to the Israeli public, whose government has pledged to destroy the group.\n\nThe gathering of a few dozen militants in Gaza City is hardly proof of a serious military threat.\n\nBut the images will fuel both the extremist right-wing in Israel, who believe the ceasefire is a capitulation, and those who favor dialogue, who will argue that if 15 months of unrelenting war failed to dislodge Hamas, further bloodshed is folly.\n\nMilitants from Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, escort a Red Cross vehicle to collect Israeli hostages in Gaza City on Sunday.

                "category": "entertainment",
                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Innocent James completed his chores after school, he would light a kerosene lamp and lay down to read his books. There was no electricity in James\u2019 part of Arusha, a region in northern Tanzania, and so his family was forced to burn expensive oil for him to learn after dark.\n\nToday, James is 33, and many parents in rural Tanzania \u2013 where all year round the sun sets at around 7pm \u2013 must still choose between saving money and allowing their children to read at night. But now, James\u2019 company, Soma Bags, is providing a solution: backpacks equipped with solar panels that charge a reading light.\n\nWhat started as a small-scale project with some discarded cement bags, a sewing machine, and a solar panel, has become a business attracting charities and fashion brands from around the world. Last year, Soma Bags (\u201cReading Bags\u201d in Swahili) sold 36,000 solar backpacks to people across Africa, providing an invaluable energy source for when the sun goes down.\n\nAffordable light for rural households\n\nJames was brought up by his mother and grandmother, both schoolteachers, to love reading.\n\nAt university in Mwanza, James was shocked at the number of schoolchildren he noticed on the street skipping class to ask for money, largely to spend in local video game caf\u00e9s. He wanted to help them find the taste for learning that he remembered from his childhood.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated,\u201d James said, \u201cI could see that the problem was much, much bigger than I thought.\u201d\n\nBefore his last semester, James dropped out of university and used the last of his tuition money to buy a mobile library cart. He began visiting schools, attracting hundreds of children to his reading clubs.\n\nInnocent James started making solar backpacks when he realized that children in his reading clubs could not read after dark. UNDP Tanzania/KumiMedia\n\nBut for all his hard work, there was a problem: children would borrow books from him and then return them unread. James soon realized that while they were eager to read, they could not afford to do so.\n\nFewer than half of households in mainland Tanzania are connected to electricity. This falls to just over a third in rural areas. Consequently, many families rely on kerosene lamps to provide light after dark.\n\n\n\nThese lamps produce dim light and are expensive to fill. They also pollute the air and carry the risk of burns. Parents often opt to send their children to bed, James explained, rather than allowing them to use the lamp to read.\n\nJames\u2019 solution \u2013 flexible solar panels sewn onto the outside of bags to power a reading light \u2013 was inspired by a university professor who carried around a solar charger for his phone, sewn into a fabric pouch. \u201cIt gave me the confidence that what I want is going to work,\u201d said James.\n\nHe started in 2016 by handmaking 80 backpacks per month, sewing on a solar panel sourced from China that charged during the children\u2019s walk to and from school. By the time they returned home, they would have enough power for a reading light. A fully charged bag can power a light for six to eight hours, meaning that one day of bright weather can allow for multiple nights of reading, even if cloudy weather arrives.\n\nJames says the solar backpacks are more affordable than using an oil lamp. A solar bag costs between 12,000 and 22,500 Tanzanian shillings (approximately $4-8), with the reading light included \u2013 the same price as 12-22.5 days of using a kerosene lamp, according to an average cost estimated in a survey of Soma Bags customers.\n\nBuilding the business\n\nSold mainly from his growing franchise of mobile library carts, the bags became popular, and James increased production. He founded Soma Bags in 2019 and oversaw the construction of his own factory in the village of Bulale, in the Mwanza region, in 2020. The company now employs 65 staff.\n\nMade from repurposed cement bags found on the streets of Mwanza, where James lives, the backpack material is durable, lightweight, zero waste, and comes at no cost. The backpacks look good, too \u2013 in the middle of the bags, the white silhouette of a giraffe appears within bright yellow or green stripes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s innovative,\u201d said Joseph Manirakiza, of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which has supported Soma Bags since 2023. \u201cI never thought someone would think of turning waste cement bags into something useful.\u201d\n\nSoma Bags manufactures its products in a purpose-built factory in the village of Bulale, in the Mwanza region. UNDP Tanzania/KumiMedia\n\nJames\u2019 customers are, in the main, families and schools in rural Tanzania \u2013 people and institutions with whom he is familiar from his library cart days. But the company is expanding; over 200 charities have bought bags from James to distribute amongst children in need, and Soma Bags is becoming increasingly popular in urban areas.\n\nWhile inside Soma\u2019s smaller backpacks are battery-powered reading lights, its bigger bags now have in-built charging systems with a greater capacity, enabling them to power other electronic devices, like phone chargers.\n\nThe company has also branched out into travel, sports, and cosmetic bags that aren\u2019t solar-powered. James has sold backpacks to charities in Nigeria, Rwanda, Madagascar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and to fashion brands in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Kenya.\n\nA growing industry\n\nAround 600 million Africans do not have access to electricity. Companies that produce solar-powered lamps are abundant on the continent, and the UN\u2019s Solar Light Distribution Programme is part of a global effort to light up rural areas with affordable and sustainable energy.\n\nThe hybrid social enterprise Smart Girls Uganda has produced and distributed over 12,000 of its own solar bags to children in Africa. \u201cIt is important for multiple companies to produce solar-powered bags across the continent,\u201d said its CEO, Jamila Mayanja. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just lighting; it\u2019s about giving them control over their education, their future, and ultimately helping to break the cycle of poverty in their communities.\u201d\n\nAfter dark, children can continue to read using clean solar energy, rather than expensive and polluting kerosene lamps. UNDP Tanzania/KumiMedia\n\nSoma Bags has been recognized by numerous awards and institutions, including the UNDP and the British government.\n\n\u201cThere is a crop of young people [in Tanzania] who are coming up, and they have realized that they have to take the future into their own hands,\u201d said Manirakiza. \u201cInnocent represents a group of young people using their talent to do something meaningful.\u201d\n\nAs his company continues to expand, James is becoming increasingly busy, but he still finds time to run reading groups for children from his mobile cart twice a week. Now, kids arrive for his readings with his bags on their backs.\n\n\u201cSometimes I see a kid with the bag, and I\u2019m like, wow,\u201d said James, smiling, \u201cI can\u2019t really believe it.\u201d",

And we intend to develop this cooperation further,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov ahead of the meeting.\n\nDecades of conflict in CAR mirror the instability in other fragile African states where reliance on Russia\u2019s military offerings has become increasingly prevalent, amid an aggressive push by Moscow to lessen Western influence on the continent.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s foothold in Africa expands \u2013 notably in the mineral-rich Sahel region that is beset by recurring coups, armed rebellion and extremist insurgency \u2013 anti-Western sentiments, partly fueled by Russian propaganda, are engineering the exit of Western troops from swathes of territory. The Kremlin is the most favored to fill the vacuum they leave.\n\nHolding placards with pro russian slogans, demonstrators gather in Bangui on March 5, 2022 during a rally in support of Russia. Carol Valade/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIvory Coast and Chad are the latest in a string of former French colonies in West and Central Africa to demand the withdrawal of French and other Western forces from their territories, treading in the path of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Those three, all now controlled by juntas, have since turned to Russia for security support, ignoring calls from their Western ex-partners for a swift return to civilian rule.\n\nSupporters of Burkina Faso's junta leader Ibrahim Traore hold national flags of Burkina Faso and Russia during a demonstration in Ouagadougou on October 6, 2022. Issouf Sanogo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMoscow is also a sought-after partner by non-French former colonies such as Equatorial Guinea, which hosts an estimated 200 military instructors deployed by Russia in November to protect the Central African nation\u2019s presidency. Its authoritarian leader President Teodoro Obiang, 82, has ruled the tiny, oil-rich country for 45 years following a coup in 1979.\n\nOutside West and Central Africa, Russia is bolstering its presence in the continent\u2019s north, where Wagner forces back eastern Libya\u2019s de facto ruler, Gen. Khalifa Haftar.\n\nFollowing Assad\u2019s ouster as Syrian leader last month, Moscow has operated multiple flights to and from an airbase in eastern Libya \u2014 some headed to Mali, CNN found \u2014 suggesting a shift from the Syrian bases that have served as a hub for its military operations in Africa and the Mediterranean region.\n\nStatues honor Wagner figures in CAR\n\nIn CAR, an erstwhile French colony, the Russian mercenaries that have operated in the country since 2018 have become the dominant force, following the final exit of French troops in 2022.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting with Putin, Touad\u00e9ra thanked the Russian leader for supporting his nation and helping it to achieve stability.\n\n\u201cToday, the army trained by Russian instructors is capable of repelling terrorists and anyone who encroaches on the territory of CAR. We will continue to work together to strengthen security throughout the country, at the borders, wherever the threat comes from. Russian instructors are truly professionals,\u201d he said.\n\nThe French \u2014 who deployed to CAR to help stabilize the nation after a coup in 2013 sparked a civil war \u2014 retreated over what the armed forces ministry said was CAR\u2019s failure to halt \u201cmassive disinformation campaigns\u201d targeting France amid a competition with Russia for influence.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron last week slammed African leaders for showing \u201cingratitude\u201d over the deployment of his nation\u2019s troops in the Sahel, saying that Sahel states only remained sovereign because of the arrival of French forces.\n\nMacron also dismissed the notion that French troops had been expelled from the region, adding that France was only \u201creorganizing itself\u201d on the continent. \u201cWe left because there were coups d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2026 France no longer had a place there because we are not the auxiliaries of putschists.\u201d\n\nA US State Department report published last February outlined how Kremlin-funded disinformation had taken root across Africa with the creation of a pro-Russia news agency called the \u201cAfrican Initiative\u201d \u2014 which, with the help of hired local journalists, markets Moscow to the continent while tarnishing the West\u2019s reputation.\n\nCAR\u2019s army, bolstered by Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries, United Nations forces and Rwandan troops, has battled to keep armed groups such as the CPC-F at bay and reclaim territory seized by rebels. But it is the Russians who are widely credited with helping the nation stave off collapse.\n\nStatues honoring the late Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and top commander, Dmitry Utkin, were unveiled in CAR\u2019s capital, Bangui, in December, a Telegram channel linked to the mercenary group reported. Both men were killed in a plane crash northwest of Moscow in August 2023, two months after they had launched an abortive rebellion against Russia\u2019s military leadership.\n\nA photograph from December 3, 2024, shows a newly inaugurated bronze statue in the likeness of late Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin (left), and his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin, erected in Bangui. Annelo Niamolo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWagner, rebranded as the Africa Corps and placed under the umbrella of the Russian defense ministry after Prigozhin\u2019s death, still operates under the Wagner brand in CAR, where its mercenaries are possibly the group\u2019s most active in Africa.\n\nCAR\u2019s communications minister, Maxime Balalou, told CNN the statues were \u201cinaugurated as part of the cooperation between our country and Russia,\u201d adding that a bilateral defense agreement \u201callowed Russia to provide us with weapons\u201d as well as \u201chandling and training for our defense and security forces, (and) assisting our armed forces on the ground.\u201d\n\nAnother monument, depicting Wagner troops guarding a local woman and her children, was erected in Bangui three years ago.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s significant contribution helped stabilize and secure CAR,\u201d Balalou said, adding that \u201cat the height of CAR\u2019s crisis, we were abandoned\u2026 but Russia responded.\u201d\n\nProtection \u2013 at what cost?\n\nNot everyone views Russia\u2019s involvement in Africa through a positive lens.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s guns-for-hire mission is far from humanitarian, according to Irina Filatova, a Russian historian specializing in African history. It\u2019s a mixed quest for power and cash, she said, as Moscow hunts for alternative revenue to sustain its war in Ukraine amid a raft of Western sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are providing this support (to troubled African nations) in exchange for either the full control or a percentage of the control from their mineral resources. That is what Russia needs: It needs funding, and it needs influence. It helps its war in Ukraine,\u201d Filatova, a senior research associate at the University of Cape Town, told CNN from South Africa.\n\nIn CAR, Martin Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9, a former prime minister and current opposition MP, told CNN that Wagner\u2019s remuneration for providing military services to his nation \u201cis done in an extremely hidden and discreet manner\u201d by the Touad\u00e9ra-led government.\n\nCentral African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera. Richard Bord/Getty Images\n\nPrevious CNN investigations found that companies linked to ex-Wagner leader Prigozhin had won concessions to mine gold and diamonds in CAR, where nearly 70% of the population lives in extreme poverty \u2014 the fifth highest poverty rate in the world, according to a World Bank assessment in 2023.\n\nOne of those companies owns rights to the Ndassima gold mine, located 440 kilometers (273 miles) east of Bangui, whose gold proceeds are valued at over $1 billion, according to the US Treasury Department.\n\n\u201cAuthorities have no right of inspection,\u201d Jean-Fernand Koena, who heads a union of CAR\u2019s journalists, told CNN about what he said was Wagner\u2019s total control of the Ndassima mine.\n\nCAR\u2019s government, he said, cannot monitor \u201cwhere the gold that they (Prigozhin-linked company) mine goes,\u201d adding that there is \u201cneither public accounting nor information from the ministry of mines.\u201d\n\nCNN has contacted the mines ministry for comment.\n\nThe US Treasury Department said in a statement announcing sanctions in June 2023 that the company, Midas Ressources, had \u201cin conjunction with the Wagner Group\u201d denied \u201cCAR government officials the ability to inspect the Ndassima mine.\u201d\n\nThe same statement said another company affiliated with Prigozhin, named as Diamville, had \u201cshipped diamonds mined in the CAR to buyers in the UAE and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury further reported that in 2022 (the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine), two companies \u2013 Diamville and Industrial Resources \u2013 took part in a gold-selling scheme to convert CAR-origin gold into US dollars and that the latter knowingly \u201cparticipated in the transfer by hand of cash to Russia\u201d \u2014 in a bid to bypass US sanctions on Russian financial institutions.\n\n\u2018Win-win cooperation\u2019\n\nA report by the World Gold Council, an international association of gold producers, puts Wagner\u2019s earnings from its illicit gold dealings at an estimated $2.5 billion since the start of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis includes the profits from mines and refineries under Russian control, as well as retainers for security services, in CAR, Sudan and Mali,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn 2022, CNN also investigated Russia\u2019s plunder of Sudan\u2019s gold, uncovering more than a dozen Russian gold-smuggling flights out of the war-torn country in exchange for backing its military leadership.\n\nThe following year, CNN uncovered evidence that Wagner had been arming a Sudanese militia group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is engaged in a bitter war with Sudan\u2019s armed forces for control of the country. Both Prigozhin and the RSF denied this at the time.\n\nFor CAR, the murky underbelly of its military partnership with Russia also comes \u201cat the cost of serious violations of human rights,\u201d Koena said.\n\nWagner\u2019s alleged atrocities in Africa are widely reported. In CAR, its forces were found to have \u201csummarily executed, tortured, and beaten civilians\u201d since 2019, according to a 2022 report by the rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\nBalalou, the communications minister, did not address these allegations but told CNN: \u201cWe are developing a new form of win-win cooperation with Russia.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify what this entailed.\n\nVladislav Ilin, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in CAR, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOutside CAR, similar atrocities, including the killing of civilians, have been committed by Wagner, the HRW claimed in another report last year, this time uncovering the group\u2019s alleged deadly activities in Mali, where it partners with the West African nation\u2019s military to fight insurgents.\n\nThis undated photograph handed out by French military shows Russian mercenaries boarding a helicopter in northern Mali. French Army/AP\n\nWagner has suffered some of its worst losses on the continent in Mali.\n\nIn response to a question from CNN about the nature and scope of Russia\u2019s military partnerships on the continent, the Kremlin\u2019s Peskov said: \u201cWe are purposefully developing our cooperation with African countries, including interaction in sensitive areas related to security.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the widespread allegations of abuse and misconduct attributed to Wagner forces in CAR and Mali.\n\nCompetition for influence\n\nThe Kremlin isn\u2019t the only foreign power jostling for influence in Africa.\n\nWith the US largely focused on the Middle East, China has made deep inroads into the continent over decades, expanding military ties and claiming the title of Africa\u2019s top trading partner for the past 15 years, according to Beijing.\n\nChina has also financed tens of billions worth of development projects across Africa, including under its flagship Belt and Road global infrastructure drive launched in 2013.\n\nProjects under the initiative\u2019s umbrella have generated accusations of lax environmental and labor standards, as well as risky lending, with critics saying China has saddled low- and middle-income governments with overly high levels of debt relative to their GDPs. Beijing has sought to push back on Western criticism over those debts.\n\nMutasim Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, a Canadian NGO, told CNN that in his view, Russia and China tend to share a common trait in their dealings with Africa.\n\n\u201cRussians and Chinese do not care about democracy, human rights violations, corruption, and the like\u2026 They\u2019re happy to protect dictators and human rights violators. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Russians are getting a lot more influence,\u201d he said, contrasting their approach with Western powers such as the US and France, who prioritize democracy and human rights protections.\n\nA report by the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies in 2022 highlighted concerns over abusive labor practices, unsafe working conditions and lack of transparency among Chinese-owned companies operating in southern Africa.\n\nThe Chinese Mission to the African Union has not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the claim China does not prioritize democracy and human rights protections in its dealings with African states.\n\nChina and Russia were the main arms suppliers to sub-Saharan Africa between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nAddressing African delegates at a summit in Beijing in September, President Xi Jinping claimed ties between Beijing and Africa were their \u201cbest in history,\u201d as he pledged billions of dollars in financial support for the continent, in addition to $140 million in military aid.\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry statement issued after the summit said Beijing was committed to building a \u201cshared future\u201d with Africa and that \u201cChina will continue to respect African countries\u2019 political and economic choices based on their own national conditions and honor the principles of noninterference in African countries\u2019 internal affairs.\u201d\n\nIn Koena\u2019s view, China\u2019s policy of non-interference speaks to how different powers operate in Africa, with China focusing on economics and Russia on security.\n\n\u201cIn a renewed resentment against Western policy in Africa, China is imposing itself on the economic level through trade and infrastructure while Russia wants to be the military response for the stability of sometimes autocratic regimes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Koena\u2019s country, CAR, which has experienced decades of instability, \u201cthe message of peace and security gets across more quickly than the economy,\u201d he added. For as long as this continues, the Russian military presence will likely be welcomed by its leaders.\n\nCNN\u2019s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s government is facing criticism for its clampdown on illegal mining that cut off food and water to hundreds of miners underground, after at least 78 bodies were pulled from a shaft this week.\n\nRescuers worked for a third day in search of survivors Wednesday, after a court ordered their rescue. A police spokesperson said Wednesday afternoon that at least 166 people had been rescued alive from the abandoned shaft. More than 100 others are believed to have died from starvation and dehydration while underground.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) described the deaths at the Stilfontein mine, located around 97 miles (156 kilometers) southwest of Johannesburg, as an \u201cunfolding massacre.\u201d\n\nThe union said in a statement that the miners, \u201cmany of them undocumented and desperate workers from Mozambique and other Southern African countries, were left to die in one of the most horrific displays of state willful negligence in recent history.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s handling of the situation was also called out by the Democratic Alliance (DA), which formed a coalition with the ruling ANC party last year. The DA questioned \u201cwhy the situation was allowed to get so badly out of hand\u201d while calling for investigations into what transpired at the mine.\n\n\u201cA government without humanity\u201d\n\nA video filmed by one of the miners last week showed multiple bodies wrapped in plastic in the mine. The video also showed shirtless, emaciated-looking men with protruding bones and ribs.\n\nSAFTU said survivors who emerged from the mine resembled \u201cwalking ghosts after enduring weeks without food or water\u201d and accused the government of acting \u201cwithout humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that the South African government allowed this situation to deteriorate to such an extent. While it is true that these miners were engaged in illegal mining activities, driven by desperation and extreme poverty, their actions do not justify condemnation to death by starvation,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said.\n\nPolice spokesperson Athlenda Mathe told reporters in November that vital supplies to those underground had been halted in a bid to force them out and put an end to illegal mining in the country, despite SAFTU\u2019s warnings that the hardline gamble could \u201cend in a tragedy.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa loses more than a $1 billion to illegal mining every year and has vowed a crackdown of the trade. There are an estimated 100,000 artisanal miners in the country, known locally as \u201czama zamas,\u201d with violent turf wars often linked to the black market trade in gold.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMore than 32,000 people have fled to towns in northeast Colombia as they attempt to escape a sharp rise in fighting between militant factions, according to the country\u2019s ombudsman.\n\nIris Mar\u00edn said the violence escalated last week in the Catatumbo region, displacing tens of thousands of people. Hundreds more remain confined to their homes and are unable to evacuate due to the ferocity of the clashes, Mar\u00edn warned Tuesday in a video statement.\n\nColombian authorities say 80 people have been killed in the fighting.\n\nAlmost half of those displaced have flocked to the city of C\u00facuta near the Venezuelan border. Officials there have launched a major campaign to shelter the more than 15,000 people who have arrived in recent days.\n\nIn C\u00facuta, the city\u2019s football stadium has been turned into a large welcome center, with thousands of displaced victims lining up to receive food, water and clothing from locals.\n\nMany are also sheltering in hotels and the homes of relatives, C\u00facuta Mayor Jorge Acevedo said, pledging to support those in need.\n\n\u201cWe are going to address the emergency that is occurring. Total solidarity, respect, affection and love for these human beings who are arriving in the city of C\u00facuta,\u201d Acevedo said.\n\nViolence in strategic drug production territory\n\nThe humanitarian crisis is a direct result of increased clashes between the National Liberation Army \u2013 ELN \u2013 and spin-off groups of the disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.\n\nBoth factions were founded around the 1960s and \u201870s as left-wing guerrilla groups, but are now mostly involved in drug trafficking and other criminal activities, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, Colombia senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nPeople displaced by violence in towns across the Catatumbo region line up to register for shelter at a stadium in C\u00facuta, Colombia, Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025. Fernando Vergara/AP\n\nThe Catatumbo region in northeastern Colombia, where the crisis originated, is a strategic territory for both drug production and trafficking due to its proximity with Venezuela. The region has seen some of the highest levels of violence in modern Colombian history.\n\nIn response to the violence, Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro has suspended peace talks with the ELN, whose actions he described as criminal. On Monday, he said he would declare a state of internal unrest, but that decree has yet to be published or signed.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office on Wednesday reactivated arrest warrants for 31 ELN members who were involved in peace negotiations. The judicial body said the move was due to \u201cthe evidence and the seriousness of the criminal acts\u201d in the Catatumbo region.\n\nThe arrest warrants had been suspended since 2022, when Petro restarted the peace process with that armed group.\n\nSome have criticized Petro\u2019s \u201ctotal peace\u201d initiative which has attempted to reduce violence partly through negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe crisis in Catatumbo should be a wake-up call for the Petro administration. Its \u2018total peace\u2019, coupled with the lack of effective security and justice policies, have allowed armed groups to expand their presence and brutal control over remote communities across Colombia,\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Colombian foreign ministry for comment.\n\nEvacuation efforts\n\nThe Colombian cities of Oca\u00f1a and Tib\u00fa have also received 11,503 and 5,300 displaced people respectively, Colombia\u2019s ombudsman Mar\u00edn said Tuesday.\n\nOther victims have fled to neighboring Venezuela, a country that in recent years has seen far more people leaving its borders than entering due to spiraling economic and political insecurity.\n\nVenezuelan Foreign Minister Yv\u00e1n Gil said the country has implemented a humanitarian operation to help Colombian families that have arrived in the municipality of Jesus Maria Sempr\u00fan near the border in recent days.\n\nColombia\u2019s defense ministry said more than 400 evacuations have been carried out in the Catatumbo region since the uptick in fighting last week, while more than 5,000 soldiers and special forces unit have been deployed to C\u00facuta.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPope Francis is taking the highly unusual decision to dissolve an influential Catholic group from Peru which has been plagued by allegations of abuse from within its community, including allegations related to its founder, for more than a decade.\n\nNews of the decision to dissolve the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which at one point had 20,000 members across South America and parts of the United States, was confirmed in a statement by the group, although the Vatican has yet to comment or publish anything official about the move.\n\nThe decision to suppress the Sodalitium was first reported by Spanish-language site Infovaticana with the Sodalitum saying the \u201ccentral information\u201d in that report was true but that \u201cit contained several inaccuracies,\u201d although it did not specify what these were.\n\nFigari has denied all the allegations against him. CNN has contacted his attorney for comment. CNN has also contacted the Vatican for comment.\n\nA papal decision to dissolve or suppress a Catholic religious community is rare and in the Sodalitium\u2019s case follows attempts by the church hierarchy to reform the group and a 2023 Vatican investigation which uncovered \u201csadistic\u201d abuses of power, authority and spirituality. Its founder, Luis Fernando Figari, had earlier been found to allegedly committed sexual acts with recruits along with accusations of serious financial mismanagement, according to a 2017 outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium.\n\nAfter the Vatican probe carried out by Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu, Figari was expelled from the order by the pope in August 2024 and a month later the pope expelled 10 more of its leading members. One of those expelled was found to have carried out \u201cabuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism,\u201d an unusual charge.\n\nThe Sodalitium, in a January 21 communique, said they had so far paid in excess of $5 million in damages to victims of abuse. \u201cWith this report, the members of the Sodalitium, feeling deep sorrow and shame for the harm caused to specific individuals and their families, reiterate our request for forgiveness to all those who have suffered because of these actions,\u201d it wrote.\n\nA victim of Figari told CNN last year that he was abused at least three times in the 1970s at the age of 17 with him and other victims looking to the Vatican investigation and papal response to bring a measure of justice.\n\nBut the victims have waited years for church authorities to act, with victims lodging complaints with the Archdiocese of Lima in 2011 and reportedly even earlier. A turning point came with a 2015 book, \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d written by one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, and journalist Paola Ugaz.\n\nUgaz told CNN she believed the pope\u2019s decision is \u201cunprecedented\u201d as it is the first time that \u201ca Catholic organization that abused its members and committed economic misconduct\u201d has been suppressed. Her journalism, she said, had led to a \u201ctsunami of persecution that the Sodalitium directed against me for seven years\u201d and that she owed \u201cinvaluable gratitude\u201d to the pope.\n\nFounded in 1971 in Peru as a lay group (a \u201cSociety of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right\u201d), the Sodalitium exercised huge influence as it sought to recruit mostly young white boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links.\n\nIt was also politically driven as a fight back against the rise of liberation theology in Latin America, a radical movement which began in the 1960s and focussed on supporting the poor.\n\nSalinas told CNN last year that the group\u2019s thinking mixed \u201cthe Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d while the 2017 investigation described Figari as \u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist, and obsessed with sexual issues.\u201d That report also found that sexual, physical and psychological abuse took place in the order.",

His action requires agencies to assess whether stricter US trade policy could successfully restrict the flow of fentanyl and the flow of undocumented migrants into the United States.\n\n\u201cWhile less than 1% of fentanyl and illegal immigrants that enter the United States come from Canada, our government has already acted to address the concerns raised by the president about border security with an over $1 billion comprehensive border plan,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cWe\u2019re already working collaboratively to keep our citizens safe on both sides of the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanadian energy powers American manufacturing, businesses, and homes. Of America\u2019s top five trading partners, Canada is the only one with whom the United States runs a trade surplus in manufacturing, and Canada buys more goods made by Americans than China, Japan and Germany combined,\u201d he said.\n\nTrudeau remarked that Trump\u2019s stated US \u201cgolden age\u201d would require more steel, aluminum, minerals and reliable and affordable energy. \u201cCanada has all those resources, and we stand at the ready to work with the United States to create a booming and secure North American economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe alternative for them would be more resources from Russia, China, or Venezuela.

Collectively, they accounted for 30% of the value of all the goods the US imported last year, according to federal trade data.\n\nWhile Trump claims foreign exporters pay the tariffs, US consumers stand to foot a portion of the bill, too, as retailers are unlikely to fully absorb the added costs.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBorn from \u201cgunboat diplomacy,\u201d the Panama Canal is under threat from US saber rattling once again.\n\nMore than 100 years after the construction of the engineering marvel that linked the Atlantic and Pacific oceans \u2013 and 25 years after the canal was returned to Panama by the US \u2013 the waterway faces renewed intimidation from an American president.\n\nUS President Donald Trump in his inaugural address on Monday vowed to wrest the canal back. \u201cWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama\u2019s promise to us been broken,\u201d Trump said, claiming that Panama overcharges the US Navy to transit the canal.\n\n\u201cAbove all China is operating the Panama Canal,\u201d Trump also said, a frequent claim he has made without providing any evidence. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we are taking it back!\u201d\n\nPanamanian officials have scoffed at Trump\u2019s latest claims that the country charges too much for ships to transit the canal or that China secretly has taken control of the waterway.\n\nStill, his threats are not taken idly by Panamanians who consider the canal to be central to their national identity and depend on lucrative canal traffic. In 2024, the canal earned nearly $5 billion in total profits. According to a study released in December by IDB Invest, 23.6% of Panama\u2019s annual income is generated from the canal and companies that provide services related to the canal\u2019s operations.\n\nPanama has also experienced several US military interventions over the years.\n\n\u201cAll he [Trump] needs is to land ten thousand troops and that\u2019s it,\u201d said Ovidio Diaz-Espino, who was born in Panama and is the author of \u201cHow Wall Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Panama Canal.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have an army.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks during inauguration ceremonies in the Rotunda of the US Capitol on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHow the US imposed a canal on Panama in the first place\n\nIn 1903, Panama was a restive department of Colombia, with many Panamanians advocating openly for independence from a central government on the other side of the impassable Darien Gap jungle that they felt neglected them. Colombia, though, had little interest in letting go of the strategically located territory.\n\nFor generations, outsiders had considered the narrow isthmus to be the perfect spot for a trans-oceanic canal that would shorten the sea voyage by thousands of miles. Ships would no longer need to circumnavigate South America, braving the treacherous waters off Cape Horn. But the actual excavating of \u201cthe Big Ditch,\u201d as it became known, was far more challenging than any undertaking previously attempted.\n\nA French attempt to build a canal in the 1880s was met with disaster after scores of workers died from yellow fever and malaria amid allegations of financial mismanagement. The attempt, led by the famed developer of the Suez Canal Ferdinand de Lesseps, all but bankrupted France.\n\nFailing to reach terms with Colombia to build a US canal, then US President Theodore Roosevelt sent gunships to Panama\u2019s Atlantic and Pacific coasts to support calls for Panamanian independence. But celebrations in Panama after declaring independence were short-lived; public opinion in the new nation soured quickly over a treaty signed with the US that granted Americans open-ended use of the future canal.\n\nPanamanians accused their envoy to the US, French engineer and soldier Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, of betraying their interests to make a fortune from the deal he cut with the US. But dependent on the US to protect their freedom from Colombia, Panama\u2019s hands were tied.\n\nThe US imported workers to build the canal from across the Caribbean. An ingenious system of locks designed by the US Army Corps of Engineers raised ships from ocean level to Gatun Lake, the largest man-made lake at the time, where they could cross the isthmus.\n\nThe final explosion that flooded the canal was triggered from the White House via telegraph in 1913 by then-President Woodrow Wilson. \u201cCanal is opened by Wilson\u2019s finger,\u201d read the headline in next day\u2019s New York Times.\n\nOpening of the Panama Canal showing American Steamship SS Ancon leaving the west chamber of the upper Gatun locks and entering Gatun Lake, Panama, August 15, 1914. PhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\nThe US-controlled canal quickly became a vital asset for American commerce and the US Navy.\n\nPanama received a $10 million initial payment from the US for the territory followed by $250,000 each year. Many Panamanians resented that the canal that divided their country in half was off limits to them.\n\n\u201cIt was colonialism. The country was divided in two and you couldn\u2019t even go inside,\u201d said author Diaz-Espino of the Canal Zone. \u201cThey had everything. They had golf courses, they had recreation centers and at the other side of the fence was Panama.\u201d\n\nTensions steadily rose until January 1964 when riots broke out after demonstrators entered the off-limits Canal Zone and tried to raise the Panamanian flag there. Twenty-two Panamanian students and four US Marines died in the fighting that ensued.\n\nFor 13 years, US and Panamanian officials discussed a plan to return the canal to Panama during both Democrat and Republican administrations. Finally, in 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter reached an agreement with then-Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos for the US and Panama to jointly administer the crucial waterway, with the canal being fully turned over to Panama at midnight on December 31, 1999.\n\n\u201cFairness and not force should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world,\u201d Carter said at the signing ceremony for the accords.\n\nBut the final agreement still gave the US the right to intervene militarily to keep the canal open \u2013 a condition that could potentially be exploited by Trump in an attempt to retake the canal by force but unlikely to meet legal scrutiny as the canal continues to see record traffic.\n\nThe lucrative Panama Canal\n\nIn 2007, Panama began work on the canal\u2019s largest expansion in nearly a century, a new set of locks that would allow larger ships \u2013 more than one and a half times the size the ships that previously transited the waterway to travel through the canal. The new locks cost Panama more than $5 billion and went into operation in 2016. They also more than doubled the marine traffic the canal could handle.\n\n\u201cWe paid for it, we built it, and right now over 55% of the revenues of the Panama Canal are coming from that investment, not from the US investment that they made so long ago,\u201d former Administrator of the Panama Canal Jorge Luis Quijano told CNN.\n\nThe expanded canal has reaped billions of dollars for Panama and helped the country become a rare bastion of stability in Central America where other nations are beset by poverty and violent drug trafficking that fuel migration to the US.\n\nAnd its success has been noticed. \u201cPanama is doing so well with the canal, there are many workers, there is so much employment,\u201d Trump said in 2011. \u201cThe US foolishly gave the canal for nothing.\u201d\n\nPanama officials have made clear they would not stand for any attempt to seize the lucrative waterway, which about 5% of all global maritime traffic passes through. \u201cI fully reject the insinuating words by President Donald Trump at his inaugural address relating to Panama and its canal,\u201d Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said on X on Monday. \u201cThe canal is and will remain Panamanian and its administration will remain under Panamanian control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\u201d\n\nBut the specter of another US intervention has alarm bells sounding from a country that depends on both its namesake waterway and on good relations with Washington.\n\n\u201cThe Panama Canal is our oil, and this is as if you\u2019re threatening to take oil from Saudi Arabia, to take away the oil wells,\u201d said Diaz-Espino. \u201cThis would be devastating to the country. We\u2019d be left with the debt and without the income.\u201d",

This may sound like the start of a particularly silly joke, but it was a very real challenge faced by staff at a Japanese aquarium when they noticed their sunfish was ailing.\n\nAlmost as soon as the Kaikyokan Aquarium in Shimonoseki, southern Japan closed for renovation in December 2024, the sunfish became unwell, the aquarium said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out the cause and took various measures, but one of the staff members said, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s lonely because it misses the visitors?\u2019 We thought 99% chance \u2018No way!\u2019 But we attached the uniforms of the staff members (to the tank)\u201d with a little bit of hope, the aquarium said.\n\n\u201cThen\u2026the next day, it was in good health again!\u201d\n\nA picture posted by the aquarium shows the sunfish swimming in its tank, one of its eyes turned toward makeshift \u201cpeople\u201d made from cardboard cutout faces and aquarium uniforms on hangers stuck to the glass. Staff have been waving at the sunfish, too, in an effort to cheer it up.\n\nA lonely sunfish does seem unlikely, the aquarium said, but it added that this fish is curious and would swim up to the front of its tank whenever people came to visit.\n\nBut once visitors stopped coming, it stopped eating its jellyfish meals and began to rub its body against the tank, leading staff to suspect that it had developed digestive issues or was infected by parasites, Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.\n\nOcean sunfish live in the open sea in temperate and tropical regions all over the world, and have washed ashore in places as varied as Australia, California, Portugal, Spain and Oregon. They can grow staggeringly large, weighing up to 1,900 kilograms (more than 3,300 pounds) and measuring up to 3.3 meters (nearly 11 feet) long. This specimen in the aquarium is much smaller, but it shares the lopsided bullet-shaped body and long fins that give the species such a distinctive look.\n\nAnother Japanese aquarium came up with a similarly creative solution to keep its animals used to human interaction. During the Covid lockdown in 2020, Tokyo\u2019s Sumida Aquarium asked for volunteers to FaceTime its 300 spotted garden eels, who had become shy without the presence of visitors, making it difficult for staff to check up on them and make sure they were healthy.",

                "text": "AP \u2014\n\nA senior Taliban figure has urged the group\u2019s leader to scrap education bans on Afghan women and girls, saying there is no excuse for them, in a rare public rebuke of government policy.\n\nSher Abbas Stanikzai, political deputy at the Foreign Ministry, made the remarks in a speech on Saturday in southeastern Khost province.\n\nHe told an audience at a religious school ceremony there was no reason to deny education to women and girls, \u201cjust as there was no justification for it in the past and there shouldn\u2019t be one at all.\u201d\n\nThe government has barred females from education after sixth grade. Last September, there were reports authorities had also stopped medical training and courses for women.\n\nIn Afghanistan, women and girls can only be treated by female doctors and health professionals. Authorities have yet to confirm the medical training ban.\n\n\u201cWe call on the leadership again to open the doors of education,\u201d said Stanikzai in a video shared by his official account on the social platform X. \u201cWe are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a population of 40 million, depriving them of all their rights. This is not in Islamic law, but our personal choice or nature.\u201d\n\nStanikzai was once the head of the Taliban team in talks that led to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.\n\nIt is not the first time he has said that women and girls deserve to have an education. He made similar remarks in September 2022, a year after schools closed for girls and months and before the introduction of a university ban.\n\nBut the latest comments marked his first call for a change in policy and a direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.\n\nIbraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group\u2019s South Asia program, said Stanikzai had periodically made statements calling girls\u2019 education a right of all Afghan women.\n\n\u201cHowever, this latest statement seems to go further in the sense that he is publicly calling for a change in policy and questioned the legitimacy of the current approach,\u201d Bahiss said.\n\nIn the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, earlier this month, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders to challenge the Taliban on women and girls\u2019 education.\n\nShe was speaking at a conference hosted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Muslim World League.\n\nThe UN has said that recognition is almost impossible while bans on female education and employment remain in place and women can\u2019t go out in public without a male guardian.\n\nNo country recognizes the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, but countries like Russia have been building ties with them.\n\nIndia has also been developing relations with Afghan authorities.\n\nIn Dubai earlier this month, a meeting between India\u2019s top diplomat, Vikram Mistri, and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi showed their deepening cooperation.",

                "text": "Seoul, South Korea Reuters \u2014\n\nHundreds of supporters of South Korea\u2019s arrested president, Yoon Suk Yeol, stormed a court building early on Sunday after his detention was extended, smashing windows and breaking inside, an attack the country\u2019s acting leader called \u201cunimaginable.\u201d\n\nYoon on Wednesday became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested as he faces allegations of insurrection related to his stunning, short-lived December 3 declaration of martial law that has plunged the country into political turmoil.\n\nShortly after the court\u2019s decision was announced around 3 a.m. local time on Sunday, his supporters swarmed the building, overwhelming riot police trying to keep them at bay.\n\nProtesters blasted fire extinguishers at lines of police guarding the front entrance, then flooded inside, destroying office equipment, fittings and furniture, footage showed.\n\nPolice restored order a few hours later, saying they had arrested 46 protesters and vowing to track down others involved.\n\n\u201cThe government expresses strong regret over the illegal violence\u2026 which is unimaginable in a democratic society,\u201d acting President Choi Sang-mok said in a statement, adding that the authorities would step up safety measures around gatherings.\n\nNine police officers were injured in the chaos, Yonhap news agency reported. Police were not immediately available for comment on the injured officers.\n\nAbout 40 people suffered minor injuries, said an emergency responder near the Seoul Western District Court.\n\nSeveral of those involved live-streamed the intrusion on YouTube, showing protesters trashing the court and chanting Yoon\u2019s name. Some streamers were caught by police during their broadcasts.\n\nWith Yoon refusing to be questioned, investigators facing a deadline on detaining the president asked the court on Friday to extend his custody.\n\nAfter a five-hour hearing on Saturday, which Yoon attended, a judge granted a new warrant extending Yoon\u2019s detention for up to 20 days, due to \u201cconcern that the suspect may destroy evidence.\u201d\n\nSouth Korean regulations require a suspect detained under a warrant to undergo a physical exam, have a mugshot taken and wear a prison uniform.\n\nThe leader is being held in a solitary cell at the Seoul Detention Centre.\n\nThe corruption investigation office leading the probe said it had called Yoon in for further questioning on Sunday afternoon, but the prosecutor-turned-president has so far stonewalled their efforts to interrogate him.\n\nHis lawyers have argued the arrest is illegal because the warrant was issued in the wrong jurisdiction and the investigating team had no mandate for their probe.\n\nInsurrection, the crime that Yoon may be charged with, is one of the few that a South Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death. South Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.\n\n\u201cPresident Yoon Suk Yeol and our legal team will never give up,\u201d lawyers representing Yoon said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best in all future judicial procedures to correct the wrong,\u201d the lawyers said, adding that the violence at the court was an \u201cunfortunate\u201d incident.\n\nSeparate to the criminal probe that sparked Sunday\u2019s chaos, the Constitutional Court is deliberating whether to permanently remove him from office, in line with parliament\u2019s Dec. 14 impeachment, or restore his presidential powers.\n\nYoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party called the court\u2019s decision to extend his detention on Sunday a \u201cgreat pity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a question whether repercussions of detaining a sitting president were sufficiently considered,\u201d the party said in a statement.\n\nThe main opposition Democratic Party called the court\u2019s approval on the warrant a \u201ccornerstone\u201d for rebuilding order and said that \u201criots\u201d by \u201cfar-right\u201d groups would only deepen the national crisis.\n\nSupport for the PPP collapsed after his martial law declaration, which he rescinded hours later in the face of a unanimous vote in parliament rejecting it.\n\nBut in the turmoil since - in which the opposition-majority parliament also impeached his first replacement and investigators botched an initial attempt to arrest Yoon - the PPP\u2019s support has sharply rebounded.\n\nHis party has edged ahead of the opposition Democratic Party in support - 39% to 36% - for the first time since August, a Gallup Korea poll showed on Friday.\n\nThousands gathered for an orderly rally in support of Yoon in downtown Seoul on Sunday morning. Anti-Yoon demonstrations have also taken place across the city in recent days.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

We have updated them now,\u201d Regmi told Reuters.\n\nThe new rate will come into effect from September and apply for the popular climbing April-May season along the standard South East Ridge, or South Col route, pioneered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.\n\nFees for the less popular September-November season and the rarely climbed December-February season will also increase by 36%, to $7,500 and $3,750 respectively.\n\nSome expedition organisers said the increase, under discussion since last year, was unlikely to discourage climbers. About 300 permits are issued each year for Everest.\n\n\u201cWe expected this hike in permit fees,\u201d said Lukas Furtenbach of Austria-based expedition organiser, Furtenbach Adventures.\n\nHe said it was an \u201cunderstandable step\u201d from the government of Nepal. \u201cI am sure the additional funds will be somehow used to protect the environment and improve safety on Everest,\u201d Furtenbach said.\n\nRegmi did not say what the extra revenue would be used for.\n\nHundreds of climbers try to scale Mount Everest and several other Himalayan peaks every year.\n\nNepal is often criticised by mountaineering experts for allowing too many climbers on Everest and doing little to keep it clean or to ensure climbers\u2019 safety.\n\nRegmi said cleaning campaigns were organized to collect garbage and rope fixing as well as other safety measures were undertaken regularly.\n\nClimbers returning from the Everest say the mountain is becoming increasingly dry and rocky with less snow or other precipitation, which experts say could be due to global warming or other environmental changes.",

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThey call it the Freedom Trail. A line that snakes through Boston, a walking tour that takes in all the must-see locations where modern America began. Sure, at just two and a half miles it sounds short, but with so many \u201cfirsts\u201d to see, you\u2019ll need more than a day to do it justice.\n\nOne of those \u201cfirsts\u201d is where the Freedom Trail begins.\n\nBoston Common is America\u2019s very first public park. It was first set aside in 1640 for military training and grazing cattle before it became what it is today, a place to while away time and get acquainted with Boston\u2019s rich history. This place is, after all, where you\u2019ll find the story of America on every corner, where revolutionary zeal led to the fight for independence from the British.\n\nOne of the Freedom Trail\u2019s most important stop-offs is the Old South Meeting House, where many of the assemblies of those revolutionaries took place, including one before the Boston Tea Party \u2014 a 1773 taxation protest that saw chests of tea dumped in Boston\u2019s harbor, triggering a series of events that would turbocharge American independence.\n\nToday you can even head down to the water for a full-scale reenactment, with actors channeling their inner revolutionary and delivering word-for-word speeches. It\u2019s stirring stuff and reveals why it was no surprise that it all kicked off here in Boston.\n\nAfter all, this was one of the first English settlements in the American colonies, founded in 1630. And 140 years later, when parliament back home tried to impose a tea tax and a trading monopoly, let\u2019s just say things didn\u2019t go as the British had planned.\n\n\u201cWe look at the Boston Tea Party as the single most important event that led up to the American Revolution,\u201d says Evan O\u2019Brien, creative director of the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. He isn\u2019t wrong. The British viewed the Boston Tea Party as an act of treason and retaliated with punitive measures that would ultimately lead to conflict.\n\nBoston Harbor: Arguably where the revolution started. Kyle Klein/Meet Boston\n\n\u201cWe were the catalyst which then propelled America into actual war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were about a thousand people that night watching the destruction of the tea along the shores,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. As for \u201cmy personal family history. I\u2019m torn. I have a lot of English ancestry, a lot of American ancestry. So perhaps I\u2019d be on the shore watching and huzzah-ing along!\u201d\n\nHistory at every turn\n\nThere is, of course, a need to stop and eat too. An apt place is the Union Oyster House, which is claimed as the oldest continually operating restaurant in the United States.\n\nHere you can eat what are claimed as the best oysters in the world, straight from Duxbury Bay, a place with a deep, long history, about 35 miles south of Boston.\n\nBoston's Union Oyster House. Martin Thomas/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDuxbury is a location that\u2019s also pioneering the way towards a more sustainable future.\n\nShellfish farmer Skip Bennett grew up on these waters and has become the go-to guy for all things oyster. The delicious shellfish he trades in are a cornerstone of the Boston and New England culinary scene and go back way before the colonists decided they wanted a piece of the Massachusetts pie in the 17th century. Native Americans harvested the oysters here for centuries, the Wampanoag people continuing to assert their right to do so today.\n\nFor Bennett, his farming operation is all part of something bigger. He has previously dubbed Duxbury Bay as the Napa Valley of oysters and his harvest sells to the very best restaurants in the city. But, as he points out, his oysters act as a vital filter for water which has been polluted by nitrogen. Their presence helps to prevent algal blooms and create cleaner, clearer water. And that\u2019s before the economic benefits of having his own hatchery and nursery, as well as staff whose dollars remain in the local area, creating a stronger economy in the process.\n\nThis whole place is personal for Bennett, too. From his oyster farm, you can see where the first pilgrims arrived in \u201cNew England\u201d in 1620.\n\n\u201cThis is Clark\u2019s Island. It\u2019s part of Plymouth. It\u2019s in the middle of Duxbury, in Plymouth Bay. And it\u2019s actually where the pilgrims spent their first Sabbath. So they came ashore and spent a few days in late December, 1620. My family settled here and they never left, they\u2019ve been here ever since the Mayflower.\u201d\n\nHang on a moment, is Bennett saying he\u2019s a direct descendant of those famous Mayflower pilgrims?\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody on the Mayflower!\u201d\n\nThe midnight message\n\nThe Paul Revere House on the Freedom Trail. Ian Dagnall/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nIn Boston there\u2019s more of those \u201cfirsts.\u201d There\u2019s the aforementioned Boston Common and, of course, Harvard, founded in 1636 and the very first university in North America.\n\nAnd back on the Freedom Trail, the phrase: oldest continuously operating is a recurring theme. The plaques that mark them are dotted everywhere, even in places like Ebenezer Hancock House, apparently the site of the United States\u2019 oldest continually operating shoe store, which opened in 1798 and went out of business in 1968.\n\nSomeone strong connections to the Freedom Trail is Paul Revere. His house is one of the key stop-offs and for good reason. It was his midnight ride on April 18, 1775, that warned that the British were coming and helped the Patriots win the battles of Concord and Lexington.\n\nRevere\u2019s ride was famously immortalized by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1860 poem \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride.\u201d But while that classic work broadly tells the correct story of Revere\u2019s efforts, Longfellow\u2019s poetic licence means that a few lines are what might politely be termed fictionalized.\n\nNina Zannieri is the executive director at the Paul Revere House and is on hand for fact-checking a few lines.\n\n\u201cHe said to his friend if the British march by land or sea\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sea is confusing to people.

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nFeel like airport security lines keep getting longer, or that you\u2019re booking hotel reservations way further in advance than you used to?\n\nIt\u2019s true. The UN\u2019s World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has just released its 2024 year-in-review data, confirming that the tourism industry has bounced back from the pandemic.\n\nAbout 1.4 billion people traveled internationally last year, which is 99% of the number who did the same in 2019, the last full year before Covid-19 hit the world.\n\nThat amounted to $1.9 trillion being spent in the tourism industry, meaning each tourist spent more than $1,000 per person on average.\n\nBut where did people go?\n\nOverall, Europe was the most-visited continent with 747 million tourists in 2024, according to the UNWTO.\n\nThat number was especially impressive considering that Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine kept travelers away from parts of the region, notes the tourism body in its report.\n\nFrance was the world\u2019s most-visited nation in 2024, with 100 million tourists, according to figures recently released by the country\u2019s tourism board. Spain made a strong showing with 98 million tourists to land in second place.\n\n\u201c2024 was an exceptional year for French tourism, promising prospects for 2025!\u201d Atout France, the country\u2019s national tourism marketing department, said in a statement.\n\nThe statement cited the 2024 Summer Olympics, the re-opening of Paris\u2019 iconic Notre Dame cathedral, and the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy as three major events that people traveled to France for in the past year.\n\nMeanwhile, the UNWTO reports that 316 million people traveled to Asia and the Pacific in 2024, 213 million went to the Americas, 95 million to the Middle East and 74 million to Africa. There was no data on tourism to Antarctica.\n\nSmall countries, big gains\n\nThe usual big tourism players weren\u2019t the only ones with rising tourist numbers.\n\nIn the Middle East, Qatar experienced an impressive 137% increase in tourists. Much of that was fueled by the country\u2019s investment in infrastructure: Qatar Airways was named the world\u2019s best airline in 2024, while Doha\u2019s Hamad International snagged the title of the world\u2019s best airport.\n\nOther smaller countries celebrated big wins for tourism last year, including Andorra, the micro-state on the France-Spain border, as well as the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Albania and El Salvador.\n\nVisitors pass graffiti reading \"Tourist Go Home\" in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, on Friday, July 26, 2024. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nLooking to 2025 and beyond\n\nGlobal tourism isn\u2019t just returning to previous highs \u2014 it seems to be on an upward trajectory.\n\nSpain, the world\u2019s second most visited country, marked 2024 with several major anti-tourist movements: residents shooting water pistols at travelers in Barcelona, Seville weighing an entry fee and mass protests in the Canary Islands, among others.\n\nIn Italy, which had 23% year-over-year growth, the popular cities of Venice and Florence have both banned large tour groups. Around the country, overtourism prevention measures took a variety of forms, including night swimming bans, \u201cstoplights\u201d to indicate when an area was too crowded and rules prohibiting people from reserving coveted beach spaces with umbrellas the night before.\n\nIn its annual release, the UNWTO\u2019s panel of experts cautioned that \u201cbalancing growth and sustainability will be critical in 2025\u201d and advised \u201cthe discovery of lesser-known destinations.\u201d\n\nAtout France also tempered its celebrations for being the world\u2019s most-visited country, stating that its goal is \u201cto make France the world\u2019s leading destination for sustainable tourism.\u201d",

But owner Margo Neas said Wednesday that as she waited for Mittens to be unloaded from the plane\u2019s freight area, three hours passed with no sign of the cat.\n\nIt was then that ground staff told Neas the plane had returned to New Zealand \u2014 with Mittens still on board. The return trip involves about 7.5 hours in the air.\n\n\u201cI said, how can this happen? How can this happen? Oh my God,\u201d Neas said.\n\nThe Air New Zealand pilot was told of the extra passenger during the flight and turned on the heating in the cargo hold to keep Mittens comfortable, she added. Neas was told that a stowed wheelchair had obscured a baggage handler\u2019s view of Mittens\u2019 cage.\n\n\u201cIt was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn\u2019t have the family, we weren\u2019t complete,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the saga had a happy ending. The pet moving company that Neas used to arrange Mittens\u2019 travel met the cat on her return to Christchurch and ensured she was back on the plane for another trip to Melbourne \u2014 this time just one way.\n\nMittens had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed.\n\n\u201cShe basically just ran into my arms and just snuggled up in here and just did the biggest cuddles of all time,\u201d Neas said. \u201cIt was just such a relief.\u201d\n\nAir New Zealand would reimburse all costs associated with Mittens\u2019 travel and has apologized for the distress caused, the airline said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work closely with our ground handler in Melbourne to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d said spokesperson Alisha Armstrong.\n\nMeanwhile Mittens, not usually an affectionate pet, is \u201cthe cuddliest she\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Neas.\n\n\u201cThe cat gets as much attention as she wants right now because we\u2019re just so absolutely and utterly relieved to have her back.\u201d",

                "text": "Milan CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s been a tumultuous start to 2025 on the world stage \u2014 and the first international fashion catwalks of the year have reacted with themes of protection, resilience and comfort.\n\nThe latest menswear shows in Milan for the Fall-Winter 2025 season left their usual buoyant mood at the door. Instead, the focus was two-fold: timeless style featuring classic fabrics like shearling, leather and denim; and high-performance outerwear that innovated with cutting-edge materials.\n\n\u201cThe world is becoming so conservative, and everybody asks us designers to be revolutionary, but what is happening in the world is not a celebration,\u201d Prada\u2019s head designer, Miuccia Prada, told journalists backstage.\n\nShe added that her collection was \u201ca bit of an answer, as always, to what is happening.\u201d\n\nShearling\u2026 with added protection\n\nDouble leather at the Prada show. Courtesy Prada\n\nShearling trim featured heavily in the Prada collection. Estrop/Getty Images\n\nOn Prada\u2019s runway, coats and jackets flanked in faux fur dominated a collection that was grounded in heavy-duty cowboy boots. The Italian fashion house leaned into love-worn favorites \u2014 chunky frayed knitwear and patchwork leather suits.\n\nPrada, and her co-creative director Raf Simons, made special note of their use of shearling. The distinctive material lined hoods and long peacoats. Elsewhere, there were talisman-esque adornments on shrunken and frayed knits.\n\nHere, \u201cshearling becomes a layer of sensual security, worn inside and out,\u201d explained Prada and Simons. They added that the knitwear, adorned with metal symbols much like amulets, was \u201cin a way, protecting us.\u201d\n\nHeritage investment pieces\n\nFor his third collection for British menswear brand, Dunhill, creative director Simon Holloway talked of \u201ccontinuing consistently appropriate wardrobing,\u201d in his show notes. To do so, he looked back to the sporty sensibility of suits favored by the Duke of Windsor in the 1930s.\n\nHolloway added \u201cregimental\u201d navy-inspired bridge and peacoats \u2014 and dug into the fashion house\u2019s illustrious archive, elaborating on founder\u2019s Alfred Dunhill\u2019s car coats in double-faced suede and wool-cashmere. The result was wear-forever investment staples.\n\nElsewhere, Italian luxury footwear brand, Tods, celebrated \u201csubtle and timeless style\u201d \u2014introducing a new ultra-light nappa pashmy leather (a sought-after variety of goatskin) and making its driving shoe, the Gommino, the star of its show.\n\nThe Dolce & Gabbana show featured some of the Italian brand's most popular signatures - from red carpet tailoring to leopard print. Shutterstock\n\nAt Dolce & Gabbana, designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana continued to celebrate their Italian heritage. This time, they looked to Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d from which, they told the gathered journalists, the term \u201cPaparazzi\u201d originated (the movie\u2019s main character, a photographer, is named Paparazzo). To emphasize the point, they featured camera-wielding models in head-to-toe black suits madly clicking flashbulbs every time a model appeared on the catwalk.\n\nTheir collection ran the gamut of the brand\u2019s most popular signatures from the last three decades \u2014 from impeccably cut red carpet-ready tailoring to double denim, flashes of leopard print, and a healthy smattering of sequins.\n\nDouble denim\n\nDouble denim featured heavily at this year's show, as seen in the MSGM collection. Courtesy MSGM\n\nFew things are as sartorially reliable in a man\u2019s wardrobe as denim. This season, designers went large for the hardwearing material. Massimo Giorgetti at MSGM went full double denim as did Dolce & Gabbana, while at Prada the material popped up as a duster coat.\n\nEven brands that wouldn\u2019t normally be associated with the true-blue staple dabbled in denim. At Brunello Cuccinelli, a brand more synonymous for its relaxed tailoring and cashmere neutrals, we saw raw-edged denim. While at Dunhill, a classic houndstooth blazer and neckerchief was paired with a perfectly pressed pair of jeans.\n\nHigh performance outerwear\n\nIntrepid fashion at the Emporio Armani show. Pietro D'Aprano/Getty Images\n\nDesigners explored innovations in high-performance outerwear materials. Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBrands didn\u2019t just look to the past for inspiration, also embracing high-performance outerwear and material innovation. Saul Nash, the London-based designer making his Milan debut, expanded on his sports-inspired repertoire, incorporating enveloping parkas using PrimaLoft padding and chunky cummerbunds designed to double up as scarves and be transformed into crossbody bags.\n\nAt Italian Luxury fashion house Stone Island, \u201cBladerunner\u201d was on the mood board. The collection featured a new hardwearing gabardine produced from its own castoff materials transformed into an anorak complete with rubber-covered buttonholes and a high-neck hood to provide \u201can extra layer of protection.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Italian brand Brioni turned its beautifully-constructed blazers hybrid with detachable insulating gilets \u2014 a first for the brand. And the Milanese leather goods brand Valextra expanded its Assoluto collection crafted from the regenerated nylon yarn EcoNyl \u2014 fusing cutting-edge technical details with the traditional craftsmanship it is famed for.\n\nOversized, padded and cocooning outwear at the Mordecai show. Courtesy Mordecai\n\nAt Mordecai, creative director Ludovico Bruno said his show, \u201cThe Intelligence of Others,\u201d was \u201can ode to resilience (and the) extraordinary adaptability of human beings.\u201d Modelled on contemporary dancers who moved in pumped-up synchronization to Igor Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring,\u201d the collection featured oversized, padded and cocooning outerwear. This was designed to \u201cfunction as shields,\u201d said Bruno, adding that the outerwear was \u201cready to protect and comfort with their softness and enveloping design.\u201d\n\nThe high-octane theme continued at the Giorgio Armani show \u201413 looks of full-blown, head-to-toe, high-performance hiking-cum-skiwear. Models were equipped with backpacks, ropes, and goggles for their fashion expedition.\n\nEnding on a romantic note\n\nThe resilient mood came with messages of hope from several designers who used their moment to encourage togetherness. \u201cMy wish for this new year is peace and serenity in the world, and there are finally some encouraging signs,\u201d Armani told CNN.\n\nThere was perhaps no better demonstration of this than at JordanLuca, where co-designers and founders Jordan Bowen and Luca Marchetto surprised guest by getting married on the catwalk at the end of their show.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s atomized world, love becomes more vital and unselfish than ever, as we walk together into whatever comes next,\u201d they said.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEach summer, the remote Italian island of Alicudi attracts a slow drip of tourists looking to escape the trappings of modernity. There are no cars or even roads on the two-square-mile volcanic outcrop, though footpaths are traversable by donkey. And while cellphone coverage is now available in most places, many houses lack electricity and water.\n\nFor the island\u2019s residents, of whom there are around 100 (and whose number fall steeply in the winter), the remainder of the year is arguably far from idyllic.\n\nWith no hospital, residents must travel by ferry \u2014 or, in an emergency, helicopter \u2014 for medical treatment. The island\u2019s school is reportedly closed due to the shortage of children, according to Italian photographer Camilla Marrese, who visited Alicudi during the Covid-19 pandemic to document everyday life there. And while there are two grocery stores and a bar to socialize in, the latter is only open three months of the year, she added.\n\nFishing is a mainstay of life on Alicudi, though tourism has transformed the island's economy. Camilla Marrese and Gabriele Chiapparini\n\n\u201cFor the rest of the year, the big social gathering (entails) going down to the pier when the boats come in \u2014 they just go there to check who arrived and who\u2019s leaving,\u201d Marrese told CNN in a Zoom interview alongside her partner and collaborator Gabriele Chiapparini, who added: \u201cSome houses are two hours\u2019 walk away from the pier, so those people watch through binoculars.\u201d\n\nHoping to capture a rare snapshot of the island and its inhabitants during winter, Marrese and Chiapparini spent a total of two months exploring Alicudi, photographing its nature and befriending its residents. The resulting book, \u201cThinking Like an Island,\u201d brings together stark portraits and landscape shots that speak to a profound sense of isolation.\n\nAlicudi might have been populated as early as the 17th century BC, though migration in both directions \u2014 including the departure of islanders to the Italian mainland and further afield, Australia in particular \u2014 have seen its demographics change significantly in recent decades. Marrese described the current population as comprising \u201cmany islands within that same island\u201d \u2014 a combination of long-term locals (some of whom she said humorously refer to themselves as \u201cindigenous\u201d) and outsiders who have moved from elsewhere in Europe seeking a quiet life.\n\n\u201cWe spoke with a lot of people who chose the island because they are tired of how the world is going right now: climate change, pollution, the way we cultivate vegetables or our economic systems,\u201d Chiapparini said.\n\nAlicudi is the westernmost island of the Aeolian archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily. Camilla Marrese and Gabriele Chiapparini\n\nYet, the pair also discovered a unique sense of community, despite the lack of meeting places or shared social spaces.\n\n\u201cAll the houses are scattered, so it\u2019s very hard for a sense of community to develop,\u201d Marrese said. \u201cOf course, there is a big sense of belonging; everyone knows everyone else and is willing to help one another. I think the bonds they have are really tight. At the same time, it\u2019s (a microcosm of) the best and the worst of society, because there is also lots of unnecessary conflict and small (acts of) revenge.\u201d\n\nMarrese compared the islanders\u2019 coexistence to life in a condo: \u201cYou don\u2019t like your neighbors, but when the storm comes, you go down (to the water) and take everybody else\u2019s boats up and you help each other.\u201d\n\nThe photographers found that the islanders\u2019 mentality, perhaps due to the transient nature of its seasonal population, made it easy for them to quickly earn trust and convince people to pose for photos.\n\n\u201cThey are very much used to building strong connections quickly \u2014 to creating social situations and strong relationships. And also they are very used to seeing people go away, to have this turnover of people and dealing with the fact that things are not permanent somehow.\u201d\n\nMarrese and Chiapparini also turned their lenses on the island's rugged topography. Camilla Marrese and Gabriele Chiapparini\n\nThe \u2018crazy rye\u2019\n\nThe portraits in \u201cThinking Like an Island\u201d feature islanders out in nature or posing on the shore beneath ominous skies. Their names are often excluded, while some subjects\u2019 faces have been obscured entirely to protect their privacy.\n\nThis only adds to the sense of mystery surrounding the island, which is rich in local folklore. In fact, Marrese and Chiapparini\u2019s book does not even explicitly identify the location by name, although anyone familiar with the topography and mythology discussed will immediately recognize it as Alicudi. (An outlying island of the Aeolian archipelago, in the Tyrrhenian Sea north of Sicily, it recently made headlines after becoming overrun by goats, which outnumber people by around six to one.)\n\nAnd there is one curious piece of local history unique to the island: its accidental production of hallucinogen-laced bread.\n\nUntil as recently as the 1950s, locals ate loaves contaminated by a rye fungus called ergot, the base ingredient of LSD. Generations of villagers unknowingly ate the so-called \u201ccrazy rye\u201d or \u201chorned rye,\u201d which may be the source of various local myths, like the flying women (or \u201cmaiara,\u201d meaning \u201csorceress\u201d in Aeolian dialect) that were said to occupy the skies above Alicudi.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of legends that have been passed through the generations,\u201d Marrese said. \u201cAnd they could actually have been a hallucinatory moment that was shared by all the inhabitants of the island who were eating this bread every day.\u201d\n\nThe photographers said the islanders were \"used to building strong connections quickly\" and were often open to having their portraits taken. Camilla Marrese and Gabriele Chiapparini\n\nMarrese and Chiapparini also explored other parts of the island\u2019s culture, such as an annual procession featuring a statue of Saint Bartolo and traditional practices like weaving and caper harvesting. They were at pains to present Alicudi as neither utopia nor dystopia, despite harsh economic realities. But even the relatively small levels of tourism have transformed fortunes on the island.\n\nThe photographers say many of the residents moved from the upper reaches of the island down to the sea, and that most young men now work in construction, renovating or building houses to rent out in the summer.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very poor,\u201d Marrese said. \u201cUntil the second half of the last century, the economy was mainly agriculture and fishing\u2026 then electricity came (in the 1990s), tourism came and money came \u2014 and everything changed all of a sudden.\u201d\n\nPower of the island\n\nAs well as shooting conventional portraits, Chiapparini and Marrese \u2014 both of whom captured images for the book \u2014 turned their lenses on the island itself. Alicudi\u2019s rugged topography, with its sculptural rock faces and steep crags, becomes one of their book\u2019s key protagonists.\n\nThe pair were especially interested in the impact this geography had on the islanders, as it seemingly shaped their outlook and character. \u201cI think living on the island makes you evolve, physically and psychologically,\u201d Marrese said, noting the ease with which inhabitants navigate the island in the darkness of night.\n\nThe pair's book \"Thinking Like an Island\" combines portraits of the Alicudi's inhabitants with scenes captured across the island. Camilla Marrese and Gabriele Chiapparini\n\n\u201cLiving in this way really permeates them and shapes them\u2026 they\u2019re very much more connected to the rhythm of the sun going up and the sun going down,\u201d she added.\n\nThe experience left its mark on Chiapparini and Marrese, too, with both reporting a strong personal connection to the island. The pair remain in touch with several residents, and they say their experiences left them with a greater, lasting appreciation for the simple life.\n\n\u201cWe went back this summer, and when I\u2019m there, I think \u2018Why don\u2019t we live here?\u201d Marrese said. \u201cThen, actually, we (realize we) don\u2019t really want to live there, but there is a very, very strong bond you take with you.\n\n\u201cSomething that stays with you, ideologically, is that there isn\u2019t just one way in which you have to live \u2014 there are many different ways,\u201d she added. \u201cThey can have pros and cons, and can be very different from yours. But they (the islanders) are alright with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThinking Like an Island,\u201d published by Overlapse, is available now.",

She won a historic bronze medal as a member of the US Women\u2019s Rugby Sevens squad, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s \u201cSwimsuit Edition,\u201d finished runner-up on \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d garnered new endorsements on her social media accounts, and signed a contract to play with England\u2019s Bristol Bears rugby team \u2014 which moved its matches to a bigger stadium to satisfy the surge in ticket demand upon her arrival.\n\nAll the while, she became the most followed rugby player on the planet with 8 million fans (and counting) across social media platforms.\n\nBecause for 28-year-old Maher, it isn\u2019t just about the accolades \u2014 it\u2019s about her message. With her signature sense of humor (and ever-present bold lipstick), she has spoken openly about body image, confidence and beauty \u201cstandards,\u201d breaking the traditional mold and inspiring millions of followers in the process.\n\nSo, how does it feel to have become America\u2019s sweetheart?\n\n\u201cI love when people call me that because I feel like I\u2019m maybe not the image you would have of a sweetheart in some sense of the word,\u201d Maher told CNN\u2019s Christina Macfarlane during a recent interview in Maher\u2019s hometown of Burlington, Vermont.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, she adds, \u201cThis was kind of the trajectory I wanted it to take. I knew that in my sport, I wouldn\u2019t just get to play my sport and be happy with it. I knew that I had to do more to have a comfortable life for myself, to spread my game, to spread rugby in general. So for years now, I\u2019ve been leading up to this point, hoping to do what I\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m so happy that this worked out like it did.\u201d\n\nA highlight of Ilona Maher's whirlwind 2024 was posing for a digital cover of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit edition. For the US rugby star, it was a dream come true. \"When the call came, I was like, 'yeah, I want to do this thing.' I've always wanted to do it, and I was recently asked, 'Oh, how was it to be in a swimsuit all day? Was it scary? I was like, 'it was awesome.' I loved it,\" Maher tells CNN.

She made it to the finale of the reality dancing competition with her partner, Alan Bersten, as the pair ultimately finished runner-up. Competing on the show was \"very tough for me,\" Maher tells CNN. \"You're going out there to do something you're not good at in front of millions of people. But I'm so happy I did it.\" Eric McCandless/Disney/Getty Images The 2024 Olympics helped make Maher a star, capped with a first-ever medal for Team USA Women's Rugby Sevens as they defeated Australia in the bronze medal match in Paris, on July 30 (pictured). Three years earlier, it was the Tokyo Olympics that first elevated Maher's profile, and she says she's been posting videos on social media ever since. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images As Maher became the face of her sport and beyond, she found herself sitting across from late-night TV hosts including Seth Meyers, pictured here holding up her Paris Olympics bronze medal during an interview on August 12, 2024. Lloyd Bishop/NBC Maher, pictured here ahead of the 76th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles in September 2024, says it\u2019s important to remind people \u201cI\u2019m so much more than just an athlete \u2026 (people) forget the personalities that (female athletes) have, how funny we are, the friendships, the way we are outside (our sport), the way we like to get dressed up.\u201d Stewart Cook/Disney/Getty Images Maher's 2024 ended with the announcement that she signed a contract to join the Bristol Bears rugby team in Bristol, England, part of the Premiership Women's Rugby league. Maher made her debut on the field against Gloucester-Hartpury on January 5, 2025 (pictured). \"My goal is to show how exciting women's rugby can be,\" Maher says. Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters In pictures: Ilona Maher's year for the ages Prev Next\n\n\u201cNever tone it down\u201d\n\nFirst and foremost, Maher is an athlete \u2014 one who is proud of her body, and what it can achieve, she says. But people often forget that athletes are more than what they see on the field.\n\n\u201cI think (people) put female athletes, especially, into a box, like that\u2019s all she is \u2014 \u2018She plays on the field and that\u2019s it.\u2019 They forget the personalities that we have, how funny we are, the friendships, the way we are outside, the way we like to get dressed up,\u201d Maher said.\n\n\u201cSo it was important for me to show many sides of me and the body positivity, body appreciation side kind of came naturally in a way because it is something that I feel strongly about. Also, with a lot of my content, I try to see what\u2019s relatable for others. And it\u2019s so interesting in my time of learning to appreciate my body, you kind of start to realize, \u2018Oh, everybody has insecurities.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaher credits her parents \u2014 including her father Michael, who has played rugby for more than 40 years \u2014 for getting her into sports and supporting a positive body image, even as she \u201cstruggled with that growing up.\u201d\n\nIlona Maher (left), with her sisters Adrianna and Olivia, in Lake Champlain, Vermont, around 2005. The Maher Family\n\nMaher (center) with family: mother Mieneke (left), sisters Olivia and Adrianna, and father Michael, at the Vancouver Sevens 2023. The Maher Family\n\nIlona Maher didn't start playing rugby until high school but quickly fell in love with the sport. Pictured: Maher after her first game for South Burlington High School Club Rugby in 2014. The Maher Family\n\n\u201cI have a body that a lot of people would say is not feminine or is not beautiful or is too strong, too this and that,\u201d she said. \u201cI never understood why my big body looked like this, yet I was always so fit and I was always so fast and I could always keep up. I didn\u2019t look like them, so I just love that people are seeing me.\u201d\n\nBut learning she should never apologize for who she is was a crucial lesson \u2014 and it came from her father. While playing fast-pitch softball as a young girl, Maher recalled, another father on the opposing team came up to her and said she needed to slow down \u2014 not one of the other players could hit her pitches.\n\nMaher\u2019s own dad was having none of it. He pulled out the rule book and said, \u201cThis is a fast-pitch league. She gets to throw fast pitches,\u201d Maher remembered.\n\n\u201cI think that was the first moment of being told to never tone it down,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause that dad over there \u2026 wanted me to tone myself down so that it could be easier for (his daughter). But that\u2019s not the world, is it? The world isn\u2019t going to tone down for you.\u201d\n\nImposter syndrome? Not for Maher\n\nSpend any time scrolling through comments under Maher\u2019s social media posts, and it won\u2019t take long to see her confidence is a trait so many of her fans admire.\n\nAnd what she doesn\u2019t have, she says, is imposter syndrome.\n\n\u201cI feel like I deserve what I\u2019ve got,\u201d Maher told CNN. \u201cI think I\u2019ve worked very hard, even in the rugby space \u2026 And then I do all the work off the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cI posted videos consistently from (the 2020 Tokyo Olympics) until now,\u201d she added. \u201cI put myself out there, I put my whole personality \u2014 my whole everything \u2014 out there. So maybe I have a little (imposter syndrome) sometimes \u2026 but it\u2019s OK to be proud of what you\u2019ve done, and it\u2019s OK to believe that you\u2019ve worked to earn this.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, not long after her interview with CNN, Maher posted a video on her social media accounts lamenting the concept of imposter syndrome and the fact that people often assume successful women have it.\n\nIlona Maher meets young Bristol Bears supporters at Ashton Gate stadium in Bristol, England, on December 8, 2024, after the club announced her signing. Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nHer unapologetic self continues to resonate. After her on-field debut with the Bristol Bears on January 5 \u2014 which featured a regular season league record crowd \u2014 Maher spent over an hour talking to fans, signing autographs and taking selfies.\n\n\u201cHopefully, what my fans see is also a person who\u2019s not perfect, who shows every side of themselves \u2026 it\u2019s a constant battle of learning to love and appreciate your body. It\u2019s never going to be, \u2018I got it. I figured it out,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe says she\u2019s grateful for the people who\u2019ve helped her see her own body in this light, highlighting the role of rugby \u2014 a sport that shows what the body is capable of.\n\n\u201cThat was what really helped me. And then my teammates \u2014 being around other women like that who are so confident kind of feeds into your confidence \u2026 It comes from inside,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cBut it also can come from those outside factors and surrounding yourself with really good people.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWith her eyes almost entirely obscured by the rim of her wool boater-style hat, Melania Trump stood behind President-elect Donald Trump on stage at the United States Capitol Rotunda as he pledged the oath of office.\n\nDesigned by New York-based milliner Eric Javits, Trump\u2019s hat was an austere flourish to a neat, military-style ensemble. Her navy silk wool double-breasted coat was nipped at the waist and worn with bare legs and stiletto heels.\n\nThe piece was designed by Adam Lippes, a New York-based designer who has dressed Biden and Michelle Obama. (Trump has previously worn Lippes several times, most recently choosing a shirtdress from the fashion house last summer while out in New York and wore the label several times during her husband\u2019s first term.) Beneath the tailored coat was a silk wool pencil skirt and an ivory silk crepe blouse folded into a sharp neckline, all hand-sewn by Lippes\u2019 team in New York. \u201cThe tradition of the presidential inauguration embodies the beauty of American democracy and today we had the honor to dress our first lady, Mrs. Melania Trump,\u201d Lippes said in a statement. \u201cMrs. Trump\u2019s outfit was created by some of America\u2019s finest craftsmen and I take great pride in showing such work to the world.\u201d\n\nThe only sign that this was the coldest inauguration ceremony in 40 years came from her black leather gloves.\n\nDonald Trump goes to kiss Melania shortly before being sworn in as the 47th US President. Saul Loeb/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut it was the millinery that turned heads. \u201c(With) her face half hidden by her hat, Melania remains aloof,\u201d said professor Nichola Gutgold, author of \u201cElecting Madam Vice President: When Women Run, Women Win,\u201d in an email to CNN.\n\nShe appeared elusive, with a slight combative edge to her ensemble \u2014 something that is not unusual for Trump. Throughout her first term as first lady from 2017 to 2021, Trump\u2019s stylistic evolution came to include more structured, military-inspired dresses and skirt suits in khaki, navy and gray. \u201cAs the public persona emerged, she still craved privacy,\u201d Kate Bennett, a former CNN White House correspondent, said ahead of the inauguration. \u201cHer clothes, in my opinion, really reflected that. \u2026 Her silhouettes became long-sleeved, cinched waists, hard shoulders, longer hemline, like almost a military-esque vibe. I think that\u2019s because it felt like armor \u2026 Because she underwent four years of really intense scrutiny.\u201d\n\nFormer First Lady Jill Biden's bipartisan purple outfit was from American designer Ralph Lauren. Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFrom left: CEO of Meta and Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk were among the high-profile tech entrepreneurs at the ceremony. Saul Loeb/POOL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWife of Vice President JD Vance, Usha, channelled Jackie Kennedy in a pink Oscar de la Renta coat dress and suede boots. Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nThe incoming first lady\u2019s precise, structured outfit was thrown into sharper focus when she stood near Jill Biden, who had chosen a softer silhouette, on the steps of the White House. Biden\u2019s relaxed, tie-waist overcoat and blouse \u2014 both in the bipartisan color purple \u2014 was designed by Ralph Lauren. The storied US label was credited with creating Trump\u2019s 2017 powder blue inauguration look, which was heavily likened to Jackie Kennedy.\n\nIf, eight years ago, Trump hoped to emulate one of the most revered first ladies in history, then she was trying something new this time around. Others interpreted the look through a more regal lens. Gutgold said Trump\u2019s hat evoked a \u201cQueenly aura,\u201d while chief fashion critic for the New York Times, Vanessa Friedman, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that Trump appeared \u201cmore royal family governess than necessarily American first lady.\u201d In 2017, she used the soft power of fashion to align herself with perhaps the most accessible presidential wife. Now, it seems her outfit is about creating distance \u2014 a physical shield to the outside world.\n\nInstead it was Usha Vance, wife of new Vice President JD Vance, who seemed to be taking cues from Kennedy. Vance was spotted in a custom Oscar de la Renta pastel pink cashmere coat dress \u2014 a hue that seems inextricable from Kennedy\u2019s legacy, from the bubblegum pink Christian Dior gown she wore to receive the French minister of culture to the White House in 1962 to the Chanel suit worn the day her husband was assassinated. Similarly, Priscilla Chan arrived with her husband Mark Zuckerberg in a baby blue twin-set and three strands of pearls: a 60s-inspired look that seemed to be a nod to the late first lady.\n\nBut not everyone was using the fashion history rulebook. American journalist and wife of Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sanchez, arrived at the ceremony in a white suit worn shirtless \u2014 exposing her matching lingerie-style top. And while Melania Trump made sure to wear a US designer, Ivanka Trump embraced a continental slant to her dressing, attending the event in a forest green beret-style hat and Christian Dior bag.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump wasn't the only attendee in an eye-catching hat. Ivanka Trump opted for a forest green beret. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nThere were few surprises when it came to menswear, with almost all male attendees wearing dark-colored two-piece suits (though a remarkably casual Sen. John Fetterman was a notable exception in shorts and a hooded sweatshirt). The president himself opted for a broad-shouldered cut with a red-and-blue necktie. Elsewhere, several of Trump\u2019s closest allies \u2014 including his son Donald Jr., Vance and secretary of defense nominee Pete Hegseth, as well as UFC boss Dana White \u2014 sported the kind of bright red necktie that, when combined with a navy suit, has long been a signature Trump look. By contrast, former presidents in attendance all went for blues of differing shades, with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in check and striped ties, respectively.\n\nAs day turned to night, the first lady\u2019s fashion was in the spotlight once again. For the inaugural balls, Melania Trump wore a strapless white silk dress featuring thick black bands that zig-zagged across her torso and trailed down to the floor.\n\nThe look was created by Herv\u00e9 Pierre, the French-American designer behind the cream dress she wore to the 2017 inauguration balls. Trump\u2019s longtime stylist and a couture designer in his own right, Pierre had earlier invited speculation by posting part of a scene from Disney\u2019s \u201cCinderella\u201d (in which mice and birds work on Cinderella\u2019s ballgown) to Instagram Stories. On Monday evening, he confirmed his involvement in a statement to Women\u2019s Wear Daily, saying it was an \u201chonor\u201d to collaborate with her.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that Mrs. Trump was gravitating towards a combination of black and white \u2013 true to her own style and vision,\u201d added Pierre, who has worked for labels including Oscar de la Renta and Carolina Herrera, and has previously helped make outfits for first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n\nMelania Trump pictured in a Herv\u00e9 Pierre creation at the Commander-In-Chief inaugural ball. Pierre said on Instagram that the gown's zigzag was inspired by a \"simple scribble.\" Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nElsewhere, second lady Vance attended the evening balls in an embroidered d\u00e9grad\u00e9 gown by New York-based Lebanese designer Reem Acra. In an email to CNN, Acra described Vance as \u201ca true vision of grace and style on this monumental evening.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to include new details as they emerge.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBy the time each U.S. President is sworn in, the first lady may already be a familiar face, either due to her campaign trail appearances (or absences), or prior roles within the White House. And, since 1965, when Lady Bird Johnson spearheaded her environmental campaigns, it has also become customary for first ladies \u2014 and, presumably in the future, first gentlemen \u2014 to prepare their own policies.\n\nStill, the presidential inauguration has long been an opportunity for the first lady to make an immediate first impression \u2014 and they\u2019ve often done so through their fashion choices during the day-to-evening affair. In 2021, Dr. Jill Biden promoted the spirit of unity through subtle symbolism, wearing a custom ivory dress and cashmere coat by Gabriela Hearst, embroidered with the federal flowers from every U.S. state and territory. Four years earlier, Melania Trump wore a Ralph Lauren cashmere dress and high-neck cropped jacket in a baby blue hue that conjured the image of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and all the fashionable prestige her image evokes.\n\nBut the tradition of making a statement through clothing goes back to 1912, when Helen Taft donated her gown from the inaugural ball to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Since then the museum has collected each inaugural ensemble for its First Ladies collection, giving their sartorial choices additional longevity and gravity as they are kept on view for the public.\n\nBelow are some of the first ladies whose inauguration outfits held deep symbolism \u2014 and sometimes, invited controversy.\n\nCaroline Harrison\n\nElevating American fashion is now expected when it comes to dressing the first family \u2014 with Ralph Lauren becoming the first designer to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this month, following a long history of dressing presidents and first ladies. But this statement of national pride can be traced as far back as 1889, when, according to the Smithsonian, first lady Caroline Harrison made a tacit declaration when she opted for an inaugural ball look that was fully made in America in order to support President Benjamin Harrison\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d economic platform, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nCaroline Harrison in her all-American made gown. Charles Parker/Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site\n\nIt was a multistate effort, with a gown from Ghormley, Robes et Manteaux in New York City, its brocaded silk fabric sourced from the Logan Silk Company in the Finger Lakes further north, and its pattern of burr oaks \u2014 a tribute to the former president William Henry Harrison, Benjamin\u2019s grandfather \u2014 designed by Indiana artist Mary Williamson.\n\nMamie Eisenhower\n\nMamie Eisenhower knew the power of the press (and the judiciousness of hype). In 1953, despite calls from the newspapers to release the details of her inauguration dress, she intentionally held her press release and photos until the week before, according to the Smithsonian.\n\nMamie Eisenhower in her first inaugural dress in 1953. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn 1957, she included subtle self-promotion on her purse. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe Nettie Rosenstein-designed dress featured more than 2,000 hand-sewn rhinestones, and was accompanied by matching opera gloves, a rhinestone-encrusted bag, and a triple-strand choker of pearls. The color of her gown was a shade she\u2019d become known for \u2014 as the press release described it, \u201ca delicate, yet definite Renoir pink.\u201d Eisenhower\u2019s soft pink gown made another appearance, too, but rendered in paint; for her official portrait by Thomas Edgar Stevens, she posed in the dress next to an accent of spring blooms.\n\nFor her husband\u2019s second term, Eisenhower included a bit of self-promotion beyond the press release: She accessorized her glitzy pearl-, crystal- and topaz-embroidered gown (also by Rosenstein) with a bag featuring the letter \u201cM\u201d on one side and \u201c1957\u201d on the other.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis\n\nJackie Kennedy was not the first in her role to see fashion as a tool for soft power, but she is remembered for wielding it so efficiently. Though traditionally the evening\u2019s inaugural ball was the place for making a grand entrance, Kennedy\u2019s most notable choice of the day was her pillbox hat: a modern, elegant silhouette in an arresting powder blue by then-emerging milliner Halston. The first lady\u2019s sartorial choices throughout the day, including the off-white silk chiffon sleeveless gown with a matching cape worn to the evening ball itself, solidified her as a new force in the fashion world and supported John F. Kennedy\u2019s vision of a new, transformative era for the presidency.\n\nJackie Kennedy's gown for the inaugural ball was designed for her by Oleg Cassini. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nBut some of the hallmarks of her looks that day were not as intended \u2014 her hat and coat from the day were not actually blue, but a more neutral tone, and may have been a color-correction issue from Life magazine, CNN reported in 2020. The shape of her hat had a happy accident as well, with a small dent that appeared as Kennedy was adjusting it widely replicated in homages to her look.\n\nLady Bird Johnson\n\nAs first lady, Lady Bird Johnson was the first to take a more active role during the presidential oath of office, holding the bible for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 \u2014 a choice that has since become tradition. She had already been first lady for more than a year, but the president\u2019s first inauguration had swiftly and grimly taken place on Air Force One in the hours following John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nJohnson didn't just plan her outfit for the inauguration, but for its exhibition display following the event. Glasshouse Images/Shutterstock\n\nIn pictures from the 1965 event, Johnson stands out in striking red among a sea of mostly black suits. But it\u2019s her vivid yellow satin gown and sable-trimmed coat from that evening that has become one of the most memorable inauguration day looks.\n\nThat was intentional, as Johnson considered the dress\u2019s second life in the Smithsonian exhibit when making her choice, according to the museum. The John Moore-designed look was chosen for its straightforward design and materials that she believed would age well in an institutional setting.\n\nRosalynn Carter\n\nCelebrities and public figures today who resurface looks at different events are often lauded for their sustainably-minded choices \u2014 including Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex; Jane Fonda and Cate Blanchett. But Rosalynn Carter, an early adopter of the trend, did not receive the same reception when she recycled her Mary Matise-designed gold-trimmed gown to the inaugural ball in 1977 following Jimmy Carter\u2019s oath of office. She\u2019d worn the gown to his inaugural ball six years earlier when he was elected governor of Georgia, and her resourceful style choice was meant to be a meaningful nod to his accomplishments. But the press (and beyond) criticized the decision.\n\nRosalynn Carter was prescient but unappreciated at the time for her show of sustainable style. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\n\u201cShe wanted to continue the tradition and wear it when (Carter) was inaugurated president,\u201d Edith Mayo, then-curator of the First Ladies exhibit, told PBS in 2001. \u201cBut the fashion community distinctly did not get that and they did not like it.\u201d\n\nNancy Reagan\n\nFollowing Rosalynn Carter\u2019s tenure, Nancy Reagan set her intentions in 1981 with an expensive white one-shoulder beaded and lace sheath gown at the inaugural ball. It was \u201ca declaration that fashion mattered,\u201d the New York Times wrote in the obituary of its designer, her longtime collaborator James Galanos. Paired with white opera gloves and her hair in a polished French pleat, the incoming first lady channeled poise and luxury \u2014 though she, too, could not escape criticism from the press, this time for having extravagant tastes.\n\nNancy Reagan\u2019s glamorous one-shoulder gown signaled a high-fashion shift. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn her outerwear earlier in the day, Reagan introduced the hue she would be most closely associated with during her husband\u2019s two terms: Reagan red, which she wore for his second inauguration as well four years later.\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nThroughout her two terms as first lady, Michelle Obama consistently raised the profiles of emerging American designers, choosing homegrown talent who deeply aligned with her values \u2014 and she began with Jason Wu, who designed her one-shouldered white gown adorned with florals and crystals for the 2009 inaugural ball. But it was an accessory earlier in the day, paired with her sparkling Isabel Toledo coat, that caught the attention of the public: her sage green J. Crew gloves, which was interpreted by many as an early symbol of her relatable for-the-people approach to politics.\n\nMichelle Obama thoughtfully selected her designer looks for the day, but it was her humble gloves that grabbed the most attention. Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe former first lady began her tenure elevating early-career American designers \u2014 which she continues to do today. Elise Amendola/AP\n\nObama\u2019s J. Crew outing was not an isolated incident, but the start of a long love affair with their off-the-rack finds. In 2017, Time acknowledged her thriftiness as a J. Crew aficionada, saying: \u201cWomen across the nation could relate to the First Lady\u2019s affinity for a cute sweater and a good deal.\u201d",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA major winter storm slammed the US Gulf Coast Tuesday, blanketing parts of a region largely unaccustomed to extreme winter weather with record-breaking snowfall.\n\nThe storm impacted 1,500 miles of the Deep South from the Texas Gulf Coast to the Atlantic coast of the Carolinas, causing widespread closures and travel disruptions, including stranded motorists and thousands of canceled flights.\n\nThe storm, along with the brutal cold that helped cause it, is blamed for at least 11 deaths.\n\nThe snowfall that dazzled Southerners unaccustomed to significant accumulation is over, but the cold is sticking around and keeping slippery conditions in place. Many cities are begging residents to avoid driving as the sun melts snow that then refreezes, increasing the danger on roadways.\n\nA beach walker heads to the ocean on Isle of Palms, South Carolina, Wednesday after a winter storm dropped ice and snow. Mic Smith/AP\n\nIn New Orleans, which saw record snowfall and frigid temperatures, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Wednesday the city is focusing on response and recovery.\n\n\u201cThe city has been through challenging situations before,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cThrough the dedication and tireless efforts of our people, we will get through this history snow event.\u201d\n\nCity crews in New Orleans are working to clear bridges and roads while warning residents should still shelter in place.\n\nSnowfall records broken\n\nMultiple locations in Florida recorded enough snow to preliminarily shatter the state\u2019s all-time snowfall record of 4 inches set in 1954.\n\nMore than a foot of snow fell in Louisiana, the high mark from the storm.\n\nNew Orleans shattered its modern all-time daily snowfall record on Tuesday, receiving 8 inches of snow, far surpassing the previous record of 2.7 inches. The city has recorded more snowfall this month than Anchorage, Alaska, which has seen nearly two inches in January. The Big Easy typically sees measurable snow only about once per decade.\n\nOther Southern cities also broke long-standing snowfall records:\n\nMobile, Alabama, reported 7.5 inches, exceeding the previous 3.6-inch record from 1973.\n\nPensacola, Florida, recorded 7.6 inches, surpassing its 2.3-inch record from 1954.\n\nMilton, Florida, recorded the most snow in Florida: a preliminary total of 10 inches\n\nThe Mobile Civic Center roof collapsed under the weight of heavy snow Wednesday morning. \u201cThe collapse occurred in a manner consistent with the plans for the building\u2019s ongoing demolition,\u201d the city said in a social media post. No one was injured.\n\nDeadly conditions\n\nNationwide, at least 11 deaths have been reported due to the severe cold affecting large parts of the country and the winter storm. On Tuesday, at least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions in Zavala County, Texas, Sheriff Eusevio Salinas told CNN. Four of the victims were ejected from their vehicle as it wrecked on a bridge. Wednesday morning, a woman was also killed when a minivan she was in collided with a tractor-trailer on US Highway 57 east of La Pryor, Texas, Salinas said.\n\nA 27-year-old woman died in Ozark, Alabama, after her car slid on a snow-covered highway Tuesday and hit a pickup truck head-on after crossing the center line, according to the Dale County Coroner\u2019s Office and Ozark Police Department.\n\nAuthorities are also investigating two deaths in Austin as potentially cold-related, though the medical examiner\u2019s office has not confirmed the causes. In Georgia, officials reported one hypothermia-related death, noting the individual had been outside the previous night.\n\nPeople walk as snow falls in New Orleans Tuesday. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nWhile the wintry storm has had a visceral impact on the Gulf region, below-freezing temperatures are also affecting much of the US. An 80-year-old man in Milwaukee is suspected to have died from hypothermia after falling outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nBelow-freezing weather helped law enforcement in Oklahoma catch a fugitive. A man accused of slamming a vehicle into a Pottawatomie County Sheriff\u2019s deputy\u2019s cruiser during a pursuit and then leading authorities on a foot chase was caught less than three hours later, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThe chase ended after the suspect entered a stranger\u2019s home and asked them to call the sheriff because he had decided it was too cold to stay on the run, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN affiliate KOCO.\n\nAs temperatures plunged below freezing this week, the plight of those experiencing homelessness became increasingly dire.\n\nIn San Antonio, Mariah Pena and Daniel Vertiz felt the weight of this reality when Pena found a woman seeking refuge in their dog kennel on the porch Sunday, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. Startled yet desperate, the woman explained that she had nowhere else to turn.\n\nThough the couple hesitated to invite a stranger into their home, they felt an imperative to help, thinking that even a makeshift shelter would offer respite from the life-threatening cold. \u201cWho knows what could have happened if she were left out on the streets?\u201d Vertiz told the outlet.\n\nThere were about 1,300 people using warming shelters in Houston Wednesday morning, Mary Benton with the Houston mayor\u2019s office told CNN. The two largest centers were filled, but Houston Mayor John Whitmire said no one was turned away. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in weather like this as reaching capacity,\u201d Whitmire said Wednesday.\n\nTwo warming centers in New Orleans quickly reached capacity on Wednesday causing the city to open a third. Mobile Crisis Units and the health department are working to transport people to the newly opened center, a city spokesperson said.\n\nAirport disruptions\n\nAirports in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida closed Tuesday due to unprecedented snowfall. Issues from the closures rippled into Wednesday.\n\nMore than 1,800 flights have been canceled nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon, primarily affecting routes to and from Texas and Louisiana along with Atlanta, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, according to FlightAware.\n\nIn Mississippi, Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport closed its terminal and runway until conditions improved. Jacksonville International Airport reopened at noon on Wednesday, while Tallahassee International, Mobile Regional and Mobile International Airports will remain closed until midday Thursday, due to \u201congoing weather conditions,\u201d Wednesday updates said. Lafayette Regional Airport in Louisiana also remained shut down due to icy conditions.\n\nAll departing flights at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport were canceled Wednesday, but flights resumed at both of Houston\u2019s major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby.\n\nWidespread road closures\n\nWith cold weather conditions across the region this week, roads could remain hazardous as snow melts and refreezes.\n\nIn Louisiana, Interstate 10 from the Louisiana/Texas state line to Baton Rouge \u2013 a roughly 150-mile stretch \u2013 was closed in both directions due to \u201cdeteriorating road conditions\u201d Wednesday, according to the state Department of Transportation and Development. Nearly 30 state roadways were closed as of Tuesday, including the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway \u2013 the nation\u2019s longest bridge over water.\n\nTo help treat roads, New Orleans has hired 14 snow plows from an Indiana-based company, Collin Arnold, the city director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, told reporters Tuesday. The initial focus will be on clearing critical routes, while crews will tackle main thoroughfares, he said.\n\nA car drives on a snowy road in Tallahassee, Florida. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, roads in Alabama\u2019s Escambia, Mobile and Baldwin counties were deemed \u201cimpassable\u201d and closed due to the storm\u2019s impact, officials said.\n\nNineteen counties in Mississippi were still reporting ice on roads and bridges Wednesday morning, with black ice remaining a significant threat, the Mississippi Department of Transportation said on social media. \u201cUntil the sun warms us up enough to thaw things down today, please only drive if it\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\n\nThe Georgia State Patrol responded to more than 100 vehicle crashes in a 14-hour period, the Department of Public Safety said. Metro-Atlanta\u2019s DeKalb County declared a state of emergency Wednesday morning after \u201chundreds\u201d of 911 calls and over 100 vehicles became stranded on icy roadways, with many obstructing emergency response efforts.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly unusual winter weather event impacting nearly three-quarters of the state and our crews cannot be everywhere at once,\u201d Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said. \u201cGeorgia DOT will need time, ability to access the roads to treat or plow, and warmer temperatures working in our favor to help restore and maintain passable conditions.\u201d\n\nCNN Meteorologists Mary Gilbert and Brandon Miller and CNN\u2019s Alexandra Skores, Lauren Mascarenhas, Jamiel Lynch, Karina Tsui and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",

Georgia officials reported one death from hypothermia at a news conference Tuesday, saying the individual was outside the night prior. Another death is also believed to have been caused by hypothermia, involving an 80-year-old man in Milwaukee who fell outdoors early Sunday, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. At least five people died in a vehicle accident caused by icy conditions early Tuesday morning in Zavala County, Texas, according to CNN affiliate WOAI/KABB, citing authorities.\n\n\u2022 Record snowfall: Snow is falling from southeast Texas through Louisiana and into parts of Mississippi and Alabama Tuesday, creating treacherous conditions. An area stretching from Houston into Alabama has recorded widespread snowfall of 3 to 6 inches, with at least one locale hitting the double-digit mark. Eight inches of snowfall was recorded at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Tuesday according to the National Weather Service in New Orleans; the previous modern record was 2.7 inches in 1963. Florida has likely broken its all-time statewide snow record, with at least 5.5 inches recorded in Molino \u2013 a record that has stood since 1954. Mobile, Alabama, has so far recorded more than five inches of snow, breaking a 143-year-old record for one-day snowfall. A record amount of snow is forecast for New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast.\n\n\u2022 Unprecedented blizzard warning issued: Heavy snow and strong wind gusts combined to create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana, where snow totals of 3 to 6 inches are already widespread. It prompted the first-ever blizzard warning anywhere along the Gulf Coast from the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, for parts of southern Louisiana and far eastern Texas.\n\nSNOW in HOUSTON! \ud83e\udd0d\u2744\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/HoYn62z35n \u2014 University of Houston (@UHouston) January 21, 2025\n\n\u2022 Widespread closures: Snow has closed or hindered operations at multiple airports in the South, contributing to the more than 2,300 flight cancellations into or out of US airports Tuesday \u2013 and more than 900 cancellations so far Wednesday. Large sections of Interstate 10 \u2014 the Gulf Coast\u2019s major thoroughfare \u2014 in Texas and Louisiana are closed Tuesday as snow and some icy mix make travel difficult to impossible. Major roads were closed across the New Orleans area. Schools and government offices are closed Tuesday throughout the Gulf Coast and states of emergency are active in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi.\n\n\u2022 Bitter cold: Low temperatures and wind chills from the Canadian border to the Mexican border are hitting dangerous levels for the second consecutive day. Wind chills Tuesday morning dropped into the teens for much of the Gulf Coast with single-digit values in northern Texas.\n\nSnow accumulates as winds gust in Lake Charles, Louisiana, early Tuesday morning. Jeremy A. Stevens\n\n\u2018Generational winter storm\u2019 hitting the South\n\nBrutally cold temperatures are allowing an incredibly unusual storm to unfold along the Gulf Coast.\n\nSnow, and an icy mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain, expanded in the early hours of Tuesday and ramped up throughout the morning. Snow even covered sandy beaches along Texas\u2019 coast Tuesday morning.\n\nThe sweeping system is \u201ca generational winter storm event,\u201d the National Weather Service said Monday \u2014 and urged those along its path to take it seriously.\n\nRoads overnight and Tuesday will be \u201cextremely hazardous if not impossible for much of the area, and travel is highly discouraged,\u201d the service said.

Visit Galveston/San Luis Hotel\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp warned people in the state to stay off roads because the sudden onset of snow later in the day, in places like Atlanta, could catch people off guard. Indeed, there were impacts to the roadways by early evening, particularly south of Interstate 20, according to Georgia Department of Transportation spokesperson Natalie Dale. \u201cPlow crews are having trouble treating some areas due to non-incident related congestion,\u201d she said, encouraging motorists to avoid travel.\n\n\u201cThis could deteriorate very quickly like it did in 2014,\u201d Gov. Kemp said. A few inches of snow that year paralyzed Atlanta with countless traffic incidents that trapped drivers in what became known as \u201cSnowmageddon.\u201d\n\nThe rare winter storm comes as 33 million people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina under winter weather alerts, with more than 200 million people in the US affected by bitterly cold air more broadly. The Upper Midwest and Northern Plains recorded wind chills to 50 degrees below zero Monday and were experiencing 40 degrees below zero Tuesday morning \u2014 temperatures that can cause frostbite on exposed skin in a matter of minutes.\n\nAir and road travel halted; schools shut down\n\nOfficials in affected states in the South cautioned people to stay off the roads, keep faucets dripping to prevent pipes from freezing, check batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes.\n\nGovernors in Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi have declared states of emergency, while Texas authorities have directed state agencies to mobilize resources for the rare snowfall. In North Carolina, officials have deployed parts of the state National Guard to the eastern reaches of the state to support local emergency services.\n\n\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,\u201d Louisiana climatologist Jay Grymes said Monday.\n\nTravel was paralyzed along the Interstate 10 corridor with portions already receiving widespread snowfall totals of 3 to 6 inches. More than half a foot of snow had fallen by Tuesday afternoon along a portion of I-10 in southwestern Louisiana. One location just north of Rayne, Louisiana, recorded 10.5 inches of snow before noon. Cold weather will lock any snow and ice that falls into place, keeping roads hazardous.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon, the Louisiana State Patrol had responded to more than 50 weather-related calls for service and numerous crashes across the state.\n\nSimilar warnings were echoed in neighboring Florida. \u201cOur infrastructure is designed differently than states that are used to this (winter weather),\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned in a Tuesday news conference. \u201cThe state has done a lot to prepare but \u2026 driving in icy conditions, it can be very, very hazardous.\u201d\n\nCars travel on a snow-covered highway Tuesday in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP\n\nDisruptions were also reported in the skies, with more than a dozen airports in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia closed to commercial flights as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThere were more than 2,300 flight cancellations within, into or out of the US Tuesday morning, with most of those flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Nearly all flights to or from New Orleans International Airport were canceled by 10 a.m. CST.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Lafayette Regional Airport was closed Tuesday due to ice and snow on runways, the airport said. Mississippi\u2019s Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport also closed its terminal and runway \u201cuntil weather permits a safe reopening.\u201d The Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama closed around 9:15 a.m. CT, spokesperson Devon Calametti told CNN, with plans to reopen at noon Wednesday.\n\nIn Florida, Tallahassee International Airport said it would suspend all operations at 4 p.m. CT with plans to reopen Wednesday at noon. And Jacksonville International Airport will close after its last departing flight Tuesday evening, around 8 p.m. Again, the airport plans to reopen at noon Wednesday.\n\nHouston\u2019s two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby, are also closed Tuesday, while Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest, is pretreating roadways and airfield surfaces in preparation for the winter weather, according to spokesperson Andrew Gobeil.\n\nSchools across the Deep South were closed or moved online Tuesday from Texas to Florida. In Georgia, Gwinnett County Public Schools, the state\u2019s largest school district, has moved all its classes online. The Houston Independent School District, the largest in the Lone Star state and the eighth largest in the country, will also be closed until Wednesday.\n\nLesley Martin and her 4-year-old daughter Layla Richardson walk on a snow covered street in New Orleans Tuesday morning.

Jeff Landry said Monday during a news conference about storm preparations.\n\n\u201cThis is the time when you can cook you a big pot of gumbo,\u201d Landry said.\n\nOfficials in affected states urged people to stay off the roads, keep a trickle of water running through faucets to keep pipes from freezing, check the batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and refrain from using cooking stoves to heat homes. The precautions are more familiar to people living in northern climates but rare in the South.\n\n\u201cMost of us haven\u2019t experienced this combination of bitter cold and significant snow ever in our lifetime,\u201d Louisiana climatologist Jay Grymes said Monday.\n\nA National Weather Service forecast warned, \u201cthis should be considered a generational winter storm event and its impacts should be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nTravel could be snarled for days\n\nThe forecast has already prompted more than 1,700 flight cancellations Tuesday, with a majority of the flights coming from Texas and Louisiana, according to the tracking website FlightAware.\n\nHouston\u2019s major airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Hobby Airport will be closed Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been convinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode,\u201d John Whitmire, the mayor of Houston, said at a Sunday news conference.\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest airport, is pretreating roadways and airfield surfaces in preparation for the winter weather, according to spokesperson Andrew Gobeil.\n\n\u201cThe Emergency Operations Center will activate at 6 a.m. Tuesday morning and will remain operational throughout the event,\u201d Gobeil said Monday. \u201cPassengers are urged to arrive in the airport at least two and a half hours prior to domestic departure times unless otherwise directed by their airlines.\u201d\n\nThe snow is expected to fall along the Interstate 10 and Interstate 20 corridors, prompting highway officials to warn motorists of the possibility of road closures in the next few days, in areas where many drivers are not used to driving on snow.\n\nNASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston said it will be closed Tuesday and Wednesday due to the extreme weather. Port Houston said its facilities will be closed on Tuesday as well.\n\nSchools are closed in several states including Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The Houston Independent School District, which is the largest in the state and the eighth largest in the country, will also be closed until Wednesday, Whitmire said.\n\nAtlanta Public Schools, which serves about 50,000 students, said its schools and district offices will be closed Tuesday.\n\nA man clears a walkway outside a Denver home on Monday amid temperatures in the single digits.

The wind chill hit 57 degrees below zero in Rolla, North Dakota, Monday morning. Wind chills this low can cause frostbite on exposed skin in less than 5 minutes.\n\nAn 80-year-old man died in Milwaukee following a fall outdoors early Sunday morning in what\u2019s being investigated as a \u201cprobable hypothermia death,\u201d according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. Milwaukee\u2019s low temperature Sunday morning reached zero with wind chills in the teens below zero.\n\nAcross the northern US, multiple cities, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit, New York City, Washington, DC, Boston and Philadelphia could go days without seeing a high temperature climb above freezing.\n\nSouthern cities like Houston, Atlanta, Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, could also see highs below freezing Monday or Tuesday. This prolonged period of cold temperatures could cause pipes to burst.\n\nLow temperatures could fall to record levels last set in the 1930s by Wednesday morning in Houston, Austin and San Antonio, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nCold weather alerts span much of the US Monday afternoon. CNN Weather\n\nHistoric snow on the way for the South\n\nIn addition to the extreme cold, large sections of the Interstate 10 and Interstate 20 corridors stretching from central Texas through northern Florida could record accumulating snow rarely seen in the region.\n\nMessy wintry weather will begin Monday evening in Central Texas and pick up in both intensity and expanse overnight. Snow, sleet and freezing rain will stretch from coastal Texas to Louisiana and Mississippi by sunrise Tuesday. This hazardous mix will expand east into the rest of the Southeast Tuesday and reach parts of the Carolinas Tuesday night.\n\nWidespread snow totals of 1 to 3 inches will accumulate from southeast Texas \u2014 including Houston \u2014 through southern Louisiana and into parts of southern Georgia and coastal South Carolina from Monday night into Wednesday morning. Totals greater than 3 inches are possible, mainly in far southeast Texas and in parts of southern Louisiana \u2014 including Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\n\nNew Orleans hasn\u2019t recorded measurable snow \u2014 meaning at least 0.1 inch \u2014 since 2009, and has never recorded more than 3 inches of snow. The city\u2019s all-time snowiest day on record dates to 1963, when 2.7 inches fell.\n\nGusty winds could combine with heavy snow at times Tuesday and potentially create whiteout conditions in southern Louisiana. If these whiteout conditions last long enough, it could prompt the region\u2019s first blizzard warning on record.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) something I never thought I\u2019d have to say in this part of the world, but blizzard conditions are certainly within reach for some areas,\u201d said Donald Jones, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\nMeasurable snow has only happened a dozen times at Houston\u2019s Hobby Airport since 1932, most recently in February 2021. The most snow to fall in a single day at the site is 4.4 inches set in February 1960.\n\nPensacola, Florida, could record its first measurable snow since 2014 with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain on the way. If measurable snow coats the ground anywhere in Florida, as it\u2019s forecast to do, it\u2019ll be the first winter since 2010 that all 50 states have had measurable snow.\n\nFreezing rain will increase travel danger. It\u2019s possible over much of northern Florida and parts of southern Georgia and South Carolina. Any amount of ice is dangerous, especially for a region so unaccustomed to it.\n\nModerate-to-major impacts are likely along the Gulf Coast as a result of this storm, according to NOAA\u2019s Winter Storm Severity Index.

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMost of the United States is being assailed with extreme winter weather this week as Arctic air blasts south from Canada, snow tracks up the Northeast coast and a potentially crippling winter storm takes aim at the South.\n\nTravelers are facing delays Sunday and cold is in store for much of the nation, with more than 75% of the US expected to face freezing temperatures this week.\n\nOver 70 million people are under winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings from Tennessee to Maine on Sunday. That means snow for many Northeast cities, as a low-pressure system will bring a quick shot of snow to the I-95 corridor from Virginia to Maine on Sunday through early Monday.\n\nWashington, DC, is expected to see 1 to 3 inches of snow, with up to 6 inches expected in New York and Boston. Hartford, Connecticut, could see 5 to 7 inches of snow and Portland, Maine, could receive up to 8 inches. And in Philadelphia, where a snow emergency was declared Sunday evening, there could be 4-6 inches of snow and below freezing temperatures Sunday night.\n\nA cold weather emergency has been activated in Washington, DC, mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a Sunday post on X. The mayor warned of \u201cdangerously low\u201d temperatures overnight. The frosty forecast prompted the announcement that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration will be held indoors on Monday, the first inside presidential inauguration since Ronald Reagan in 1985.\n\nAt least 1,100 flights into or out of the US were canceled by Sunday evening with another 5,017 delayed, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Over 20% of flights into or out of Newark Liberty International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled, the site shows.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency due to the storm.\n\n\u201cAs always, I urge all New Jerseyans to use caution, follow all safety protocols, and remain off the roads unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Murphy said on X Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the South is bracing for a rare winter storm with a still-uncertain forecast. Louisiana declared a state of emergency and Texas has directed state agencies to mobilize resources due to the threat of snow.\n\nIn Houston, Texas, both civilian airports will be closed all day on Tuesday, mayor John Whitmire announced at a Sunday evening news conference. Schools in the Houston Independent School District \u2014 the largest in the state and the eighth-largest in the country \u2014 will also be closed until Wednesday, Whitmire said.\n\nThe city could see up to 5 inches of snow starting Monday night, according to National Weather Service Houston, which warned of \u201cfreezing rain\u201d and icy roads making for dangerous travel conditions into midday Wednesday. Below-freezing overnight temperatures are expected to continue from Sunday through Friday, says the agency.\n\nDangerous cold for millions\n\nArctic air spreads across much of the US this week, and for some states, the extreme cold could last for days. Nearly 150 million people are under cold weather alerts with forecasters warning of potential frozen pipes, frostbite and travel delays.\n\nMore than two dozen record lows are possible this week including in Cleveland, Kansas City, and Houston as temperatures will drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal.\n\nDenver is forecast to have a high temperature of only 9 degrees Monday, a staggering 36 degrees cooler than their normal high of 45.\n\nSouthern cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Memphis and Birmingham may not even reach a high temperature above freezing Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAn extended period of freezing temperatures could cause ruptured water pipes,\u201d the National Weather Service in Atlanta warned.\n\nHouston\u2019s mayor similarly urged residents to protect their water pipes before the frigid temperatures hit. \u201cLet me emphasize the preparation of your pipes,\u201d Whitmire said Sunday. \u201cWrap your pipes if all possible.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said that he was \u201cconvinced that we are about to experience a very serious and dangerous weather episode.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents to stay inside, to check on vulnerable neighbors and family members, and to utilize one of the city\u2019s 24-hour warming centers. Officials are doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to encourage homeless people to seek refuge in warming centers, he added.\n\nWind is also a huge factor in the cold. Wind speeds of 15 to 25 mph, along with the already very cold temperatures, will lead to wind chills of minus 25 to 50 below zero at times from Sunday to Tuesday across the Midwest and Northern Plains. These conditions could cause frostbite on exposed skin in less than 10 minutes.\n\n\u2018Rare, significant winter storm\u2019 for South\n\nMore than 30 million people from Texas to Georgia are under winter storm watches in preparation for a rare winter storm across the Gulf Coast and Southeast this week.\n\nThe impacts from the significant storm will begin in Texas on Monday, the Weather Prediction Center said, adding that major traffic and travel disruptions are likely through mid-week.\n\nA wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected near and south of the Interstate 20 corridor with potentially heavy snow or sleet in some areas. The sleet and freezing rain could stretch as far south as the Interstate 10 corridor.\n\nThe latest forecast shows the potential for at least 3 inches of snow in Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana; Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Macon, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama and Houston, Texas.\n\nIce accumulations could also lead to power outages and downed trees.",

                "text": "CNN \u2014\n\n\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d Donald Trump said Monday as he signed an executive order \u2013 one of dozens during his first hours as president \u2013 to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization.\n\nWhat lies behind the move, and what could the impact be? WHO, the United Nations health agency that helps protect the health and security of the world\u2019s people, receives about a fifth of its budget from the US.\n\nTrump has blasted WHO as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and accused it of ripping America off, and millions of Americans who voted for him are increasingly skeptical of the value of such international structures. But experts have warned that the withdrawal of WHO\u2019s most influential member could harm global health.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the organization said it regretted the US decision, noting that it had, \u201cover the past 7 years implemented the largest set of reforms in its history, to transform our accountability, cost-effectiveness, and impact in countries.\u201d\n\nThe US withdrawal is the \u201cmost momentous\u201d of all the executive orders signed Monday, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University, warning it \u201ccould be sowing the seeds for the next pandemic.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s decision could affect WHO and global health more widely.\n\nWhat does WHO do?\n\nWHO is one of several global institutions that emerged from the wreckage of World War II. After the world was torn apart by nationalism and conflict, countries agreed to sacrifice some aspects of their sovereignty for the common good.\n\nThe agency was founded in 1948 in an attempt to protect the world\u2019s health. Its constitution, signed by all UN members at the time, warned that \u201cunequal development\u201d in the health systems of different countries was a \u201ccommon danger.\u201d The organization\u2019s objective is \u201cthe attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health.\u201d\n\nThomas Parran, then the US surgeon general, said WHO was more than a health agency, but a \u201cpowerful instrument forged for peace\u201d that would \u201ccontribute to the harmony of human relations.\u201d\n\nToday, the agency works in more than 150 locations around the world, leads efforts to expand universal health coverage and directs the international response to health emergencies, from yellow fever to cholera and Ebola.\n\nThe agency has, however, been criticized for being inefficient, opaque, overly reliant on private donors and hamstrung by political concerns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Decline in global vaccination rate \u2018is very concerning,\u2019 says WHO Chief 14:15 - Source: CNN Decline in global vaccination rate \u2018is very concerning,\u2019 says WHO Chief 14:15\n\nWhat has it achieved?\n\nWHO\u2019s most notable achievement was the eradication of smallpox, which marked a rare instance of cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1967, the organization set the ambitious target of wiping out the disease in a decade. The last known case was in Somalia in 1977. By 1980, WHO could declare smallpox eradicated \u2013 the only infectious disease to achieve this distinction.\n\nBecause the organization is so large, its effects are often \u201cdiffuse,\u201d said Francois Balloux, director of the Genetics Institute at University College London (UCL). He pointed to the near-universal upward trend in life expectancy since WHO\u2019s founding as an achievement for which the agency also deserves credit.\n\nMore recently, it has led responses to disease outbreaks like Ebola in West Africa, which killed at least 11,000 of the more than 28,000 people infected from 2014-2016. Working with local authorities, WHO conducted research on the safety of a newly developed vaccine \u2013 which achieved near-perfect efficacy and helped stem the spread of the disease.\n\nTrump holds an executive order after signing it at an inauguration event in Washington, DC, on Monday. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nWhy does Trump want to withdraw?\n\nTrump first tried to exit WHO during his first term in 2020, accusing the organization of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the spread of Covid-19.\n\nTrump has long said he believes the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, which Beijing has sought to obscure. Notably, WHO has shared some of Trump\u2019s concerns and in December \u2013 five years since the first case of Covid-19 was detected \u2013 called for China to be more transparent to help the world understand how the pandemic began.\n\nDuring his latest election campaign, Trump was more brazen, calling the organization \u201cnothing more than a corrupt globalist scam\u201d which \u201cdisgracefully covered the tracks of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nBy focusing on the origins of Covid-19, Trump has understated the role that WHO \u2013 spearheaded by the US \u2013 played in combating the virus once it began to spread, experts say.\n\nAlan Bernstein, director of the Global Health initiative at the University of Oxford, said WHO was crucial in convincing China to release the genetic sequence early in 2020, which was the basis of the vaccines developed in the US.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fight a pandemic effectively without some kind of global table where countries around the world can meet and discuss and twist arms to release data,\u201d Bernstein told CNN.\n\nThere is also a financial aspect to Trump\u2019s animosity. The president has previously said that the US contributes around $500 million a year to WHO, compared to China\u2019s $40 million, despite its far larger population.\n\nAs he signed Monday\u2019s executive order, Trump was asked whether, as president during Covid-19, he appreciated the importance of agencies like WHO.\n\n\u201cI do, but not when you\u2019re being ripped off like we are,\u201d he replied.\n\nThis worldview misses the benefits of cooperation, said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n\u201cThe US would be weaker in its national security imperatives if it wasn\u2019t part of WHO, given it wouldn\u2019t have this cooperation with other countries to know what\u2019s happening in terms of outbreaks and in helping manage response,\u201d Sridhar told CNN.\n\nTedros attends a press conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 10, 2024. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIt takes a year to withdraw fully from the agency \u2013 which is why Joe Biden was able to halt the US exit four years ago, in one of the first acts of his presidency.\n\nBut there are signs that the departure could be swifter this time. Monday\u2019s executive order called on the secretary of state and director of the Office of Management and Budget to pause funding \u201cwith all practicable speed.\u201d\n\nPerhaps anticipating Trump\u2019s exit, WHO launched a request earlier this month for $1.5 billion in funding to address 42 ongoing health emergencies. The organization declined to make that connection on a call with reporters on Friday, just days before Trump took office.\n\nTedros said Tuesday that he \u201cregrets\u201d Trump\u2019s decision, stressing that the US also gains from the agency to which it contributes.\n\n\u201cFor over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and benefited from membership in WHO,\u201d Tedros said.\n\nBalloux, of UCL, said the decision could delay the eradication of polio and hamper efforts to combat tuberculosis and HIV.\n\n\u201cIt could lead to delayed responses to major outbreaks of things we know about, like Ebola, and things we don\u2019t know about yet,\u201d he told CNN.",

I think there's a new sense of leadership over there. Qatar was enormously helpful in this. Sheikh Mohammed, plenty of his communication skills with Hamas were indispensable here, so I think the UAE is already a part of it. Egypt was very helpful to us in these endeavors.\"\n\n\"I think we have the opportunity to get everybody bought in to a better future for the region \u2013 more opportunity, more hope,\" he added.\n\nISRAEL-HAMAS CEASE-FIRE DEAL OFFICIALLY SIGNED BY NEGOTIATORS IN DOHA\n\nWitkoff, a former real estate tycoon, is credited for being President Trump's man in the room during efforts to broker the complex deal that has seen the return of three female hostages thus far.\n\nAdditional phases of the deal should see more releases, though President Donald Trump is doubtful the ceasefire will hold as intended.\n\n\"I\u2019m not confident. It\u2019s not our war, it\u2019s their war,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, when asked by a reporter whether the ceasefire would hold and last through three planned phases. \"I looked at a picture of Gaza \u2013 Gaza is like a massive demolition site. That place is, it\u2019s really, it\u2019s got to be rebuilt in a different way.\"\n\n\u2018LYING TO THE NATION\u2019: TRUMP ORBIT SLAMS BIDEN FOR TAKING CREDIT FOR CEASE-FIRE DEAL\n\nWitkoff said he doesn't disagree with Trump and that the \"implementation\" of the deal will likely be more challenging than its \"execution.\"\n\n\"That was a big step\u2026. We had to get it done, and we did, thank God, and now we've got implement [it],\" he added, saying that he will be traveling to Israel to work on the implentation of the ceasefire that will hopefully lead to further hostage releases.\n\n\"I'm actually going to be going over to Israel. I'm going to be a part of an inspection team at the Netzarim corridor and also in the Philadelphi corridor. That's where you have outside overseers making sure that people are safe and people who are entering are not armed and no one has bad motivations, but we have to make sure that the implementation goes well.\n\n\"If it goes well, we'll get into phase two, and we're going to get a lot more live bodies out, and I think that's what the president's directive to me and everybody else working in the American government on this [is], and that's what we're going to do.\"",

                "text": "President Donald Trump is quickly showcasing his accessibility to reporters days after returning to the White House, a stark contrast to his Democratic predecessor who frequently ducked questions and took scripted questions from reporters.\n\n\"We'll take a few questions,\" the president said on Tuesday, after announcing what's said to be a half-trillion dollar investment by top tech companies to vastly expand the nation's artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nTrump then took questions for half an hour from reporters gathered at the White House.\n\nIt was the second straight day the new president held an informal, off-the-cuff and freewheeling news conference with reporters.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR FOX NEWS UPDATES ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nOn Monday, hours after he was inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol, Trump took questions for 45 minutes as he sat in the Oval Office and simultaneously signed an avalanche of executive orders and actions. The back and forth with reporters was carried live by Fox News and CNN.\n\nTrump on Wednesday is taking questions from Fox News' Sean Hannity, for his first Oval Office interview since returning to the White House.\n\nThe sit-down will run at 9 p.m. ET on Fox News' \"Hannity.\"\n\nFOX EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP SHARES LETTER BIDEN LEFT FOR HIM\n\n\"The president is the tip of the spear and he's been active in wanting to go out and communicate both his successes and the challenges that we have, and he's been active in wanting to solve those,\" deputy White House chief of staff for communications Taylor Budowich told Fox News.\n\nThe accessibility with reporters showcases Trump's unscripted nature, and it stands in stark contrast with former President Joe Biden, whose interactions with reporters were more limited and at times tightly stage-managed.\n\n\"Did Biden ever do news conferences like this?\" Trump asked on Monday, as he appeared to take a jab at the former president.\n\nTRUMP'S AVALANCHE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS\n\nJulie Mason, the host of a national radio program on SiriusXM, veteran White House reporter and former elected board member of the White House Correspondents Association, told Fox News \"it is completely refreshing to have a president who is accessible, available.\"\n\n\"He'll answer any question you throw at him. He's not always happy with the questions he gets, but he engages with journalists. That's the most important thing. Their job is to inform the public about what is going on at the White House and having direct access to the president is essential to that,\" the \"Julie Mason Show\" host emphasized.\n\nShe added that \"Biden was kept very much under wraps. Reporters rarely got a chance to ask him anything. It was a huge frustration in the press corps. This is completely different.\"\n\nTrump is known for his extended interactions with reporters. He held two unconstrained news conferences at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, during his transition back to the presidency.\n\nAnd while for years he has accused reporters of being \"fake news\" and \"the enemy of the people,\" and while his answers to their questions keep fact-checkers busy, his exchanges with the media are often free-flowing, without any aides selecting reporters to ask questions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBudowich says Trump's accessibility and off-the-cuff style are contributing factors to his political success.\n\n\"The reason we won this election is because of Donald Trump. The reason why we are going to succeed in executing his agenda is because of Donald Trump,\" he argued.\n\nAnd he touted that Trump \"in the first two and a half days, has accomplished what most presidents fail to accomplish in their first two years.\"",

The ability was reinstated by the Biden administration in 2021, Forbes reports.\n\nPride flags were later banned from being flown outside U.S. embassies in March 2024 as part of a $1.2 trillion spending package Biden signed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump vowed to immediately shake up the State Department upon taking office, with one source familiar with the situation telling Fox News that the new Trump administration will immediately move new officials into key operational roles at the State Department to ensure the department is carrying out the Trump foreign policy agenda from day one.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump's nominee for secretary of state, Florida Sen.

                "text": "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Wednesday unveiled a lengthy report that he says serves as a \"roadmap\" to \"Make America Healthy Again\" and points to how the flawed American healthcare system impacts \"national defense.\"\n\nThe 47-page report \u2013 titled \"The Case for Healthcare Freedom\" \u2013 is a \"painstakingly researched\" summary of \"America\u2019s health crisis and how to address it,\" Roy said.\n\nIts findings include that U.S. healthcare spending had reached $4.9 trillion in 2023.\n\nAs a share of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), health spending accounted for 17.6%, and costs are growing around 1% faster than the annual GDP, the report says.\n\nThe report argues that \"if conservatives care about a strong national defense and low taxes, these trends have to be reversed.\"\n\nMAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN: THE POWERHOUSE FOODS THAT WORK MEDICAL MAGIC\n\n\"The Case for Healthcare Freedom lays out a detailed roadmap for how Congressional Republicans can help President Trump deliver on the promise to address America's health crisis,\" Roy said in a statement. \"The problem isn't just health insurance, or Big Pharma, or food additives that are making us unhealthy; it's the fact that politicians, bureaucrats and corporations are all benefitting from a broken, cronyistic system that lets them put profits over patients with impunity.\"\n\nRoy argued that right now, Congress has \"a tremendous opportunity to put American healthcare back on track by embracing the empowerment of patients and doctors through the promotion of expansive health savings accounts in the budget reconciliation process, and we need to take full advantage.\" The congressman went on to say, \"giving the same actors more power and money won't work; if we want to Make America Healthy Again, the answer is healthcare freedom. If we want to control our budgets and healthcare spending, the answer is healthcare freedom.\"\n\nThe wide-ranging report comes just two days after President Donald Trump was sworn into a second term. The pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" became a focal point of Trump's campaign when Democrat turned Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and backed him. Trump tapped Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but his confirmation hearing has not yet been scheduled.\n\nThe report includes criticism of the program providing food welfare assistance for low-income households.\n\nFORMER TRUMP HHS OFFICIAL TAPPED TO BE RFK JR'S CHIEF OF STAFF: REPORT\n\n\n\n\"While chronic food illness kills up to 678,000 Americans per year, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will likely pay over $250 billion on junk food for the next 10 years,\" Roy's office notes.\n\nThe report also targets the coveted weight loss and diabetes drugs championed as \"miracle medication,\" which has even used by celebrities to drop pounds in recent months. It found the Danish pharmaceutical company, Novo Nordisk, \"spent at least $25.8 million over the past decade on U.S. medical professionals to promote two of its obesity drugs, Wegovy and Saxenda.\"\n\nThe report assesses that families and their employers on average in 2024 spent $25,000 annually, or nearly the cost of a company car, for health insurance, and that's despite \"the false promise of Obamacare to lower premiums by $2,500 a year.\" The cost of premiums has increased at least 100% since 2010, according to the report.\n\n\"Obamacare has made healthcare so expensive that it now subsidizes households earning up to $600,000 per year for their health insurance,\" the report says.\n\nIn 2024, the report found, four of the top five American industries by revenue were healthcare-related. Those were hospitals, which came in first; drug, cosmetics and toiletry wholesaling, which came second; health insurance, which earned the third place slot; and pharmaceutical wholesaling, which came in fifth.\n\nThe report also discusses how 47% of hospital cash prices are lower than the insurer-negotiated price \"that people pay hundreds of dollars a month for the privilege of having.\"\n\nThe report argues multiple insurance companies, including UnitedHealth, Anthem/Elevance, and Humana, \"earn\" a majority of their revenue from taxpayers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We do not have a free market in the healthcare system. The government controls more than 80% of health spending,\" according to a summary of the report provided by Roy's office. \"The Left\u2019s solution to fix our healthcare system is spending even more money and giving the government even further control over the healthcare system. \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 would cost an additional $33 trillion over 10 years, and it would leave 70% of Americans financially worse off.\"",

                "text": "President Donald Trump's first actions in the Oval Office included rolling back healthcare policies put forth by former President Joe Biden, including expansions to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as \"ObamaCare.\"\n\nDirectly after he was sworn in on Monday, Trump moved quickly to revoke a long list of Biden executive orders covering a wide range of issues. Two of the orders that were revoked included efforts by Biden to expand access to the ACA and restore the federal program \"to the way it was before Trump became president\" the first time around.\n\nThe move angered Democrats, who argued the action was an \"attack\" on the federal health insurance program.\n\n\"Donald Trump\u2019s immediate priority as president is ripping away affordable health care coverage for tens of millions of Americans and screwing over people with preexisting conditions,\" the Democratic National Committee said in a Tuesday statement.\n\nShortly after taking office in January 2021, Biden passed Executive Order 14009, titled the \"Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\" The move, which Trump rescinded as part of his Day One executive actions, doubled the window of time that uninsured Americans had to apply to participate in the federal insurance program. Under Trump's first term, the ACA's open enrollment period was six weeks long.\n\nTRUMP AND A HEALTHIER AMERICA WELCOMED BY DOCTORS: \u2018NEW GOLDEN AGE\u2019\n\nIn addition to expanding the open enrollment period, Biden's January 2021 executive order also directed all relevant federal agencies to examine their policies and implement any necessary changes to help get more people covered under the ACA.\n\nMeanwhile, in April of the following year, Biden signed a second executive order on \"Continuing to Strengthen Americans\u2019 Access to Affordable, Quality Health Coverage,\" which Trump also reversed on Monday. The April order from Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to analyze new policies aimed at \"exploring how medical debts are collected from beneficiaries,\" in order to find new ways to reduce \"the burden of medical debt on working families and individuals across the country.\"\n\nConsistent with both of these orders, agencies facilitated the expansion of the ACA through new eligibility provisions, increased funding to groups that help people sign up for the ACA, and more.\n\nOther changes enacted by Trump during his first days in office included the revocation of a Biden-era policy that directed Medicare and Medicaid to investigate how to lower drug costs. In response to that order, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a $2 cap for certain generic drugs, ensured Medicare beneficiaries did not overpay for drugs that received accelerated approval, and helped state Medicaid programs pay for certain high-cost, cutting-edge therapies. Biden's policy that capped insulin costs at $35 and implemented a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for prescription drug costs went unaffected by Trump's Day One orders.\n\nTRUMP TO DEPLOY MILITARY TO BORDER, END BIDEN PAROLE POLICIES IN FLURRY OF DAY ONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS\n\nTrump also acted during his first day in office to rescind several of Biden's COVID-19 health orders, such as directives to ensure equity in the pandemic response and COVID-19 vaccine requirements for federal workers. He withdrew the U.S. from its participation in the World Health Organization, as well.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee argued Tuesday that Trump was \"screwing over people with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump\u2019s immediate priority as president is ripping away affordable health care coverage for tens of millions of Americans,\" the DNC said in a Tuesday statement. \"Thanks to the Biden-Harris administration, more Americans have health coverage than ever before, and Trump wants to unwind this progress even though the American people overwhelmingly support the ACA. Trump\u2019s plans will do nothing but raise costs and make Americans sicker.\"\n\nYet, according to a health policy expert from Vanderbilt University, the moves Trump made on health policies will likely not be consequential when it comes to how much Americans are paying for their healthcare.\n\n\"When administrations change over, many of them want to undo some of the actions of other presidents, even when those are more symbolic,\" Dr. Stacie Dusetzina, a professor at Vanderbilt's Department of Health Policy told NBC News. \"It could mean that the Trump administration is not interested in pursuing any of the work that has since developed out of these executive orders.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Trump administration for comment, but did not receive a response by publication time.",

But if we didn't win this race, I really believe our country would have been lost forever,\" he said.\n\nHannity switched gears, pressing Trump about former President Biden pardoning members of his own family in the final minutes of his presidency.\n\n4 TRUMP RIVALS THAT BIDEN'S PARDON\n\n\"This guy went around giving everybody pardons, and, you know, the funny thing \u2014 maybe the sad thing \u2014 is he didn't give himself a pardon. And, if you look at it, it all had to do with him,\" Trump told Hannity.\n\nBiden was asked in 2020 about reports that then-President Trump was considering preemptive pardons for members of his family and even himself, describing the possibility as concerning.\n\n\"Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,\" Biden told CNN anchor Jake Tapper.\n\nFour years later, he pardoned his sister, two brothers and their spouses. Biden said the array of pardons was in part because he feared \"baseless\" and \"politically motivated investigations\" into his family from the Trump administration.\n\n\"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said in a statement released on Inauguration Day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump declined to answer Hannity's question about whether Congress should investigate the Biden family.\n\n\"Look, he didn't give himself a pardon and he didn't give some other people a pardon that needed it,\" said Trump.\n\nTune in to Part 2 of Sean Hannity's exclusive interview with President Trump on \"Hannity\" Thursday at 9 pm ET on Fox News.",

                "text": "We\u2019re quickly approaching the fourth weekend of 2025.\n\nAnd the Senate is already running behind.\n\nThis could trigger weekend Senate sessions as Senate Republicans try to accelerate the process on some of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees.\n\nSenators failed to forge a time agreement to expedite the confirmation of CIA Director nominee John Ratcliffe.\n\nSEN. THUNE SUGGESTS STAYING THROUGH WEEKEND TO CONFIRM TRUMP PICKS AFTER DEMS DELAY VOTES: 'SHOULDN'T BE HARD'\n\nSo, here are some Senate vocabulary terms for you.\n\nCloture, filibuster and ripen.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., filed \"cloture\" Tuesday to break filibusters on three nominees, starting with Ratcliffe. \"Invoking cloture\" is the parliamentary means to break a filibuster.\n\nA filibuster is in the eyes of the beholder. A filibuster could be a way to hold something up via a lengthy speech. It could be a way to just object and sidetrack the Senate\u2019s course. Or, it could be implied that senators who plan to deploy either option. Thus, the Senate Majority Leader gets the joke. He knows he must \"file cloture\" to terminate the \"filibuster.\"\n\nDemocrats appear dug in on Ratcliffe. So Thune took the procedural step of filing cloture petitions to overcome a filibuster on the the Ratcliffe nomination, but also for Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary nominee Kristi Noem.\n\nBy rule, once cloture is filed, it must \"ripen\" for a day before the Senate may consider it. Thune filed cloture on Ratcliffe Tuesday. Therefore Wednesday serves as the intervening day. The Senate could vote to break the filibuster one hour after the Senate meets on Thursday at 10 am et. By rule, the cloture vote can begin at 11 am et. That will only need 51 yeas to break the filibuster.\n\nSECOND ACTS: PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES HISTORIC COMEBACK\n\nCIA Director is not recognized as a full-level cabinet position. So the \"post cloture\" time is limited to only two hours \u2013 not the full 30 hours of debate allowed for all cabinet level slots.\n\nThus, if the Senate breaks the filibuster on Thursday, a vote to confirm Ratcliffe as CIA Director could come just two hours later. Confirmation only needs 51 votes.\n\nNext in the queue is the Hegseth nomination. And the process starts all over again.\n\nFox has learned that unless there is a time agreement to accelerate debate on nominees, it is possible that the confirmation vote on Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth could come late Friday night or in the wee hours of Saturday morning.\n\nSo let\u2019s say the Senate clears the filibuster on Ratcliffe by late morning. It debates his nomination for a couple of hours. That means the Senate could vote by 3 or 4 p.m. ET to confirm Ratcliffe.\n\nOnce Ratcliffe is confirmed, Hegseth is next. The Senate could then vote to break the filibuster on Hegseth on Thursday afternoon. If the Senate breaks the filibuster, that would then trigger up to 30 hours of debate. If all time is used, final confirmation on Hegseth could come late Friday night or early Saturday morning.\n\nHEGSETH LAWYER SLAMS 'FLAWED AND QUESTIONABLE AFFIDAVIT' FROM EX-SISTER-IN-LAW\n\nRegardless, this is where things get interesting:\n\nFox is told it\u2019s possible there could be a tie on the confirmation vote for Hegseth. It\u2019s about the math. Republicans have 53 members. Fox is told to keep an eye on Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. All have played their cards close to the vest as to their opinions on Hegseth. If they vote nay, Vice President Vance could need to come to the Capitol to break the tie and confirm Hegseth as Defense Secretary.\n\nNo vice president had ever broken a tie to confirm a cabinet secretary until former Vice President Mike Pence did so to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary on February 7, 2017. Pence also broke ties to confirm former Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., as ambassador for religious freedom in 2018. He also broke a tie to confirm current Budget Director nominee Russ Vought as Deputy Budget Director in 2018.\n\nOnce the Senate dispenses with the Hegseth nomination, it\u2019s on to a procedural vote for Noem. The Senate would need to break a filibuster on Noem\u2019s nomination. If that vote comes late Friday/early Saturday, the Senate could vote to confirm Noem midday Sunday if they burn all time. If the vote to break the filibuster on Noem comes at a \"normal\" hour Saturday (say 10 or 11 am et), the Senate doesn\u2019t vote to confirm Noem until Sunday night or Monday if all time is required.\n\nThune also filed cloture on the nomination of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent late Thursday. So that\u2019s up once Noem is confirmed. If all time is used, Bessent isn\u2019t confirmed until early next week.\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\nTRUMP NOMINEES COLLINS, STEFANIK TO FACE SENATE GRILLING AS VA, UN PICKS; BESSENT GETS COMMITTEE VOTE\n\n\"Do you all have your sleeping bags and cots?\" asked Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss.\n\nEveryone is settling in for a slog.\n\n\"Right now it appears there's every indication that votes will be taking place through Saturday. We'll see if that goes into Sunday or Monday without any days in between. But right now, I'm planning on being there for the weekend for votes,\" said Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M.\n\n\"I'm happy to be here all weekend, if that's what it takes,\" said Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.\n\nThat said, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., cautioned that things sometimes accelerate in the Senate. Especially when there\u2019s chatter of late-night votes and weekend sessions.\n\n\"I think I've seen this game before,\" said Durbin Tuesday. \"I think it ends with an accommodation and a bipartisan agreement. So I wouldn't jump too quickly now to reach a conclusion.\"\n\nDEM WHO CALLED TRUMP 'EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY' NOW BLOCKING HIS NOMINEES\n\nThat said, there are two factors afoot:\n\nDemocrats want to make a point about their reservations Trump nominees \u2013 especially those with whom they vehemently disagree or believe are unqualified. So politically, it\u2019s important that they go to the mat and show their base they\u2019re standing up to the President and his cabinet.\n\nBy the same token, this is Thune\u2019s first rodeo as Majority Leader. He needs to establish his bona fides as Leader. Politically, Thune must demonstrate he\u2019s fighting for Mr. Trump and his nominees \u2013 and willing to keep the Senate in session around the clock. In other words, there\u2019s a new sheriff in town.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo, unless something changes, everyone is dialed in for some lengthy weekend and even late-night sessions. It\u2019s likely the Senate will confirm President Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nBut it might just take a while.",

All voting Republicans supported the bill, along with 48 Democrats \u2013 two more than the most recent vote.\n\nTRUMP ELIMINATING LNG PAUSE TO HAVE \u2018QUICKEST EFFECT\u2019 ON ENERGY INDUSTRY: RICK PERRY\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate also advanced the bill in a bipartisan 64 to 35 vote, but added measures to deport illegal immigrants who assault a police officer or cause death or \"serious bodily injury\" of another person.\n\nThe original bill would direct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to detain illegal immigrants accused of theft-related crimes. It also would allow states to sue the Department of Homeland Security for harm caused to their citizens because of illegal immigration.\n\nThe majority of Democrats were against the bill, arguing that allowing people accused but not convicted of crimes to be deported is a slippery slope. But supporters of the bill point out that people here illegally have already run afoul of U.S. law.\n\nIt\u2019s notable, however, that more Democrats supported the bill when it passed the House this month than when it first came up for a vote in 2024. It\u2019s a marked difference from last year when the then-Democrat-controlled Senate did not even take up the bill for a vote.\n\n\"Nothing ever happens in this town up here until the American people demand it,\" the bill\u2019s leader, Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital when asked about the increased support from the left.\n\n\"And they have been screaming at the top of their lungs for something to happen to fix the border problem.\"\n\nRep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, who led Sarah's Law, one of the amendments adopted in the bill, told Fox News Digital, \"Nearly a decade ago, 21-year-old Sarah Root's life was tragically cut short when she was killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving while drunk\u2026Sarah's Law not only delivered justice for the Root family but also ensures that any illegal immigrant who harms or kills an American citizen is swiftly detained and prosecuted.\"\n\nKAMALA HARRIS MAKES TRUMP'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL WIN OFFICIAL DURING JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS\n\nGOP lawmakers are working to follow through on Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on illegal immigration and border security amid a flurry of executive orders from the president on those same issues. They\u2019re positioning the Laken Riley Act as the first bill to get Trump\u2019s signature as a reflection of their effort to make his agenda permanent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bill is named after a nursing student who was killed by an illegal immigrant while jogging on the University of Georgia's campus.\n\nJose Ibarra, who was sentenced to life in prison for Laken Riley's murder, had previously been arrested but was never detained by ICE.",

Walker fired a \"warning shot\" through the door and struck Officer Jonathan Mattingly in the leg.\n\nPROPOSED CHICAGO POLICE RESOURCE CUTS COULD LAND CITY IN COURT UNDER CONSENT DECREE, OFFICIALS WARN\n\nA consent decree, Brosnan noted, is different from other legal agreements in that it cannot simply be reversed by presidential order or a change of heart by one of the parties involved.\n\nThe consent decree alleged a pattern or practice of racial bias in Louisville policing, including in traffic stops, sexual assault probes or use of force.\n\nThere are at least two other police reform consent decrees going through the legal process, one in Maryland and one in Minnesota.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the DOJ reached an agreement with Minneapolis, which still requires court approval, to reform the department\u2019s \"unconstitutional and unlawful practices\" allegedly counter to the Americans With Disabilities Act and 14th Amendment.\n\nIn October 2024, the feds sued the Maryland Department of State Police alleging Civil Rights Act violations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The United States claims MDSP violated Title VII when it used a certain physical fitness test and a certain written test to hire entry-level Troopers because the tests disqualified more female and African-American applicants than others and were not job related,\" a court document states.\n\nMaryland police dispute the allegations.\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Charles Creitz contributed to this report.",

In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump wrote that it was an \"honor\" to appoint Curran.\n\n\"Sean is a Great Patriot, who has protected my family over the past few years, and that is why I trust him to lead the Brave Men and Women of the United States Secret Service,\" the president wrote.\n\nTrump called Curran a \"brilliant leader, who is capable of directing and leading operational security plans for some of the most complex Special Security Events in the History of our Country, and the World.\n\nWHO IS SEAN CURRAN?

Puzder, the president's pick for U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nPuzder is the former CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. In a post, Trump called the nominee \"a successful attorney, businessman, economic commentator, and author.\"\n\n\"During his 17-year tenure as CEO, Andy led the company out of serious financial difficulty, allowing it to survive, become financially secure, and grow,\" Trump said. \"Andy will do an excellent job representing our Nation\u2019s interests in this important region.\"\n\nSECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR CHEATLE RESIGNS AFTER MOUNTING PRESSURE IN WAKE OF TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\nIn a separate statement Wednesday, Trump announced that conservative writer L. Brent Bozell III has been named to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Trump said that \"few understand the Global Media landscape in print, television, and online\" better than Bozell.\n\n\"He and his family have fought for the American principles of Liberty, Freedom, Equality, and Justice for generations, and he will ensure that message is heard by Freedom-loving people around the World,\" Trump wrote. \"Brent will bring some much needed change to the U.S. Agency for Global Media.\"\n\nBozell has worked in conservative media for decades. The nephew of National Review founder William F. Buckley, Jr., Bozell founded the Media Research Center in 1987. In the fall, Bozell penned a supportive Fox News Digital op-ed about Trump's chances against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Trump has something Harris doesn\u2019t: a winning record, a winning agenda and a winning vision,\" Bozell wrote. \"She avoids her record because it\u2019s not only radioactive politically, but socialism has a rich history of utter failure everywhere.\n\n\"All Donald Trump needs to do is tell his story, remind people what was accomplished during his presidency.

After the 2020 election, Acosta's status at CNN was elevated to anchor, first on the weekends but eventually moving his way to weekday programming.\n\nWhile CNN's past leadership reveled in Acosta's constant sparring matches with the first Trump administration, the network's current leadership appears to be trying to tone down the dramatics.\n\nCNN'S JIM ACOSTA SAYS \u2018WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE\u2019 IN SHOT AT TRUMP AS HE RETURNS TO OFFICE\n\nIt was first reported in the Status newsletter last week that Acosta was pitched by CNN CEO Mark Thompson to move him from his one-hour slot at 10 a.m. ET to a two-hour slot beginning at midnight, a move that would \"effectively exile Acosta to the Siberia of television news,\" as it was characterized.\n\nThe report quickly sparked outrage among CNN's liberal fans, many saying such a move means the network is bending the knee to Trump.\n\nSources tell Fox News Digital that the chatter is legit, with one insisting Acosta is \"getting hosed\" as a result.\n\n\"Acosta is a talented broadcaster who could handle any slot on the network,\" a CNN staffer told Fox News Digital. \"The midnight thing is shocking [but] it is what it is.\"\n\nWhile the chatter has been described as \"gossip\" in CNN's hallways, the staffer is \"confident\" that the prospects of moving Acosta to the midnight timeslot is real and suggested it is Acosta's only path forward at the network.\n\n\"He could have a real slot, but the choice is to not give him one,\" the staffer added.\n\nCNN TO LAY OFF \u2018HUNDREDS\u2019 OF STAFFERS IN FIRST DAYS OF SECOND TRUMP PRESIDENCY: REPORTS\n\nThe Los Angeles Times similarly reported that If Acosta refuses to accept the midnight shift, \"he may exit the network, according to people familiar with his thinking.\"\n\nThe Times also reported that taking the midnight shift could move Acosta out of CNN's D.C. headquarters and into the network's Los Angeles bureau, though the move would not be a requirement as his family is rooted in Washington. The 12-2 a.m. ET time slot would overlap with primetime programming on the West Coast, airing from 9-11 p.m. PT.\n\nAnother CNN insider told Fox News Digital that executives were \"beyond apoplectic\" that news of Acosta\u2019s one-on-one conversation with Thompson was leaked, leaving the network flat-footed by the outrage generated online.\n\nA spokesperson for CNN declined to comment.\n\nPLAINTIFF IN CNN DEFAMATION TRIAL CELEBRATES \u2018VINDICATION\u2019 FOLLOWING COURTROOM DRAMA: \u2018I\u2019M GLAD IT'S OVER'\n\nAcosta first joined CNN in 2007, but his rise to stardom didn't occur until 10 years later when he was assigned by his then-boss Jeff Zucker to be the network's resident reporter in the White House briefing room. He quickly became notorious for shouting questions at Trump's White House press secretaries and frequently going toe-to-toe with the president himself, developing a reputation for grandstanding and receiving a profile boost by Trump after being called \"fake news.\"\n\nAcosta famously refused to give up the microphone in a 2018 press conference as he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump. The White House attempted to revoke Acosta's press pass following the dust-up, but his credentials were restored when CNN argued that it violated the First and Fifth Amendment rights of Acosta and the network.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAcosta's adversarial relationship with the first Trump administration appeared to be lucrative as he landed himself a book deal and became a frequent guest on liberal late-night shows, further fueling the star power that landed him an anchor chair during the Biden presidency.\n\nBut with a different boss at the helm, it remains to be seen whether Acosta's stature as CNN's #Resistance figure will carry on in the second Trump administration or if he will have to go elsewhere in order to resume his war of words with the president.",

Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Katie Britt of Alabama, would require the sale of land owned or \"influenced\" by the CCP that is deemed a national security risk. It would direct the president to take action to prohibit the purchase of public or private real estate in the U.S. by Chinese citizens or companies.\n\nChina owned around 350,000 acres of farmland across 27 states as of last year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAs of 2022, foreign entities and individuals held 43.4 million acres of U.S. agricultural land, which is nearly 2% of all land in the U.S.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN FAILING TO TRACK CHINESE OWNERSHIP OF US FARMLAND: GOVT WATCHDOG\n\nLawmakers have argued that China\u2019s land buys are a national security risk since many of them are near military installations. For years, Chinese nationals have attempted to breach U.S. military facilities, often through the use of surveillance drones or posing as tourists.\n\n\"For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has been gobbling up American farmland and real estate,\" Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\"At best, this submits American land and resources to China\u2019s best interests, not America\u2019s\u2014at worst, these purchases serve as outposts for Chinese espionage campaigns against American businesses and military bases. We can\u2019t allow Chinese citizens, or anyone affiliated with the CCP, to own one more inch of American soil. And any American land exploited by current Chinese ownership should be sold.\"\n\nSome states have already barred foreign nationals from purchasing land.\n\nSmithfield Foods, which has a Chinese parent company, makes up the largest share of Chinese-owned land with 110,000 acres.\n\nA 2022 Chinese land purchase brought concerns to a fever pitch when food producer Fufeng Group bought 370 acres for corn milling near a North Dakota Air Force base.\n\n\"One acre of American farmland owned by the Chinese Communist Party is one acre too many,\" said Britt. \"The CCP's strategic acquisition of farmland, particularly near our military installations, isn't just a national security risk, it is a threat to our economic and food security.\"\n\nTRUMP WANTS TO VISIT CHINA AGAIN AFTER HE TAKES OFFICE: REPORT\n\nThat prompted the Biden administration to propose a rule requiring any foreign company or individual looking to buy land within 100 miles of certain U.S. military bases to get government approval.\n\nLast month, a Chinese national was arrested at San Francisco International Airport before he could board a flight to China on accusations that he tried to fly a drone over Vandenberg Air Force base in California.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEfforts to thwart China from purchasing U.S. farmland near U.S. military installations have gained steam among Republicans in both chambers.\n\n\"It's a major concern for me that countries like China have increased purchases of American farmland tenfold over the last decade to control our land and threaten our food, energy and national security,\" Rep.

                "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAt noon on Monday, something extraordinary will happen. Donald Trump will once again take office as president of the United States. It is a political comeback unrivaled in our nation\u2019s history.\n\nThere will be balls and galas and fireworks galore. All of the traditional ephemera of power, all of the wealthy people strutting around in their tuxedos taking selfies. This is how the right set always congratulate themselves.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t win this election. The hard-working people of America did.\n\nTrump is not resuming residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because billionaires wanted it. Elon Musk and the Silicon Valley socialites didn\u2019t make this happen. Trump won because Americans with thankless jobs, like nurses, cops, plumbers, bus drivers and waitresses made it so.\n\nI know this because I spent the entire election traveling the country talking to them. I knew Trump would win because they wanted it. Demanded it.\n\nThese were everyday working people who told me that prices were too high, and the border is a national security threat. As one woman in Bedford, Pennsylvania, asked me, \"How do I know we won\u2019t be the next Springfield, Ohio,\" where migrants have overrun the community?\n\nIn Springfield, where I traveled to hear the real story, I was told that their community was being destroyed, that young people couldn\u2019t rent a house near their parents, because they were going three to a room to Haitian migrants.\n\nIn Staunton, Virginia, I met business owners, most of them self-described Democrats who were really struggling. Some of them were ready to give Trump a shot, not because they liked him, but because they kind of trusted him.\n\nIn San Francisco, I met Democrats near the end of their rope, so tired of mismanagement they were willing to try anything.\n\nIn Chicago, the union guys I talked to didn\u2019t love Trump, but were so terrified of Kamala Harris\u2019 incompetence and a Democratic Party that gave them more promises than results that they went for the Donald.\n\nYou can see the pattern. Trump\u2019s victory is not some great mystery, it was the natural conclusion of a Biden presidency that consistently put the American people and their interests last.\n\nScranton Joe\u2019s presidency was \u2013 and thankfully we can now say \"was\" \u2013 a disaster on almost every front. His hapless diplomatic corps stoked war across the globe, his economic team made basic groceries too expensive, and his Department of Justice went to war with Christianity.\n\nOn all of these fronts, Trump will be an improvement. That's why he was elected.\n\nBut as the Trump administration, with its flashy meme coins and elegant balls, takes power, a word of caution is in order. The people I met on the road across America aren\u2019t big fans of rich folks in fancy dress promising to control our lives.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThe truck drivers elected Donald Trump, the movers and construction workers elected him. They won\u2019t be at the galas, they won\u2019t get to hobnob with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who will sit at a dais at Trump\u2019s beck and call.\n\nAnd make no mistake, both those billionaires have bent the knee in a way no everyday worker in Brooklyn would, because the hardworking American never has to. They just show up at work, and then they, and only they, decide who wins elections.\n\nTrump has a generational opportunity to make this country better for working men and women. I don\u2019t think anybody doubts he wants that, or will fight for it, and that's cause for optimism.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the incoming Trump administration, once the festivities and hollow compliments from think tank millionaires have passed, better remember who really put them in power and why.\n\nThere\u2019s real hope, there really is, and there is a sense that this administration can put this country on a better foot. Polling shows 60% of Americans are optimistic about the incoming administration. That is great news.",

                "category": "lifestyle",
                "text": "Mark Zuckerberg, who often bends with the political winds, is getting out of the fact-checking business.\n\nAnd this is part of a broader effort by the Meta CEO to ingratiate himself with Donald Trump after a long and testy relationship.\n\nAfter a previous outcry, Zuck made a great show of declaring that Facebook would hire fact-checkers to combat misinformation on the globally popular site. That was a clear sign that Facebook was becoming more of a journalistic organization rather than a passive poster of users\u2019 opinions (and dog pictures).\n\nBut it didn\u2019t work. In fact, it led to more info-suppression and censorship. Why should anyone believe a bunch of unknown fact-checkers working for one of the increasingly unpopular tech titans?\n\nMESSY BACKSTAGE JOCKEYING IN TRUMP TRANSITION COULD SHAPE HILL STRATEGY 4 YEARS AFTER JAN 6\n\nNow Zuckerberg is pulling the plug, announcing his decision in a video to underscore its big-deal nature:\n\n\"The problem with complex systems is they make mistakes. Even if they accidentally censor just 1 percent of posts. That\u2019s millions of people. And we\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.\"\n\nLet me jump in here. Zuckerberg bluntly admits, with that line about \"cultural tipping point,\" that he\u2019s following the conventional wisdom\u2013and, of course, the biggest tipping point is Trump\u2019s election to a second term. And skeptics are portraying this as a bow to the president-elect and his team.\n\nTRUMP THREATENS MORE LAWSUITS AGAINST MEDIA AS ABC TO PAY $15 MILLION TO SETTLE CASE\n\n\"So we\u2019re gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms\u2026\n\n\"We\u2019re going to get rid of fact checkers\" and replace them with community notes, already used on X. \"After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy.\n\n\"We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth. But the fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created, especially in the U.S.\"\n\nIt was Zuckerberg, along with the previous management at Twitter, that banned Trump after the Capitol riot. This led to plenty of Trumpian attacks on Facebook, and the president-elect told me he had flipped his position on banning TikTok because it would help Facebook, which he viewed as the greater danger.\n\nTrump said last summer that Zuckerberg plotted against him in 2020 and would \"spend the rest of his life in prison\" if he did it again.\n\nThe president-elect boiled it down in a posting: \"ZUCKERBUCKS, DON\u2019T DO IT!\"\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more from Z: \"We\u2019re going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas. And it\u2019s gone too far.\"\n\nIndeed it has. And I agree with that. In 2020, social media, led by Twitter, suppressed the New York Post story on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, dismissing it as Russian disinformation, though a year and a half later the establishment press suddenly declared hey, the laptop report was accurate.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\u2019S TOUGH TALK\u2014BUY GREENLAND! TAKE BACK PANAMA CANAL!\u2014SPARKS DEFIANCE FROM MANY REPUBLICAN REBELS\n\nLet\u2019s face it: People like Zuckerberg and Elon Musk (now embroiled in a war of words with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over an alleged coverup of gang rapes of young girls when Starmer was chief prosecutor) have immense clout. They are the new gatekeepers. With so-called legacy media less relevant\u2013as we see with the mass exodus of top talent from Jeff Bezos\u2019 Washington Post and the recent rise of podcasts\u2013they control much of the public dialogue. And yes, they are private companies that can do what they want.\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s marathon news conference, a reporter asked Trump about Zuckerberg: \"Do you think he\u2019s directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past with promises?\"\n\n\"Probably. Yeah, probably,\" Trump said, twisting the knife a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, having made the obligatory trek to Mar-a-Lago for dinner, the CEO has taken a number of steps to join forces with the new administration. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that Meta is kicking in a million bucks to the Trump inaugural.\n\nZuck named prominent Republican lawyer Joel Kaplan as chief of global affairs, replacing a former British deputy prime minister. On \"Fox & Friends\" yesterday, Kaplan said:\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a real opportunity now. We\u2019ve got a new administration and a new president coming in who are big defenders of free expression, and that makes a difference. One of the things we\u2019ve experienced is that when you have a U.S. president, an administration that\u2019s pushing for censorship, it just makes it open season for other governments around the world that don\u2019t even have the protections of the First Amendment to really put pressure on US companies. We\u2019re going to work with President Trump to push back on that kind of thing around the world.\"\n\nWe\u2019re going to work with President Trump. Got it?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Zuckerberg is adding Dana White, chief executive officer of United Fighting Championship, to the Meta board. White is a longtime Trump ally, so MAGA now has a voice inside the company.\n\nIn other words, get with the program.\n\nFootnote: At his news conference, where Trump seemed angry about the latest court battles and plans to sentence him, the incoming president said\u2013or \"didn\u2019t rule out,\" in journalistic parlance\u2013 \"military coercion\" against two of his latest targets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Well, we need Greenland for national security purposes,\" he said. And Americans lost many lives building the Panama Canal. \"It might be that you\u2019ll have to do something.\"\n\nHe\u2019s not going to use military force against either one. But his answer stirs the pot, as he knew it would.",

                "text": "A Republican senator was expressing his unhappiness to Susie Wiles, the incoming White House chief of staff.\n\n\"I texted you three days ago,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nWiles, who ran President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, said she got it and would respond, without sounding like she was in a rush.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that her phone must be flooded with messages from people who want a job \u2013 or influence \u2013 in the incoming Trump administration.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\u2019S TOUGH TALK\u2014BUY GREENLAND! TAKE BACK PANAMA CANAL!\u2014SPARKS DEFIANCE FROM MANY REPUBLICAN REBELS\n\nBut the jockeying sheds light on a dilemma that Trump may face in a city that he controls, with both houses of Congress under Republican management (and Vice President Kamala Harris peacefully certifying the transfer of power yesterday, four years to the day after the Capitol riot).\n\nThe flip side of nearly unlimited clout is that when things go wrong, there\u2019s no one else to blame.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the black hole known as Congress. Having dragged Mike Johnson across the finish line in the election for speaker, by making calls even from his golf course, Trump now faces a dilemma after the Christmas debt ceiling battle that just delayed the budget fight until March.\n\nUsing a process known as reconciliation, which lowers the threshold from 60 Senate votes to 51 \u2013 both parties have used this for party-line dominance \u2013 Trump favors \"one big beautiful bill.\" That would include budget cuts, energy deregulation, tax cuts, the border crackdown and other presidential priorities.\n\nBut many on the Hill support two separate bills, and some in Trump World believe Congress simply doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth to take the kitchen-sink approach.\n\nSo the big beautiful bill might not get passed until June, depriving the 47th president of an early win.\n\nTRUMP MAKES A BLIZZARD OF NEWS, SHOWS RESTRAINT AT PRESSER, EVEN WHILE SLAMMING THE MEDIA\n\nJohnson will have just a 1-vote margin, making it hard for him to deliver the deep spending cuts that the hardliners want in an echo of the battle that toppled Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIn the meantime, the Homeland Security Department would have difficulty mounting a major initiative because, like other agencies, it\u2019s operating on the stopgap spending budget that nearly shut down the government at Christmas.\n\nThe risk of pushing two bills is that once the first one passes, the momentum may dissipate for approving a second measure, even if it contains such Trump priorities as tax cuts.\n\nTrump hedged his bets yesterday, telling radio host Hugh Hewitt, \"I would prefer one, but\u2026I\u2019m open to either way, as long as we get something passed as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWashington is a city obsessed with titles and perceived influence, and that will impact the way the White House is run.\n\nWiles has helped downgrade some jobs that have always been assistant to the president titles to deputy assistant to the president\u2013something no sane outsider would care about, but which is a major deal for the insiders. That\u2019s because after reaching the limit for assistant jobs, the only alternative was to create a bunch of deputy slots.\n\nWiles, for her part, has told Axios, \"I don't welcome people who want to work solo or be a star\u2026 My team and I will not tolerate backbiting, second-guessing inappropriately, or drama. These are counterproductive to the mission.\"\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the incoming press secretary, is also being deprived of the big office that has been used by her predecessors for at least three decades. That\u2019s going to another communications aide.\n\nI can remember being in that second-floor office when Mike McCurry was press secretary, and President Bill Clinton walking in and chatting while I was working on my book \"Spin Cycle.\" The reason for the large office was the gaggles taking place with the press, and sometimes interviews, which could not be accommodated by most smallish West Wing offices.\n\nAnyone in Wiles\u2019 sensitive position would invariably upset some officials during a process that determines winners and losers. But Trump views her as a grandmother and doesn\u2019t yell at her the way he might at other officials over a disagreement.\n\nAs for Elon Musk\u2019s powerful role, Trump enjoys the company of wealthy people, and the X owner is the richest person on the planet. So he has influence until he doesn\u2019t, if there is a future falling out.\n\nMUSK RENEWS HARSH REBUKE OF DEMS WHO REJECTED DEPORTING SEX OFFENDERS: VOTE OUT \u2018EVERY ONE\u2019\n\nBesides, it will be harder for Musk to hang around once Trump moves from Mar-a-Lago to the White House, unless he wants to give Elon the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\nFor now, the transition is organized chaos. But as Trump knows all too well, having done this job before, when there\u2019s a terror attack or border incident or rising grocery prices on his watch, he owns it.\n\nMeanwhile, with with Harris certifying her own defeat in routine fashion yesterday \u2013 drawing live coverage considering the history of Jan. 6 \u2013 President-elect Trump posted this:\n\n\"Biden is doing everything possible to make the TRANSITION as difficult as possible, from Lawfare such as has never been seen before, to costly and ridiculous Executive Orders on the Green New Scam and other money wasting Hoaxes. Fear not, these \u2018Orders\u2019 will all be terminated shortly, and we will become a Nation of Common Sense and Strength. MAGA!!!\"\n\nIs that worse than what happened on Jan. 6, 202?\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nIt\u2019s true that the outgoing president has, among other things, issued orders to stop oil exploration along 625 million acres offshore, but there\u2019s no reason the \"drill, baby, drill\" president can\u2019t reverse that, although it could slow him down.\n\nHarris gave a short talk yesterday about the peaceful transfer of power, and Biden made the case in a Washington Post op-ed that we must never forget what happened on that dark day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo matter who you agree with, I think it\u2019s fair to say that issue was litigated in the election, and Americans voted to put Trump back in the White House knowing full well what happened during the televised riot.",

                "text": "'There's a reason there are so many pizza restaurants': TV chef points finger on hospitality woes\n\nEach week we ask top chefs to take part in our Cheap Eats feature. Today we speak to award-winning TV chef Andi Oliver.\n\nIt's very hard to make money in hospitality... People think you are making out like a bandit if you have got a busy restaurant five or six days a week, but just turning the lights on costs a fortune, your business rates cost a fortune, your VAT cost a fortune, everything costs a lot of money. Good ingredients cost a lot of money. It's also expensive emotionally and psychically to deliver really great food. You can\u2019t take your eye off the ball for a second because the standard can drop really easily.\n\nWe have had 14, 15 years of quite destructive governmental rule... We are in a bit of a Catch-22 situation. It's got harder for a lot of people but I also think the national living wage has to go up. Getting this country sorted out is going to take some doing.\n\nIf you go to a restaurant and you have to wait an extra five minutes for your meal, just be patient... Have a drink and don't have a big fit about it. People are doing their absolute best.\n\nThere's a reason there are so many pizza restaurants around... You have to simplify your menu to reduce the financial difficulty. You have to pay people properly and you have to be responsible as an employer. But I think that the best thing to do is deliver something simple and deliver it well and you'll be able to keep your costs down.\n\nBad communication is my pet peeve anywhere... particularly in restaurants. It's okay not to know the answer to a question, but go and find out. Train your staff properly, give them the information they need to be empowered on the floor, behind the bar, in the kitchen, wherever it is because knowledge is power.\n\nMiserable people in restaurants... I can't bare it.\n\nFor cheap substitutes... I'm a fan of things like ox tail, brisket and pork cheeks. They deliver in flavour in the most amazing way. Slow-cooking them, layering spice complexity, using things like stouts or dark red wines. These kind of things will really give you depth of flavours.\n\nPut a bowl next to your cooker while you're cooking... Anything I'm cutting, ends of the onions, carrot peelings, stalks and herbs, goes into the stock pot bowl. I start the stock pot on a Sunday and then throughout the week I'm adding to that all the time, putting a bit more water in, and then maybe I'll roast some chicken wings and then I can use that stock to make a lovely chicken wing soup. Add a bit of rice to it or noodles and you've got a chicken noodle soup. If you've always got a stock pot, you have the basis for a sauce, a soup, a broth, and it means you are using up all your endy bits. It's really easy to do, just chucking in a few coriander seeds, juniper seeds, some fresh thyme, and you've got a really flavoursome broth going all week.\n\nPeople cook too quickly... Time develops flavour. If you are going to roast a chicken, don't try to do it in 40 minutes \u2013 take a good hour and 45 minutes. Make sure you do your shopping the night before. I say this all the time because I think it is a really big thing - people go shopping and then they come home and they have to cook and they get overwhelmed.\n\nTurn the heat down a bit... If you have it up so high, you lose control of what's happening on the stove. I like gentle cooking.\n\nIf you are boiling potatoes... put a little bit of fresh thyme, a clove of garlic and a bit of onion in the water with the salt and the potatoes. When you come to mash it, they will become infused with a lovely flavour.\n\nI use turmeric ghee all the time... Turmeric Super Ghee I absolutely love. It's clarified butter with turmeric in it. So at the end of a sauce, you take a spoonful of it and stir it in and then the whole thing becomes silken and golden and lovely.\n\nMy favourite cookery writer is a woman called Edna Lewis... She died a while ago, but she was an African American chef and she wrote a beautiful book called The Taste of Country Cooking. It is one of the most beautiful cook books I have ever read in my life.\n\nDon't try to be impressive, try to be delicious... Being delicious in turn will become impressive.\n\nOne restaurant that's worth splashing out on is... The Dorian in Notting Hill - incredible. Max Coen is the chef there and his food is unbelievable. We went there for my daughter's 40th. And obviously, it's a very, very special occasion. It's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but it's worth every single penny. He's a very soulful cook and he is so imaginative and he makes stunning food.\n\nMy favourite cheap meal out is... my friend's restaurant Shankeys in Hackney or the Raglan in Walthamstow. They are amazing and they have an incredible range which is an Indian Irish mix. Sasha in the kitchen is making the most delicious food. He is making things like curry cauliflower cheese paratha and they are crisp and silky and gooey and spicy all at the same time. The most incredible food. I'd order the cauliflower paratha, the most incredible fried chicken and the extraordinary oysters. Get yourself down there and get his chicken and a curried cauliflower paratha, and you'll thank me for it. At The Raglan, they do this thing called a spice bag where you get fries or you get chicken and you drop them in the bag with a whole bunch of spices and shake it up and it's absolutely delicious.",

Pic: Reuters\n\n'They ran a criminal enterprise'\n\nMr Sherborne said Harry's victory proves \"no one stands above the law\" and NGN had shown \"blatant disregard for the law\".\n\nHe said more than 100 private investigators had been \"engaged\" by NGN over at least 16 years on more than 35,000 occasions to intrude into the prince's private life.\n\nThis isn't the end of this story Rhiannon Mills Royal correspondent @SkyRhiannon Prince Harry all along wanted to make sure this wasn't simply about the stories written about him, but wanted them in court to admit there had been some kind of cover-up by senior executives who, he says, had known unlawful activities were being carried out by reporters and private investigators. It won't have been fully fulfilled because the News Group Newspapers apology did not admit to breaking the law on that front. That phrase, \"without any admission of illegality\", is the really important one. Because of that, Prince Harry's lawyer has said he wants the rule of law to take its course and that a dossier will be handed to the police now court proceedings have concluded. A victory for Prince Harry today - but you can see that all claimants involved do want this to go further.\n\nMr Sherborne said: \"At her trial in 2014, Rebekah Brooks said 'when I was editor of The Sun we ran a clean ship'.\n\n\"Now, 10 years later when she is CEO of the company, they now admit, when she was editor of The Sun, they ran a criminal enterprise.\n\n\"Far from being relics of a distant past, many of those behind these unlawful practices remain firmly entrenched in senior positions today, both within News UK and other media outlets across the world, wielding editorial power and perpetuating the toxic culture in which they continue to thrive.\n\n\"This represents a vindication for the hundreds of other claimants who were strong-armed into settling, without being able to get to the truth of what was done to them.\"\n\nThe lawyer said Harry and Lord Watson support calls for the police and MPs to investigate \"not only the unlawful activity now finally admitted, but the perjury and cover-ups along the way\".\n\nImage: Rebekah Brooks with Rupert Murdoch in 2010. Pic: PA\n\nWho is Rebekah Brooks? Rebekah Brooks was the editor of the News Of The World from 2000 to 2003, before holding the same role at The Sun from 2003 to 2009. When phone hacking accusations were made public, Ms Brooks herself was thrust into the spotlight. She stood trial alongside fellow ex-News Of The World editor Andy Coulson for conspiracy to hack phones in 2014 - but while Coulson was found guilty, Ms Brooks was cleared. She returned to News UK in 2015 and has been its chief executive since.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\n'There are strong controls at our titles today'\n\nNGN said its agreements with Harry and Lord Watson \"draws a line under the past\" and \"brings an end to this litigation\" and it was \"in the interests of all the parties to come to a settlement\".\n\nA spokesperson added: \"Today, our apology to the Duke of Sussex includes an apology for incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, not by journalists, during the period 1996-2011.\n\n\"There are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now.\n\n\"There was no voicemail interception on The Sun.\"\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\n'Danger to life' weather warning for parts of UK\n\nResidents 'shocked' as rubbish pile blocks village\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nExperts called this a \"huge victory\" for Prince Harry and said the apology was \"pretty sensational\".\n\nRoyal commentator Jennie Bond told Sky News: \"When you read that apology, albeit without an admission of illegality, it is extraordinary.\n\n\"It allows him to move forward with his life now, which I think is where he's going. He's trying to not always look backwards.\n\n\"I think what was so precious to him was to have an apology for his late mother because he has spoken about her so much and how she was persecuted.\"\n\nCampaign group, Hacked Off, which calls for the reform of UK press self-regulation, said the result was \"humiliating\" for The Sun.\n\nBoard director Emma Jones said: \"News Group has now spent over a billion pounds - funds which could have been put to much better use supporting journalism - fighting allegations which they have now largely admitted were accurate.\n\n\"The prime minister must get on with robust policy on press accountability without further delay.\"",

                "text": "According to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Southport attack was \"clearly intended to terrorise\".\n\nBut officially it wasn't, and still isn't, considered a terror attack because the police couldn't identify the killer's motive, so it falls outside the definition of terrorism.\n\nAxel Rudakubana even admitted a terror charge - possessing a training manual useful to a terrorist - but without a motive it's still not terrorism, apparently.\n\nNo wonder the public is confused - suspicious even that the government wanted to cover up the failure of its Prevent anti-extremism scheme, which Home Secretary Yvette Cooper now admits should have identified Rudakubana as a threat, especially as he was flagged three times.\n\nImage: Axel Rudakubana. Pic: Merseyside Police\n\nThe manual was found at his home a couple of days after the attack, but he wasn't charged with the terror offence for another three months.\n\nAgain, easy to see why some people cried \"cover-up\".\n\nWhen asked about his decision to withhold information about the Southport attacker by Sky News political editor Beth Rigby, Sir Keir said he knew details about Rudakubana, as they were emerging, but it \"would not have been right to disclose\" them.\n\nIt's easier to understand why other details of the police investigation were not revealed.\n\nThat's normal when there is expected to be a criminal trial in which a jury must decide its verdict purely on what it hears in court, untainted by anything it might have heard or read before.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:58 Southport: Did PM withhold info?\n\nRead more:\n\n'Nothing off the table in Southport inquiry'\n\nMissed opportunities to stop Southport killer\n\nHow people of Southport are trying to make sense of horror\n\nThe traditional media usually sticks to that rule because to flout it could land journalists in prison for breaching the Contempt of Court Act 1981.\n\nA lot of information has emerged since Rudakubana pleaded guilty to murder on Monday, scrapping the need for a trial, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has still stopped some known details being published ahead of Thursday's sentencing.\n\nOf course, many social media users aren't aware of, or simply don't care about, the contempt laws and post in ignorance or malevolence some vital facts - plus the rumours and gossip - the rest of us have to keep schtum about.\n\nJurors are always warned to forget anything they read or hear outside the courtroom.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It's stuck in my head.\n\n\"He came down here and if I'd have known what was going to transpire after that, he wouldn't have left his yard.\"\n\nColin said he has struggled with the possibility he could have done something: \"We all have. It's all ifs and buts and it goes without saying had we seen anything or had we known, he wouldn't have been doing what he did next door.\"\n\nAs the attack unfolded, Colin raced to the Hart Space and saw the victims running in terror. He called 999.\n\nHe still has nightmares and flashbacks.\n\nImage: Rudakubana pleaded guilty this week. Pic: Merseyside Police\n\n\"You just don't know what we walked into,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope we saved some lives that day with what we did and our quick reactions, but there's devastation that we lost three of them, and they were only young kids - little baby girls really - and no one should do that.\"\n\nThe fate of six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, is now woven into the fabric of Hart Street. The trauma of that day is still palpable.\n\nImage: (L-R) Victims Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva Aguiar\n\nOne woman - who helped shield children that day - spoke for many in questioning why so much focus is now on the attacker.\n\n\"Why is it all about him?\" she said. \"Three girls died.

I'd stay away from it. But I've got to come here. My business is here and I've got to carry on.\"\n\nThere is relief for many that they will not have to relive the horrors in court - Colin was due to give evidence on his birthday.\n\nLike many on Hart Street, he has heard the now national conversion about the attacker's past. He wants the lessons to be learned but his thoughts are with the families.\n\n\"It is all too late,\" he said.",

Both pleaded guilty to phone hacking and were jailed.\n\nImage: Tom Watson and Prince Harry's barrister David Sherborne speak to the media. Pic: PA\n\nAcross the following five years, numerous other allegations against the News Of The World came to light and its former editor Andy Coulson was jailed for conspiracy to hack phones in 2014.\n\nThe paper was shut down by NGN in 2011, after allegations its staff had hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.\n\nAs the News Of The World scandal unfolded, numerous public figures claimed they had been targeted by journalists at The Sun using similar, and they said illegal, tactics.\n\nWhat has NGN said about The Sun?\n\nIts apology for allegations against The Sun is more specific. Crucially, NGN has said sorry for unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the paper - but \"not by journalists\".\n\n\"There was no voicemail interception on The Sun,\" it adds.\n\nImage: News Of The World closed in 2011 - but The Sun remains popular in the UK. Pic: Alamy\n\nAddressing the wider media landscape, NGN's statement claims: \"In the 1990s and early 2000s there was widespread use by the broadcast and news media of private investigators.\n\n\"In most cases, their use was for public interest journalism and to obtain information necessary for the purposes of journalism.\"\n\nThe publisher has also given an insight into the argument its lawyers were preparing to put forward in court - directly contradicting one of Harry's major claims.\n\nIt says: \"It must also be stressed that allegations that were being made publicly pre-trial (and indeed post-settlement) that News International destroyed evidence in 2010-11 would have been the subject of significant challenge at trial.\n\n\"These allegations were and continue to be strongly denied [with] extensive evidence.\"\n\nWhat has Prince Harry said?\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:08 Harry scores 'monumental victory' in trial\n\nIn a statement issued on behalf of Harry and Lord Watson, their barrister David Sherborne hails the settlement as a \"monumental victory\" as \"News UK have admitted that The Sun, the flagship title for Rupert Murdoch's UK media empire, has indeed engaged in illegal practices\".\n\nHe highlights how NGN has spent more than \u00a31bn on settlements relating to accusations against both papers, adding: \"News UK is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law.\"\n\n\"The truth that has now been exposed is that NGN unlawfully engaged more than 100 private investigators over at least 16 years on more than 35,000 occasions,\" the statement continues.\n\nWhile NGN has unequivocally denied destroying evidence relating to investigations, Mr Sherborne's statement makes it clear Harry is not backing down on this accusation.\n\nIt alleges: \"Senior executives deliberately obstructed justice by deleting over 30 million emails, destroying back-up tapes, and making false denials - all in the face of an ongoing police investigation.\n\n\"They then repeatedly lied under oath to cover their tracks - both in court and at the Leveson public inquiry.\"\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nMr Sherborne's statement also directly contradicts NGN's claim that \"there are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now\".\n\nIt says: \"Far from being relics of a distant past, many of those behind these unlawful practices remain firmly entrenched in senior positions today, both within News UK and other media outlets across the world, wielding editorial power and perpetuating the toxic culture in which they continue to thrive.\"\n\nHow does Rebekah Brooks come into it?\n\nRebekah Brooks was the editor of the News Of The World from 2000 to 2003, before holding the same role at The Sun from 2003 to 2009.\n\nWhen phone hacking accusations were made public, Ms Brooks herself was thrust into the spotlight. She stood trial alongside fellow ex-News Of The World editor Andy Coulson for conspiracy to hack phones in 2014 - but while Coulson was found guilty, Ms Brooks was cleared.\n\nImage: Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks in 2010. Pic: PA\n\nShe returned to News UK in 2015 and has been its chief executive since.\n\nIn the statement on behalf of Harry and Lord Watson, Mr Sherborne says: \"At her trial, in 2014, Rebekah Brooks said 'when I was editor of The Sun we ran a clean ship'.\n\n\"Now, 10 years later when she is CEO of the company, they now admit, when she was editor of The Sun, they ran a criminal enterprise.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBoth sides have given clear explanations of what they're hoping for in their respective statements.\n\nMr Sherborne's reads: \"The rule of law must now run its full course. Prince Harry and Tom Watson join others in calling for the police and parliament to investigate not only the unlawful activity now finally admitted, but the perjury and cover-ups along the way.\n\n\"It's clear now that this has occurred throughout this process, including through sworn evidence in inquiries and court hearings, and in testimony to parliament, until today's final collapse of NGN's defence.\n\n\"Today the lies are laid bare. Today the cover-ups are exposed. And today proves that no one stands above the law. The time for accountability has arrived.\"\n\nMore from Sky News:\n\nBoy, 14, arrested over 12-year-old's death\n\n90mph winds spark UK weather warning\n\nImage: Harry and Lord Watson are calling for further action.

Any cases now brought, years after the events, will be liable to be struck out.\n\n\"The Sun today can face the future and continue its proud record of award-winning public interest journalism, investigations and campaigning on behalf of its readers.\"\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"We are aware of the outcome of the civil proceedings. It remains the case that there are no active police investigations into allegations of phone hacking or related matters.\n\n\"We await any correspondence from the parties involved, which we will respond to in due course.\"",

                "text": "There's a deep, transatlantic contrast between the bombastic billionaire Donald Trump and the bespectacled human rights lawyer Sir Keir Starmer, on a political and a personal level.\n\nDespite the so-called \"special relationship\" it's clearly going to be an uphill battle for the British PM to forge a productive relationship with the incoming president, but he has no choice but to do so.\n\nPolitics latest: Trump 'within his right' to make statement on tariffs\n\nThe Sunday papers are full of briefings about the difficulties ahead. The Mail on Sunday claims Sir Keir Starmer would be at the \"back of the queue\" for a visit to the White House (in contrast to Theresa May's highly awkward appearance after just seven days), claiming \"he will have to eat humble pie\" before receiving an invitation.\n\nAccording to The Independent, sources in the Trump campaign suggest that the President-elect is considering rejecting Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, an almost unprecedented move that would be a huge diplomatic insult.\n\nLabour figures have been doing their best to downplay these reports, with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones telling Sky News \"I doubt very much that's going to happen\", adding that the claims are \"probably being propagated by some politicians that would like to cause a bit of a nuisance.\"\n\nWorld leaders such as Italy's Georgia Meloni and Argentina's Javier Milei, more closely aligned with Trump's populist politics, have been invited to the inauguration.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:54 Thousands march ahead of Trump's inauguration\n\nStarmer has not been, though No 10 say the UK is to be represented by outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce, in line with usual diplomatic protocol.\n\nBut with a crowd of high-profile right-leaning British politicians partying in Washington - including Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Suella Braverman, Priti Patel and, of course, Nigel Farage all in attendance - he is at risk of looking a little left out.\n\nSo what are the key stumbling blocks between the two leaders?\n\nLabour support for the Democrats\n\nOne issue is the Trump team's anger at Labour activists travelling to America to campaign for Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nHistorically, it's been relatively normal for Labour volunteers to help out the Democrats, and Tories to do so for Republicans. But this time it hit a nerve, prompting a complaint to the US Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe impression of entrenched opposition to the Trump project from the Labour hierarchy was highlighted again this morning by an article for The Observer by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, warning of \"the spectre of resurgent fascism\" ahead of the inauguration.\n\nImage: Sadiq Khan has warned about fascism 'resurging' ahead of Trump's inauguration\n\nWhile Mr Jones swiftly distanced himself and the government from this kind of language, it's a reminder of the catalogue of insults showered on Trump by senior Labour figures during their time in opposition, from David Lammy's \"woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\" to Wes Streeting's \"odious sad little man\".\n\nThe reality of life in government has tempered the cabinet's public language - but the wider party's opinion of Trump is likely to be unchanged.\n\nNigel Farage\n\nWith Reform surging in popularity and challenging both the Conservatives and Labour in the polls, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has been having a field day in Washington DC.\n\nIn interviews with UK media from a pre-inauguration party on a hotel rooftop, he has been boasting of members of the incoming Trump cabinet on speed dial, and even speculating that he could become prime minister himself before Donald Trump's term in office comes to an end.\n\nFarage is offering to help smooth the UK government's relationship with Trump and his team - but accepting his offer will surely be too awkward.\n\nImage: Mr Farage speaks at a Trump campaign event in Arizona in 2020. Pic: Reuters\n\nElon Musk\n\nThe furore over the UK's response to grooming gangs may have died down somewhat following the Home Office's announcement about five local inquiries and a nationwide review into the issue, but the world's richest man misses no opportunity to kick the UK government on X, his social media platform.\n\nElon Musk may have fallen out of love with Mr Farage over his lack of support for Tommy Robinson but he still appears obsessed with promoting Reform and making inflammatory attacks on Sir Keir Starmer and other members of his team.\n\nAs a member of Trump's cabinet, Musk's claims about free speech and child sexual exploitation in the UK could be a real problem for the Labour leader in terms of his reputation with the president-elect.\n\nThe Chagos Deal\n\nThere's frustration in the Trump team too about last-ditch UK efforts to get the contentious Chagos deal over the line before the inauguration.\n\nThe agreement would see the UK hand over the remote archipelago to Mauritius - in line with rulings from the international courts - but pay to continue leasing the US/UK military base on Diego Garcia for the next 99 years.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThe Americans, and many Conservatives, are concerned about the deal's national security implications. This week Downing Street said it was only \"reasonable\" for Mr Trump to want to look at the deal once he takes office, but the delay has created an awkward outstanding diplomatic and political issue.\n\nDefence Spending\n\nDefence spending - and the question of an end to the war in Ukraine - is another likely source of tension.\n\nMr Trump has made no secret of his frustration with the fact that the US spends much more on defence than most NATO countries, calling for a new target of 5% of GDP.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:17 Trump: 'NATO is taking advantage of us'\n\nAt 2.3%, the UK more than meets the current NATO target of 2% and the PM has pledged to set out a pathway to 2.5% this year - but given current spending constraints, and concern about future cuts, that feels like a long way off.\n\nTrump has also signalled his hesitation about the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, saying he \"understands their [Russia's] feelings\" about having \"somebody right on their doorstep\".\n\nMr Trump's determination to bring the war with Russia to a speedy end has already shifted the dial in terms of the international focus away from the supply of weaponry to the question of a possible peacekeeping operation - with Sir Keir Starmer talking about the UK playing a \"full part\" in that in future.\n\nRead More:\n\nWhy the consequences of Trump 2.0 are likely to be profound\n\nRe-engagement with China\n\nPresident-elect Trump has been outspoken in his view that China is now the US's biggest rival, threatening to slap tariffs on imports from the country once he takes office.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:39 Reeves defends China visit amid criticism\n\nIt's a message distinctly at odds with the Labour government's policy of \"re-engagement\" with China in the pursuit of economic growth.\n\nJust last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves travelled to Beijing in what she described as a spirit of \"pragmatic cooperation\", touting British businesses and boasting of \u00a3600m in new investment to the UK as a result.\n\nBut in what seems like a hasty about-turn, Lord Mandelson - previously a vocal proponent of greater trade links with Beijing - wrote an article for Fox News this week which flattered Trump and criticised China for being \"more aggressive abroad and controlling at home\" and challenging \"Western governments and their values\".\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Tap here to follow\n\nMinisters are hoping the special relationship could shield Britain from the worst direct impacts although our global exposure means we would take a hit from tariffs disrupting international trade elsewhere too.\n\nWith a manifesto promise to \"reset\" the UK's relationship with Europe, Starmer could opt to offset the risks of a hit to our transatlantic trade with a greater focus on the flow of goods across the Channel.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have been calling for a new customs union with the EU this week, as a show of strength against the US. But that kind of talk could risk antagonising Trump's team further.\n\nMr Jones did his best to allay these economic fears, telling Trevor Phillips \"we do have a plan\" for tariffs but \"I don't think we're going to be in that scenario\".\n\nImage: Darren Jones said he doesn't not think Trump will impose tariffs on the UK\n\nMr Jones's optimistic tone on Sunday is an attempt to demonstrate that whatever the unpredictability of a Trump administration, it's fundamentally business as usual for the UK government and the special relationship. Keep calm and carry on, he almost said.\n\nWhen challenged about their position with Mr Trump, Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Lammy repeatedly fall back in talking about the dinner they enjoyed with him in New York in September as a demonstration of their \"good relationship\".\n\nBut the bonhomie of one evening and a few diplomatic phone calls will look increasingly thin as other world leaders line up to shake hands with the President in the Oval Office, and behind the scenes, UK officials will be working to get the PM to Washington as quickly as possible.",

Cameras that recorded the horror on their doorsteps were taken away to provide the evidence.\n\nThe attack that took the lives of Alice Aguiar, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Bebe King and injured others, has left an indelible mark on an unremarkable street in a genteel seaside resort.\n\nImage: (L-R) Victims Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice Dasilva Aguiar\n\nAxel Rudakubana, 18, from Lancashire, pleaded guilty to their murders at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday.

I know a lot of people are definitely still in shock as well because it was in front of them that it happened.\"\n\nShe was on the phone to her mum when she heard the first screams. Her front window, she said, felt like a giant TV screen, only the images playing out were of real-life horror.\n\nImage: Florist Briony said she 'heard screams' on the day of the attack\n\n\"I remember the parents turning up. They were abandoning the cars and running down the road screaming,\" she said. \"I'll never forget that sound, just absolutely horrendous.\"\n\nHart Street is one of many in Southport that features the idiosyncrasy of small industrial units tucked behind the rows of neat Edwardian houses and accessed by driveways between.\n\nIt was in one of the units that the attack took place, its victims spilling into the street as it unfolded.\n\nSteve, who was rebuilding a wall in his front garden, ushered many of them, some badly injured, into his house and the care of his wife. He grabbed a hammer and went to confront the attacker as police arrived.\n\nA survivor of the Hillsborough disaster, he plays down his role on 29 July.

I just think of the families,\" he said.\n\nImage: Hart Street in Southport, where the attack took place last July\n\nThe heroism of the people of Hart Street gave way to a community response that sustained each other through those first few days and in the months since.\n\nInitially, inside the bubble of the police cordon, they were insulated from the global spotlight that turned on their street.\n\nToday there are people who, politely, refuse to talk about what happened. They have relived it enough. You can read in their eyes the trauma they carry.\n\nBut there are others who, if they would rather not talk publicly, do want to talk about it. Maybe it is easier to a stranger. Perhaps it is some catharsis for an experience, they all agree, that has changed everyone.\n\nThe pain on Hart Street is palpable.\n\nPeople recall explaining to their own children why the faces of girls they knew were suddenly on the television, how seeing a certain shade of green brings back memories of the attacker's distinctive hoodie, how anxiety now accompanies even the most routine of daily chores.\n\nSome wonder whether they could have done something to stop the attack.\n\nImage: Thousands of flowers were left on Hart Street in the aftermath of the attack\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\n'I'm back to my beloved life', says freed British-Israeli hostage\n\nHeavy winds set to batter parts of UK\n\nWhen you walk up garden paths that police swept for DNA evidence, when you use pavements and alleyways that were the scene of the most unimaginable horror - when does anything ever return to normal?\n\nOne house became an impromptu post office for the cards of condolence that arrived from around the world.

I thought it was disgusting,\" said Briony. \"It was just a sign of pure hatred and nothing else.\"\n\nShifting the focus away from the families of the victims, for many, is unforgivable.

                "text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she will overrule environmental objections to a third runway at Heathrow in order to prioritise economic growth, a position likely to bring her into conflict with colleagues including energy secretary Ed Miliband.\n\nSpeaking as she began a 48-hour pitch to international investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ms Reeves said she would back infrastructure projects even where they are unpopular.\n\nThe expansion of Heathrow has been debated for almost 20 years but despite the consistent support of business groups and a consensus it would boost economic activity, environmental and political objections have prevented it.\n\nMoney blog: New tax rises now 'a good bet' for 2025\n\nAsked directly if she would now put the runway, along with expansion at Gatwick and Luton ahead of the UK's net zero commitments, Ms Reeves said: \"I'm not going to comment on speculation, but what I would say is when the last government faced difficult decisions about whether to support infrastructure investment, the answer always seemed to be no.\n\n\"We can't carry on like that, because if we do, we will miss out on crucial investment here into Britain. You've already seen a number of decisions, including on Stansted and City Airport, on energy projects, on transport infrastructure, because we are determined to grow the economy.\"\n\nThe chancellor's trip to Davos comes with her economic program under increased scrutiny after a bumpy start to the new year, including a rise in borrowing costs and data showing the economy has stagnated since the election.\n\nBusiness groups have also questioned the increase in employment costs in the budget, but Ms Reeves insisted the UK is competitive internationally, and has a strong case to make to international markets.\n\n\"If you look at the UK's taxation compared with countries around the world, we remain highly competitive, we have the lowest corporation tax in the G7. Amongst European countries, we have some of the lowest employment taxes, So Britain is an attractive place to invest.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nPolitics may stand in the way of economics when it comes to airport expansion\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nMs Reeves also hailed the removal of the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority, a regulator regularly blamed for unnecessarily slowing down deals, as a sign she was serious about growth.\n\n\"We've got huge strengths as a country and this government is reforming the planning system, reforming the regulation system, making it easier for businesses to get things done, all with the purpose of making working people better off,\" she said.\n\nUK not a target\n\nThe chancellor said she did not think the UK would be a target for tariffs threatened by president Donald Trump, largely because Britain has a trade deficit with America, and that she planned to meet the incoming Treasury secretary once he is confirmed.\n\nGrowth trade offs thrown into stark relief Paul Kelso Business and economics correspondent @pkelso The saga of a third runway at Britain's biggest airport encapsulates, perhaps better than any, the trade-offs required to prioritise growth. Airport expansion is a proven vehicle for growth. Heathrow's current investors are desperate to expand, despite the cost of complications. But for a decade political opposition, from Boris Johnson to Sadiq Khan, has stood in the way. Of course, there are sound environmental arguments against that a government committed to net zero by 2050 might consider, and Ed Miliband can be expected to make. But if growth really is the priority then at some point they have to choose. Given the multiple avenues for objection and the strength of feeling inside and outside cabinet, Ms Reeves' position does not mean that a runway is now more likely than it was six months ago. It may however be less unlikely, and as a short-term signal to the investors she is courting in Switzerland, that is a start.\n\n\"I believe in free and open trade, and I'll be making that case to my counterparts in the United States. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with the new Trump administration.\n\n\"Trade between the UK and the US is worth \u00a3300bn a year, a million Brits work for American firms, a million Americans work for British firms, so our economies are closely intertwined, and I look forward to enhancing and strengthening that relationship.\"\n\nPrivately some international investors and British company bosses in Davos have questioned the clarity of Ms Reeves's message, but she has received public support from significant companies.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nBill Winters, the chief executive of bank Standard Chartered, told Sky News: \"I think the chancellor is doing the right thing in terms of putting the sign out that the UK is open for business.\n\n\"She's also made very clear statements about the fact that we're going to reduce some of the red tape set back to regulation in a way that's safe and sound. Exactly how that's going to work through, we'll see. So I'm encouraged, but obviously, she's got a huge, huge challenge.\"",

But I won't believe it until I see and feel it for myself.\"\n\nMandy spoke publicly about her daughter for the first time last October - almost a year after she was taken hostage.\n\n\"One year has passed and she is still in hell,\" she told a rally in Hyde Park.\n\nAt that point, Mandy, 63, said she had spoken to some of the hostages released by Hamas as part of an earlier ceasefire deal, who had told her that her daughter was still alive.\n\n\"They all told me about her bravery and courage and even her laughter and the way she helped hold everyone together even in the worst times,\" she said.\n\nShe said they also told her that Emily had had lice and was living in filth, forced to use a bucket as a toilet.\n\nMandy's appeal was backed by Orly Goldschmidt, a spokeswoman for Israel's UK embassy, who told Sky News at the time that Emily was \"still in the dungeon of Hamas\".\n\nRead more:\n\nGaza faces immense task of rebuilding after mass destruction\n\nCeasefire brings hope for thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nIn an update provided by the family in December 2024, they opened up on their fears over Ms Damari's health, saying they hadn't had any proof that she was still alive since March 2024.\n\n\"We worry that Emily is no longer singing,\" her mother said.\n\n\"Over the last 14 months whilst in captivity enduring unimaginable horrors, she has missed birthdays, weddings and the births of friends' and family members' children.\"\n\nThe family revealed Ms Damari's grandfather Sidney Moss, who lived in London, died last year aged 97, knowing his granddaughter was still held captive in Gaza.\n\nFinal few hours 'the most agonising'\n\nA close family friend of the Damari's, Emily Cohen, opened up on what they were going through shortly before Emily's release.\n\n\"These final few hours have been the most agonising that you can imagine after nearly 500 days of unending torment for Mandy and all the other families,\" Ms Cohen said.\n\n\"Obviously this is amazing news for Mandy and the family, but she will only believe it when she actually gets to see Emily alive and give her that hug she's been dreaming of. Now she is so close to that moment it makes the pain even more intense.\n\n\"As a mother, seeing how Mandy has campaigned tirelessly for Emily has been utterly inspiring. I cannot begin to explain how brave and fearless she has been fighting for her daughter, pressuring world leaders and international organisations relentlessly and constantly.\n\n\"Given how unbearable the last few hours have been and the rollercoaster of emotions please respect Mandy's privacy at this very critical time.\n\n\"I know she wants everyone to know how deeply grateful she is to the British public, MPs, football supporters and strangers from around the world who have been praying and campaigning for Emily's release.\"\n\nHow did the hostage release happen?\n\nEmily Damari's release is part of a ceasefire deal agreed by Israel's cabinet on Friday night after a breakthrough in negotiations mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt was announced on Wednesday.",

I want Heathrow to be that European hub for travel\".\n\nPut in purely economic terms, airport expansion is a no-brainer.\n\nMoney blog: Trump's cryptocurrency crashes as critics call it worthless\n\nThe economic case\n\nThe independent commission led by Sir Howard Davies, the former chairman of NatWest, and published as long ago as July 2015, concluded that \"expanded airport capacity is crucial for the UK's long-term prosperity\".\n\nGatwick, according to a report prepared for the airport by the independent economic consultancy Oxera, generated \u00a35.5bn for the economy in 2023 and supported more than 76,000 jobs.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Expansion on the airport's estimates creates up to 6,100 jobs and contributes an extra \u00a3900m to GDP.\n\nTrumping them both, of course, is Heathrow.\n\nThe Davies Commission said that building a third runway to the northwest of the airport would provide for around 40 new destinations from Heathrow and would create more than 70,000 new jobs by 2050, adding some \u00a3147bn to GDP.\n\nIt stated: \"Heathrow is best-placed to provide the type of capacity which is most urgently required: long-haul destinations to new markets. It provides the greatest benefits for business passengers, freight operators and the broader economy.\"\n\nImage: Pic: PA\n\nIt is worth noting that among the members of the commission was Sir John Armitt, the respected former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, who is now chair of the National Infrastructure Commission.\n\nHis term of office was extended by Ms Reeves in October last year in order for him to oversee the 10-year strategy ordered by the chancellor and the establishment of the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority.\n\nHe will be an influential voice in this debate.\n\nHowever, while the economic case for airport expansion is unimpeachable, the bigger question, perhaps, is whether it is achievable.\n\nPolitical considerations\n\nGetting approval for the expansion of both Luton and Gatwick will be a major test of the new government's commitment to overhauling planning regulations where they are an impediment to growth.\n\nAnd here there are - for supporters of expansion - ominous signs.\n\nA decision on whether or not to expand Luton was postponed for the third time just before Christmas so that Heidi Alexander, who had just succeeded the disgraced Louise Haigh as transport secretary, could be given time to assess the application.\n\nClimate concerns\n\nTied into the planning hurdles are the inevitable environmental objections.\n\nThe Climate Change Committee, the government's independent advisory body, has already said emissions savings would have to be made elsewhere in the economy were there to be a big expansion in airport passenger numbers.\n\nThe aviation industry will doubtless argue that it has already committed to becoming net zero by the middle of the century - but the environmental lobby has a long track record of successfully campaigning against airport expansion.\n\nOn top of that are the political obstacles.\n\nMs Reeves - and Ms Alexander, should she back expansion of Gatwick and Luton - will face implacable opposition from within their own cabinet, not least from Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary.\n\nBacking Heathrow expansion would be more controversial still.\n\nSadiq Khan, the London mayor, is strongly opposed to this and so are other senior Labour figures, among them Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester.\n\nHe argues that a third runway at Heathrow would run counter to levelling-up proposals - although it is worth noting here that some of the UK's biggest regional airports, such as Newcastle, support a third runway on the basis that it would boost international connectivity to their region.\n\nThat means leadership will ultimately have to come from Sir Keir Starmer who, it is worth noting, voted against a third runway at Heathrow in 2018.\n\nGovernment unlikely to ever get credit\n\nSupporting airport expansion is often difficult for governments - quite apart from the environmental objections and the inevitable planning hurdles - because it takes so long to add capacity and ministers are therefore unlikely to receive credit for it during their political lifetime.\n\nFor example, the two main airport expansion projects currently under way in Europe, the new Luis de Camoes airport in Lisbon and the new Solidarity superhub in Warsaw, are unlikely to be completed until the mid-2030s.\n\nBut the latter, in particular, highlights how other European governments have no hesitation in seeing airport expansion as a major generator of growth.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nIt is not alone. Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, an increasingly important competitor to Heathrow, is currently investing some \u20ac6bn in upgrades with the aim of expanding both passenger and flight numbers. Budapest, an airport once owned by BAA, the former parent of Heathrow and Gatwick, is looking to build a third terminal that would generate an extra three million passengers by the end of the decade.\n\nThese examples highlight how other European governments are less squeamish about putting airport expansion over environmental considerations in the name of pursuing economic growth.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nYou can be sure that the international investors who own Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton will be looking to the UK to do likewise.",

Today we speak to award-winning TV chef Andi Oliver.\n\nIt's very hard to make money in hospitality... People think you are making out like a bandit if you have got a busy restaurant five or six days a week, but just turning the lights on costs a fortune, your business rates cost a fortune, your VAT cost a fortune, everything costs a lot of money. Good ingredients cost a lot of money. It's also expensive emotionally and psychically to deliver really great food. You can\u2019t take your eye off the ball for a second because the standard can drop really easily.\n\nWe have had 14, 15 years of quite destructive governmental rule... We are in a bit of a Catch-22 situation. It's got harder for a lot of people but I also think the national living wage has to go up. Getting this country sorted out is going to take some doing.\n\nIf you go to a restaurant and you have to wait an extra five minutes for your meal, just be patient... Have a drink and don't have a big fit about it. People are doing their absolute best.\n\nThere's a reason there are so many pizza restaurants around... You have to simplify your menu to reduce the financial difficulty. You have to pay people properly and you have to be responsible as an employer. But I think that the best thing to do is deliver something simple and deliver it well and you'll be able to keep your costs down.\n\nBad communication is my pet peeve anywhere... particularly in restaurants. It's okay not to know the answer to a question, but go and find out. Train your staff properly, give them the information they need to be empowered on the floor, behind the bar, in the kitchen, wherever it is because knowledge is power.\n\nMiserable people in restaurants... I can't bare it.\n\nFor cheap substitutes... I'm a fan of things like ox tail, brisket and pork cheeks. They deliver in flavour in the most amazing way. Slow-cooking them, layering spice complexity, using things like stouts or dark red wines. These kind of things will really give you depth of flavours.\n\nPut a bowl next to your cooker while you're cooking... Anything I'm cutting, ends of the onions, carrot peelings, stalks and herbs, goes into the stock pot bowl. I start the stock pot on a Sunday and then throughout the week I'm adding to that all the time, putting a bit more water in, and then maybe I'll roast some chicken wings and then I can use that stock to make a lovely chicken wing soup. Add a bit of rice to it or noodles and you've got a chicken noodle soup. If you've always got a stock pot, you have the basis for a sauce, a soup, a broth, and it means you are using up all your endy bits. It's really easy to do, just chucking in a few coriander seeds, juniper seeds, some fresh thyme, and you've got a really flavoursome broth going all week.\n\nPeople cook too quickly... Time develops flavour. If you are going to roast a chicken, don't try to do it in 40 minutes \u2013 take a good hour and 45 minutes. Make sure you do your shopping the night before. I say this all the time because I think it is a really big thing - people go shopping and then they come home and they have to cook and they get overwhelmed.\n\nTurn the heat down a bit... If you have it up so high, you lose control of what's happening on the stove. I like gentle cooking.\n\nIf you are boiling potatoes... put a little bit of fresh thyme, a clove of garlic and a bit of onion in the water with the salt and the potatoes. When you come to mash it, they will become infused with a lovely flavour.\n\nI use turmeric ghee all the time... Turmeric Super Ghee I absolutely love. It's clarified butter with turmeric in it. So at the end of a sauce, you take a spoonful of it and stir it in and then the whole thing becomes silken and golden and lovely.\n\nMy favourite cookery writer is a woman called Edna Lewis... She died a while ago, but she was an African American chef and she wrote a beautiful book called The Taste of Country Cooking. It is one of the most beautiful cook books I have ever read in my life.\n\nDon't try to be impressive, try to be delicious... Being delicious in turn will become impressive.\n\nOne restaurant that's worth splashing out on is... The Dorian in Notting Hill - incredible. Max Coen is the chef there and his food is unbelievable. We went there for my daughter's 40th. And obviously, it's a very, very special occasion. It's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but it's worth every single penny. He's a very soulful cook and he is so imaginative and he makes stunning food.\n\nMy favourite cheap meal out is... my friend's restaurant Shankeys in Hackney or the Raglan in Walthamstow. They are amazing and they have an incredible range which is an Indian Irish mix. Sasha in the kitchen is making the most delicious food. He is making things like curry cauliflower cheese paratha and they are crisp and silky and gooey and spicy all at the same time. The most incredible food. I'd order the cauliflower paratha, the most incredible fried chicken and the extraordinary oysters. Get yourself down there and get his chicken and a curried cauliflower paratha, and you'll thank me for it. At The Raglan, they do this thing called a spice bag where you get fries or you get chicken and you drop them in the bag with a whole bunch of spices and shake it up and it's absolutely delicious.",

                "text": "Donald Trump has said that attacks on police officers during the January 6 riots were \"minor incidents\".\n\nIn his first sit-down interview since being inaugurated on Monday, recorded in the Oval Office, Mr Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity most of those who were jailed over the US Capitol riots were \"absolutely innocent\".\n\nAs part of a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in office, the president pardoned around 1,500 people who were convicted over the unrest - including more than 200 who were jailed for felony assault on police officers.\n\nSpeaking to Hannity on Fox, Mr Trump said of those convicted: \"Nobody's ever been treated so badly. They were treated like the worst criminals in history.\"\n\nHe went on to claim those at the US Capitol were simply there \"protesting the vote\" before again falsely claiming the 2020 election was \"rigged\".\n\nWhen asked by Mr Hannity about the pardons for those jailed for assault, the president said: \"They were very minor incidents, and it was time.\"\n\nThe president was equally dismissive of the alleged threat to US security posed by TikTok.\n\nHe ordered the reactivation of the video-sharing site shortly after it had been closed down in the US by a law passed under the Biden administration, because of concerns over links between the owners and the Chinese government and the perceived threat to personal data.\n\nHe said \"we have so many things made in China\" and questioned why it would be important for China to be spying on \"young kids watching crazy videos\".\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nElsewhere, Mr Trump said the US government should not give California aid to help rebuild after wildfires in Los Angeles until it uses water from the northern part of the state.\n\nThe president has accused Governor Gavin Newsom of refusing to redirect water from northern California as it protects the Delta smelt - an endangered species of fish. Mr Newsom has denied the claim\n\n\"I don't think we should give California anything until they let water flow down,\" he said.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update. Tap here to follow\n\nMr Hannity also asked the president about surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer, where Mr Trump was shot in the ear by a gunman after turning his head at the moment the shot rang out.\n\nMr Trump said it was \"split second perfect timing\" to look at the immigration board he had behind him that day, and added: \"I don't think you can just call it luck.\"\n\nWhen asked if surviving the attempt had changed him, the president said: \"I haven't changed. But it's increased my faith in God.\"\n\nYou had better get used to the song, because he has no plan to change the record, by David Blevins What you see is what you get. President Trump doesn't have one face on camera and another off it. His first broadcast interview since his return to the White House on Monday was entirely predictable. The questions asked by Sean Hannity of Fox News seemed irrelevant to him. He had already decided what he wanted to talk about and hit every square in the Trump political bingo card. There was the same old criticism of Joe Biden, of the Democrats' response to the wildfires in California, and of their policies on immigration. And there was defence of his decision to pardon January 6 rioters, whose offences he down-played as \"very, very minor\". When the interviewer tried to interrupt him to talk about the economy, he replied: \"I don't care.\" That \"don't care\" approach turns every interview or press conference, either planned of impromptu, into a monologue. It's Donald's way or the highway, but that's the route that's been chosen by the American people. You had better get used to the song, because he has no plan to change the record in the next four years.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nFormer 'MAGA cult' member rejects riot pardon from Trump\n\nTrump's unpredictability already has profound consequences\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHe told Mr Hannity that Mike Pompeo - his first secretary of state - raised national security concerns over the release of documents, but said he is still looking at declassifying them.\n\n\"I'm going to release them immediately upon getting - we're going to see the information - we're looking at it right now,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump inevitably spent some time railing against the previous administration, but again said Joe Biden had left a nice letter for him in the drawer of the desk in the Oval Office, the contents of which he has now allowed to be published.\n\nBiden's letter to Trump in full\n\nDear President Trump,\n\nAs I take leave of this sacred office I wish you and your family all the best in the next four years.\n\nThe American people - and people around the world - look to this house for steadiness in the inevitable storms of history, and my prayer is that in the coming years will be a time of prosperity, peace, and grace for our nation.\n\nMay God bless you and guide you as He has blessed and guided our beloved country since our founding.\n\n- Joe Biden",

This is the future.\n\nHe promised he would get down to business and so he did. It's been hard to know which way to look; what to focus on.\n\nLatest on Trump's new presidency\n\nPresident Biden preferred short days. President Trump chooses unpredictable days. He thrives on them; he thrives on surprise.\n\nSo here are a few observations from this whirlwind week, three days in.\n\nAccessible\n\nFirst, accessibility.\n\nFor all his seeming hatred and vilification of the media, President Trump has given the press far more access and opportunities to question him than his predecessor ever did.\n\nThat doesn't mean the answers he gives to the many questions thrown at him are always particularly meaningful, satisfactory or honest but we've already had two free-flowing news conferences.\n\nThere's been no aide selecting reporters to ask their questions.\n\nIt's just been Trump fielding the rowdy reporters' quickfire queries.\n\nLast night, inside the White House, he responded to plenty of issues.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:52 Inside Trump's White House\n\nOn the Ukraine question - he's talking to Zelenskyy he said and will meet with Putin \"anytime he wants\". Still, he offered no further detail on how he'd end the war.\n\nOn tariffs - he hinted how China and Mexico could avoid 25% levies on their goods.\n\nHe said the tariffs are \"because they are allowing fentanyl into our country\".\n\nStop the fentanyl and the tariffs go?\n\nOn the release of the January 6 convicts including the leader of the far-right Proud Boys - he suggested they could have a place in the political conversation.\n\nOn Elon Musk buying TikTok - \"If he wanted to buy it, yeah.\"\n\nHe looked like he was enjoying the back and forth. He was providing an open forum to probe him and, maybe, expose him.\n\nSpreaker Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

And murderers don't even go to jail in this country,\" he said.\n\nThis is a wildly misleading sidestep designed to distract from his decision to pardon 1,500 people.\n\nDifferent shades\n\nThird observation - we are already seeing the different shades of Trump.\n\nDeeply controversial announcements have come, with dizzying speed, but mixed with policy decisions many will see as pragmatic and sensible.\n\nThe investment in AI, combined no doubt with minimal regulation, could help scientists in healthcare research make America much more competitive and boost the American energy sector.\n\nPositives and negatives there.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump tries to negotiate TikTok sale on TV\n\nMigrants suffer reality of Trump's first days in office\n\nMusk responds to accusations over hand gesture\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nHis intentionally unpredictable foreign policy is already yielding results, like the Gaza ceasefire, but his red lines are obscure to adversaries making miscalculations a risk.\n\nAnd his domestic agenda is proving already to be deeply controversial and perhaps even constitution-defying, setting a dangerous precedent.\n\nAmerican dominance\n\nFinal observation. Trump's unpredictability, volatility and transactional instincts are having immediate profound consequences.\n\nFar from being an increasingly irrelevant, declining nation, America feels - in just a few (long) days - to have become more powerful and more dominant than it has been for a very long time.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nThe necessity to dance to America's tune has never been greater.\n\nDonald Trump would have it no other way.\n\nWe must watch now for when someone chooses to test him.",

                "text": "There's a chart that's been doing the rounds in recent weeks - American businessman Marc Andreessen tweeted it, and then it was reposted by Donald Trump himself.\n\nThe chart is pretty simple: it shows the proportion of American federal government revenues coming from tariffs, going all the way back to the early days of American independence.\n\nAnd to glance at, it tells a compelling story. For nearly all of the 19th century, tariffs imposed on goods imported into America provided more than half the government's revenues.\n\nThe president's interpretation was as follows: \"The tariffs, and tariffs alone, created this vast wealth for our country. Then we switched over to income tax. We were never so wealthy as during this period. Tariffs will pay off our debt and, MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN!\"\n\nMoney blog: New tax rises now 'a good bet' for 2025\n\nThe first half of his post is quite true. America's federal economy was largely built on revenues from tariffs. When Alexander Hamilton was designing much of the federal infrastructure, not to mention paying the debts from the War of Independence, he chose to fund it with tariffs and duties on goods imported to the country.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:34 What are \u2018Trumponomics\u2019?\n\nRevenue wasn't the only reason for the tariffs. They were there, too, to protect the country's nascent industries. But those tariffs were the main source of income for a long time. What changed? Well, from the late 19th century onwards, the size of the American state expanded. Paying for the Civil War was expensive; funding a growing welfare state and national infrastructure in the following decades likewise.\n\nBut tariffs can only go so far. There is only so high one can lift these fees before they begin to stifle activity, making goods so expensive to import that domestic consumers face economic damage. That brings us back to the data in the chart approvingly cited by the president.\n\nTake the same numbers and divide them by GDP - the total size of the US economy - another way of skinning it (indeed, the way you'd normally look at long-run historical figures like this). Now everything looks somewhat different. You can see that at no point in American history - even in those early days when tariffs were far higher than today and a far more important source of revenues - did the total amount they raised exceed 6% of gross domestic product. This is not accidental.\n\nIt was because tariffs couldn't raise enough to finance the Federal administration that successive administrations began to collect other taxes on American citizens rather than imports, starting with excise taxes and income taxes in the Civil War. Those taxes, collected by the Internal Revenue Service, ballooned in the following decades - as did the size of the state.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nToday the American federal budget is orders of magnitude bigger than two centuries ago (albeit still much smaller than those you find in Europe). The new administration has made it an explicit policy to cut back on waste, led in part by Elon Musk and his DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency, whose name was seemingly chosen in order to fulfil Mr Musk's ambition to turn everything into a meme). But there are limits to how far one can cut: a superpower with a large military, vast infrastructure networks such as road and rail, not to mention public health and education systems, does not come for free.\n\nEven so, raising revenue is just one purpose of tariffs. They can also be used as a negotiating tool with other countries (indeed, this might well be their main function in the hands of Mr Trump). They can be used to protect domestic industries against competition.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nWhatever the purpose, after decades of relatively free trade around much of the world - most notably America itself - we are living now in an era where tariffs are back.

And that's a situation to avoid at all costs.\"\n\nThe OBR will publish an economic and fiscal forecast on 26 March, five months after its last forecast, which said the October budget was unlikely to increase economic growth over the next five years.\n\nMr Haldane, who became well-known for his speeches during COVID, said his concern depends on how much government spending is cut by the chancellor this spring.\n\n\"For me, I think some of the gloom and doom about both the economy and in bond markets is slightly overdone,\" he added.\n\n\"I think once we get to the second half of the year, the underlying fiscal picture may look somewhat better as might be the underlying growth picture.\n\n\"So anything precipitating now, I think, is best avoided.\"\n\nImage: The OBR gave a dismal outlook when Rachel Reeves announced her autumn budget.

Pic: Reuters\n\nMr Haldane added he thought \"there were mistakes in execution\" of the autumn budget in October, \"but even larger mistakes in the communication around that budget\".\n\nHe said: \"Personally, I would not have loaded so much onto business at the budget but more importantly still, I would have found a way of communicating that budget in terms that could help businesses see that if not now, then tomorrow, this was a pro-business budget and that wasn't done and that led to the further breakdown in business confidence.\"\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Mr Haldane also said he thinks Donald Trump \"taking an axe to regulation\" and thinking \"very differently\" about how government functions means there is \"a chance of real growth and supply side upside from which we will all learn better\".\n\nYou can watch the full interview at 7pm on Wednesday on Politics Hub with Sophy Ridge on Sky News.",

This week, a reader asked what they could do after being charged nearly \u00a3200 by TUI for overweight luggage.\n\nHannah asked: \"We booked a holiday with TUI and the night before we tried to increase our luggage allowance (we were travelling with our one-year-old and only managed to finish packing at 6pm). TUI wouldn't let us upgrade the baggage on the app (it should have cost us \u00a38 to do so) and we spent hours on hold to customer services who weren't able to increase our baggage allowance. When we turned up at the airport the next day, they charged us \u00a3196 for overweight luggage. They won't refund us as they say it's our fault. What can we do?\"\n\nOur cost of living specialist, Megan Harwood-Baynes, said it was an \"unusual\" case, before reaching out to TUI herself, and managing to get Hannah a well-deserved refund and apology.\n\nHere is what Megan had to say about the case...\n\nHaving recently flown myself (albeit with another airline), I was under the impression you should be able to add additional luggage right up until you check in. However, you told me there was no option to do this either before, during or after the check in process.\n\nImage: Luggage on weight at check-in counter at airport\n\nYou were, fortunately, able to upgrade your luggage on your return journey, which means you were saved another \u00a3196 fee for the 14 extra kilograms you had packed (which was largely stuff for your young son).\n\nYou said you had exhausted the complaints process with TUI, as they said it was an error on your end for turning up with bags that were too heavy.\n\nI asked TUI if they had experienced an issue with their app that meant this option was unavailable.\n\nWe had a bit of back and forth as I pointed out to them that you received an email two days before the flight that suggested you could add luggage right up until check-in, but this had not been possible.\n\nAfter about a week, the team at TUI concluded they had made an error with the fee they charged you because you should have been able to add on additional luggage right up until check in.\n\nThey have said they will send you a refund for \u00a3196. You told me you were delighted with this outcome.\n\nIn a statement, the team told me they wanted to apologise after you were \"unfortunately overcharged\" and said it arose due to \"a human error\".\n\n\"We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused,\" TUI said, adding that they hope to see you \"on a TUI holiday again soon\".\n\nRead more from this series:\n\nWhat the TUI website says about excess luggage\n\nTUI warns that if your luggage is heavier than your allowance, you will get charged if you don't sort it before the airport.\n\nExcess luggage charges are:\n\nShort and mid-haul flights (less than seven hours): \u00a355 per 15kg bag and \u00a314 per kilogram\n\nLong-haul flights (over seven hours): \u00a375 per 15kg bag and \u00a318 per kilogram\n\nFor bookings that do include a checked-in luggage allowance, if you exceed this you'll be charged per kilogram as above\n\nHowever, if you add the baggage before you check in, you will be offered a cheaper price. TUI confirmed to me the only deadline to do this is before online check-in.\n\nWhat you could have done next\n\nIf you complain to an airline but do not feel your complaint has been adequately resolved, the next step would be to take your issue to the Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) body.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nThere are a few different ones depending on the airline, you can view them here.\n\nIf the airline or airport does not have an agreement with an ADR, you can refer your complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nAlways keep as much proof as possible (screenshots, receipts, emails) to help make your case.\n\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.

                "text": "Every week in our Money blog, we answer questions about your financial problems or consumer disputes. This week, a ready asked what they should do if they're being chased by a private car park over an old fine.\n\nEllie asked: \"I've been receiving harassment from a private car park company regarding a parking fine from five years ago. The incident occurred while I was shopping and I had to assist someone who had collapsed. The shop verified this at the time and I'd let the company know when I was chased at the time. I thought the matter was closed. What are my rights in defending myself?\"\n\nWe spoke to Scott Dixon, from The Complaints Resolver, about this one - and he explains it's worth first outlining the rules about private parking \"fines\" in broad terms before answering the specifics of Ellie's case along the way.\n\nPrivate companies cannot 'fine' you\n\nCouncils can fine you for infringements on public highways (like parking on double yellow lines or in a bus lane) and issue penalty charge notices - these must be paid, or you can appeal it with as much evidence as possible. You risk bailiffs, clamping, your vehicle being towed away and a court order (which could impact your credit score if you lose) if you do not pay, though never pay a council or private parking ticket if you intend to appeal, as payment is considered an admission of liability;\n\n- these must be paid, or you can appeal it with as much evidence as possible. You risk bailiffs, clamping, your vehicle being towed away and a court order (which could impact your credit score if you lose) if you do not pay, though never pay a council or private parking ticket if you intend to appeal, as payment is considered an admission of liability; Private parking operators, which this post will focus on, cannot clamp you and they can't fine you as such - they issue parking charge notices, which are invoices for an alleged breach of contract for parking on private land.\n\nRead our award-winning Money blog here\n\nScott says: \"They look the same, and there's a reason for that. A private parking operator's business model is to extract money from you, and it's estimated that 80% of motorists pay straightaway due to the legalese jargon.\"\n\nOf course, landowners should reasonably be able to charge people to park on their land, so if you're at fault it might be that the right thing to do is pay up.\n\nBut if you think what they're charging you in their \"invoice\" is unfair, Scott says you could appeal.\n\nSome advice online suggests you can simply ignore these \"invoices\" - Scott doesn't recommend this but we'll cover this in more depth shortly.\n\nCollect evidence for appeals\n\nThis will be key to any appeals or court action - so take photos, get witness statements, keep all correspondence and get proof of any mitigating circumstances.\n\nOn Ellie's case, Scott says: \"Do you have the contact details for the person you assisted or any witnesses? You could go back to the shop and ask them if they can assist and provide you with confirmation in writing, although this may be difficult given the time that has elapsed.\"\n\nScott also suggests you submit a data subject access request to the private parking operator and DVLA to access all of your personal data that's being used in this case.\n\nRead more from this series:\n\nAppealing private tickets\n\nA ticket might be considered unfair if you didn't actually break any rules, the signage was poor or unclear, you didn't park on private land or there being some mitigating circumstances such as in your case, Ellie.\n\nUnfortunately, in this instance it's too late for you to lodge an appeal - but we'll outline the processes for readers anyway.\n\nThere are two parking trade associations in the UK and have a code of practice for their members to abide by.\n\nFirst, the British Parking Association. You can check its website to see if an operator is a member. The BPA set up the Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA) service - but you need to go through the operator's own process first.\n\nScott says: \"Roughly one in four parking charges are cancelled due to the operator not responding to POPLA and over 40% of appeals made to POPLA are upheld, which evidences my suspicions that private parking operators play the percentages game knowing that many motorists simply pay up even if they believe that they have done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe International Parking Community is the other trade association and operates the Independent Appeals Service.\n\nScott adds: \"First stage appeals are often rejected regardless of any mitigating circumstances, so you could have escalated your appeal to the second stage and it should have been upheld.\"\n\nYou gave 28 days to do this.\n\nIf you lose the appeal, you can either pay or defend it if it goes to court.\n\nIf the company is not part of a trade organisation\n\nCheck to see if a private parking operator is part of a trade body.\n\nIf not, they can only access keeper details from the DVLA if you respond to appeal one of their \"invoices\".\n\nIf you have responded without realising and divulged keeper details, keep in mind that firms who aren't part of trade organisations may have dubious appeal policies.\n\nInstead of appealing, consider writing to them explaining why you think the parking charge notice is unfair, with evidence to reinforce your case.\n\nDoing nothing\n\nThere is plenty of anecdotal evidence online that private firms don't always consider it worthwhile going to court for small amounts - but there is no guarantee you'll get lucky,\n\nScott says: \"I recommend you don't ignore these 'invoices', as these private parking operators pursue alleged debts through the courts and you risk incurring a county court judgement which can impact your ability to get loans, mortgages, mobile phone contracts and any credit for many years.\n\n\"Trivial amounts quickly escalate into hundreds of pounds when court fees, solicitor fees and debt recovery fees are added.\"\n\nIt's important to stress there are some types of letters you could consider ignoring - and some you should definitely not.\n\n\"You can safely ignore any debt collector letters,\" says Scott, because unlike councils, private parking firms or the debt collection companies they employ cannot use bailiffs.\n\n\"These debt collectors are 'strangers to the debt' and don't own the debt or have any powers to enforce it. This means that they are third parties to the alleged debt and have as much power as I do to enforce a private parking ticket.\n\n\"The letters use legalese jargon to intimidate and coerce you into paying up with threats of escalating costs and county court judgements. It's a tried and tested business model and usually works.\"\n\nHowever, Scott says, it is essential you respond to any \"letter before claim\" or \"letter before action\".\n\n\"This is the final stage before a case goes to court and needs to be completed prior to a court hearing.\"\n\nCourt\n\nStatute limitations for bringing a case to court are six years in England and Wales and five years in Scotland from the date of the parking event - so we are still in this timeframe with Ellie's case.\n\nIt would be a civil action - there is no guilty or not guilty, and you can't get a criminal record.\n\nYou will be issued with a county court judgment if the court rules against you. You will have to pay the parking charge notice fine plus some costs, and failing to do so could impact your credit rating.\n\nA private parking operator cannot send bailiffs to your home. Bailiffs are only sent to your home to pursue court orders for non-payment of penalty charge notices issued by councils.\n\nScott says: \"The defence in your case Ellie is that the contract you entered into by parking on private land was frustrated by impossibility due to an unforeseen event through no fault of your own.\"\n\nOne potential \"ace card\" that Scott says often succeeds in these kinds of court case is this...\n\n\"Ask their solicitor on the day if they have a 'right of audience'? Basically, do they have the right of audience to represent their client?\n\n\"Many solicitors are self-employed and do not have the right to represent these private parking operators. They just turn up on the day they are asked to. If they do not have a right of audience in court, the case should automatically be dismissed.\"\n\nWould Ellie win in court?\n\nScott says: \"Evidence is key. If it went to court, it would depend on the evidence presented, hence why you need to submit a data subject access request to the private parking operator and DVLA. You may find key pieces of information you can present in court to prove your case.\"\n\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.\n\nIn cases like the above, you should always seek independent advice from a professional who can look at your case in detail.

I've spoken to a colleague who said it happened to them last year, they kept it and nothing happened.

                "text": "Every Monday in our Money blog we get an expert to answer your Money Problems. Today's question is from Ellie, who asks...\n\n\"My outstanding student loan balance is around \u00a35k and I'm repaying it with a 4.3% interest rate. I can't decide whether it would be better to pay it all off in one go, or leave the money in a savings account. Can you help? I have also overpaid so am technically due for a refund of \u00a3300 - but should I withdraw that money?\"\n\nI first established with you that paying off your remaining student loan would not wipe out your savings, because ensuring you have an emergency fund is really important, whatever stage you are at. The recommendation is to have the equivalent of three months' worth of essential outgoings to fall back on.\n\nI then consulted Save The Student (STS), to see if we could figure out what your options are.\n\nThey needed a few more details and we worked out that because you are on Plan 1 and graduated in 2013 (and thus started repaying your loan in April 2014) your loan would get written off after 25 years, in 2039.\n\nIf you're ever unsure what your repayment terms are, you can find them here...\n\nTom Allingham, student money expert at STS, says: \"It's an age-old question, and there isn't one set answer that applies to everyone. But for me, the big thing to consider is how likely you are to repay your loan in full before it's cancelled.\n\n\"As someone with a Plan 1 Student Loan, you're already more likely to clear your balance than others as the repayment threshold has always been the lowest, and the debt won't have accrued as much interest as on other plans.\"\n\nHe pointed out that you have a relatively small amount of debt remaining and over half your repayment term left to go. Without knowing your salary, he can't say for certain if you will repay your debt in full, but the general consensus is that if you are earning in the high \u00a320,000s you will repay your loan before 2039. This means clearing it early could end up saving you interest you would otherwise be paying.\n\nBut if you are earning less than \u00a330,000 it may be worth reconsidering - and even claiming the refund you are due.\n\nImage: Tom from Save The Student says if you earn over \u00a330k, you could consider clearing the balance. Pic: Save The Student\n\nWeighing up the interest\n\nLet's weigh up the interest rates and see if you could end up saving any money.\n\nI checked our latest savings guide, and the best easy access accounts offer a rate of 4.85%.\n\nI used the Bank of England's calculator to have a look at how much interest you would earn in a year - it tells me that with 4.85% as a rate of return, you would earn just over \u00a3240 a year in \"free money\". Over four years, you would earn just shy of \u00a31,000.\n\nI then used a couple of different student loan calculators to see what they said - I had to make a couple of assumptions about your salary (I put your salary at \u00a332,000, though it varies, so I would recommend trying it yourself with your actual details).\n\nOne told me you would end up paying about \u00a31,247 extra in interest by the time you paid off the loan (which it said would take seven years), while another told me it could be as little as \u00a3300 in interest.\n\nI would try these for yourself and then weigh up the interest you would earn, versus the interest you will pay.\n\nOther financial considerations\n\nAs well as assessing how likely you are to repay, you need to consider if wiping your Student Loan is a financial priority.\n\nTom says: \"It is important to consider other factors, like what else your savings could be used for. Student Loans have no impact on your credit score and will eventually be wiped, so if you have other more expensive debts that need repaying, they should be your priority.\n\n\"Similarly, if you're looking to buy a house or make another big purchase very soon, your savings could be better put towards that.\"\n\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.

We tried several times to call the car hire desk. They will not refund me.\"\n\nWe asked Scott Dixon, from The Complaints Resolver, for his advice on this one.\n\nScott points out that you will have booked a holiday/flights with easyJet and then a car hire via its website - so your contract for the latter is unlikely to be with them.\n\nYou therefore need to check the terms and conditions to see what the car hire company says about flight delays. Scott notes that these are key terms and can't be buried in the small print.\n\nThe next step would be to lodge a formal complaint with the provider with proof - e.g. screenshots of call times and dates - showing you tried to inform them of the delay but couldn't speak to anyone.\n\n\"It is unfair and unreasonable to expect you to be left out of pocket through no fault of your own,\" Scott says.\n\nIf the hire firm is a member of the British Vehicle Rental Leasing Association or European Car Rental Conciliation then you will have additional rights and another avenue to seek redress.\n\nIf you paid for the car hire by credit card and it cost more than \u00a3100, you could also raise a Section 75 claim with your credit card provider to request a refund, as the card provider is jointly liable. (You can read what Section 75 is here).\n\nScott suggests stressing that there has been a \"breach of contract\" with evidence to support your claim.\n\nYou should also see what your travel insurance says.\n\nCompensation via easyJet\n\nYou might be eligible for compensation for the flight cancellation via easyJet - but not if it was caused by something outside of their control.\n\n\"Airlines like to cite 'extraordinary circumstances' on cancellations, so question that further if necessary,\" says Scott.\n\nThe amount of compensation - if any - that you may receive depends on the flight distance and how much notice you were given. If the flight was cancelled less than 14 days before you were due to fly and it's easyJet's fault, you could be due a payment.\n\nCould compensation also cover the hire car cost?\n\nDirect consequential losses, such as car hire and hotel losses, don't fall under passenger compensation regulations, Scott says.\n\nHe adds that the exception would be if everything was booked as a package holiday.\n\n\"I would press easyJet on this and ask if they can offer either a voucher/refund for the missed car hire under the circumstances,\" Scott adds.\n\nScott advises putting everything in writing to create a paper trail and evidence to support your dispute.\n\nRead more Money Problems:\n\n'Someone was killed in my house - do I need to tell buyers?'\n\n'A dry cleaner ruined my sofa'\n\n'My new barber butchered my hair and now I look like my teenage son'\n\nIf all else fails, you could take your case to the small claims court if it was England or Wales, or follow simple procedure in Scotland or the claims process in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Perseverance breaks resistance. Don't be fobbed off and don't give up, as airlines and other traders rely on tried and tested tactics to frustrate legitimate claims and deny you a right to redress,\" he says.\n\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.

                "text": "Every week in our Money blog, we answer questions about your financial problems or consumer disputes. This week, a reader asked what rights they had after her sofa was ruined by a dry cleaners.\n\nReader Maureen asked: \"I have had half my sofa covers cleaned by Johnsons, the cleaners. They have been ruined as the Belgian linen was hand washed and the care instructions not followed.\n\n\"This happened in July. I have been in communication with customer services who finally agreed that half a sofa could not be reupholstered - and, verbally, said they'd cover the whole suite.\n\n\"Last week I received an email from management now reneging on the offer and instead offering a small amount of money that will deem my sofa unfit to use as it won't cover either a reupholster or new sofa. Where do I stand?\"\n\nImage: Reader Maureen sent us a photo of the ruined sofa\n\nOur cost of living specialist Megan Harwood-Baynes replied...\n\nYou sent me further details of your complaint, including photographs and your correspondence with Johnsons (the bits that have been in writing).\n\nI can see in your email correspondence with Johnsons that they will not pay what you say is required to reupholster the whole sofa. They say their liability to you extends only to the actual covers that were submitted for cleaning.\n\nThe original sofa cost you \u00a32,400 eight years ago, and you also have a quote for completely reupholstering it, which comes to \u00a32,560. You (rightly) argue that it's not really possible to reupholster half a sofa.\n\nRegarding the verbal offer you say was made, Helen Dewdney, a consumer expert at The Complaining Cow, says she always tells people to put everything in writing because there is no evidence when you make phone calls - so bear this in mind going forward.\n\nAs for your rights now, your issue falls under the Consumer Rights Act 2005, she says.\n\n\"If services are not undertaken with reasonable skill and care and your items get damaged or lost then you have the right to claim compensation,\" Helen says.\n\nThis can include claiming for the cost of replacing a damaged or lost item, although there may be a reduction for wear and tear of the original item.\n\nJohnsons has already offered some compensation to you (\u00a3800). They claim that the age of the sofa means it \"holds no residual value\" but offered 25% of the original price, an additional \u00a3200 as a gesture of goodwill, and a refund of the original cleaning charge.\n\nHowever, you are not happy with this because you say it is not enough to either fix or replace your \"ruined sofa\".\n\nI reached out to Johnsons, and they did not reply, but you told me that two days after I emailed them, they almost doubled the amount of compensation on offer (to \u00a31,500).\n\nYou went back to them with a counter-offer of \u00a31,700, they agreed, and you are now finally able to bring the saga to a close (and get your sofa fixed).\n\nHad they not agreed, you could have considered these next steps...\n\nMembership of the Textile Services Association is available to laundries, dry cleaners, textile renters and their suppliers, Helen says.\n\n\"If the company you are using is a member, then the TSA offers a conciliation service. You may be asked to prove your claim and, on a loser-pays basis, use the association's testing service. It also offers an arbitration service if the matter still cannot be resolved.\"\n\nHowever, if the firm is not a member of the TSA - and it looks like Johnsons is not - then you have the option of taking the matter to the small claims court - or equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"If a company provides no information whatsoever regarding what you should do if you have a complaint, this is a red flag,\" Helen says.\n\n\"If a company does not recognise that mistakes happen and outlines what it will do if a problem occurs, it cares little for customer service or reputation.\"\n\nThis feature is not intended as financial advice - the aim is to give an overview of the things you should think about.

                "text": "The rate of inflation may have eased slightly but it is clear that UK households are facing a surge of rising costs ahead.\n\nAt an annual rate of 2.5%, the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation for the 12 months to December is well below the energy-led cost of living crisis peak above 11%.\n\nWhile that is obviously a relief, prices are still generally rising - just not as quickly.\n\nMoney latest: Reaction to inflation data amid warnings of rises ahead\n\nSome rising bills ahead that we know of will be inflationary while others could be - it's just too early to know given uncertainty hanging over the prospects for fresh Bank of England interest rate cuts and the effects of budget tax measures on employers from April.\n\nMarket jitters over the impact of Donald Trump's return to the White House, which in turn have intensified scrutiny and pressure on the UK's public finances, add to a complicated picture for the price outlook.\n\nSo where are the upwards pressures on costs in the UK all coming from? Here are 10 areas where they are likely, if not certain.\n\nEverywhere?\n\nIt's an unashamedly broad brush but it's important to recognise the fact that business lobby groups have widely warned of a price punishment since the budget, which put firms on the hook for \u00a325bn of tax rises announced by chancellor Rachel Reeves.\n\nIt means that from April, when measures such as higher employer national insurance contributions take effect, any business facing a higher tax bill could potentially pile that additional cost on to their customers.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:29 What's the outlook for grocery costs?\n\nIn shops\n\nWhen it comes to the subject of passing on budget tax hikes, retailers have been the most explicit about it.\n\nThat is because the likes of supermarket chains are among the country's biggest employers, with Tesco alone expecting a \u00a3250m hit per year over four years, amounting to \u00a31bn.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium has warned of food prices going up, rising by an annual rate of 4.2% by the year's end, while two-thirds of top bosses across the retail industry as a whole are planning to raise prices.\n\nAt banks and lenders\n\nEven after today's inflation data, financial markets are still only pricing in two interest rate cuts over the year to date mainly because inflation is forecast to rise in the months ahead.\n\nAnalysis by Pantheon Macroeconomics on Wednesday forecast a figure of 3.2% in April.\n\nHigher borrowing costs to help keep a lid on inflation mean elevated mortgage rates, in a year that is expected to see millions of households seek a new fixed deal.\n\nThere is also a risk the recent market turmoil, that has seen UK government long-term borrowing costs jump to levels not seen since 1998, pushes mortgage costs even higher.\n\nAny rises in so-called swap rates, which determine the cost of financing home loans for banks, are typically passed on to the borrower.\n\nOn imports\n\nA weaker pound - as recently witnessed during the market troubles - makes the cost of importing goods more expensive.\n\nSterling is currently 12 cents down on where it stood against the dollar at the end of September while it is more than two cents down on the euro.\n\nThe divergence in the falls tells you that the bulk of the pound's problems are more tied to dollar strength than pound weakness.\n\nIt can be explained by the fact that investors are worried about the impact of universal trade tariffs threatened by Mr Trump pushing up domestic inflation in the US.\n\nFuel bills\n\nThe pressure on the pound as part of the aforementioned market event means that a double whammy for fuel bills is imminent.\n\nA weaker pound, coupled with a rise in global oil costs which are priced in dollars, means that drivers are facing the prospect of further increases at the pumps beyond the 3p-a-litre seen since Christmas.\n\nBrent crude oil is currently standing at $80 a barrel - up from $71 just a month ago.\n\nEnergy\n\nEnergy bills have been on the rise since October when a 10% increase in the energy price cap took effect.\n\nWhile typical bills were up by a further 1% in January, further increases in wholesale prices in recent months are expected to be reflected in the cap from April.\n\nThe most recent forecast by industry experts Cornwall Insight saw a 3% hike from April to an average \u00a31,785, though recent cold snaps across Europe, coupled with weak storage levels, have pushed up natural gas contracts since.\n\nBenchmark British gas prices rose by 20% during the second half of December as colder weather led to higher demand across Europe. Weaker inventories will also mean that storage has to be replenished at a higher cost than seen after the previous, mild winter.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:30 Why your energy bills look set to rise\n\nWater\n\nIt was announced just before Christmas that the average annual water bill across England and Wales was to rise by 36% over the next five years.\n\nJust how much depends on where you live as the hikes vary by supplier. Southern Water customers face the heftiest increases from April through a 53% increase to \u00a3642 by 2030.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:31 Water bills 'an absolute disgrace'\n\nCouncil tax\n\nLocal authorities in England will be able to raise core council tax by up to 3% and the adult social care element by 2% in the coming financial year.\n\nNo final decisions have been taken across local authorities in Wales. In Scotland, where the bill includes water rates, rises of up to 10% are being considered by some councils after many years of frozen bills.\n\nMobile phones and broadband\n\nMost customers are on plans which have links to December's inflation rate.\n\nAnalysis by price comparison service uSwitch showed that mobile users faced average increases of \u00a315.90 a year from April while broadband bills would go up by a typical \u00a321.99.\n\nIt's worth noting, at this point, that the communications regulator has banned contracts linked to the rate of inflation in favour of a set price increase to bolster transparency.\n\nThis applied to new contracts from January.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nWhat about my ability to absorb price rises?\n\nThe good news here is that the pace of average wage growth has outstripped inflation since August 2023.\n\nThe trouble is, that has done little to make households feel better off in what is an evolving cost of living crisis.",

Pic: Blue Origin\n\nJeff Bezos and Blue Origin\n\n\"Ever since I was five years old, I've dreamed of travelling to space,\" Mr Bezos said ahead of his journey to the edge of space in 2021.\n\nHe founded the Blue Origin venture with the aim of having \"millions of people working and living in space\".\n\nFor years it has launched - and landed - its reusable New Shepard rocket to and from the brim of Earth's atmosphere, but has never sent anything into orbit. That could all change today.\n\nImage: Jeff Bezos, founder of Blue Origin and Amazon. Pic: Reuters\n\nBlue Origin will be hoping its New Glenn rocket will be able to compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9, the world's most active rocket.\n\nCompared to Mr Musk's Falcon 9, the New Glenn is about twice as powerful and its payload bay diameter is two times larger in order to fit bigger batches of satellites.\n\nThe upcoming launch is also a key certification flight required by the US Space Force before New Glenn can launch national security payloads as part of multi-billion dollar government tenders Blue Origin hopes to win.\n\nImage: A SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket lifts off in October 2024. Pic: Reuters\n\nElon Musk and SpaceX\n\n\"I want to die on Mars - just not on impact,\" Elon Musk once quipped.\n\nThe Donald Trump ally, who is frequently pictured wearing an \"Occupy Mars\" shirt, has enjoyed relative dominance of the private space industry through his company SpaceX.\n\nBack in 2016, Mr Musk outlined his vision of building a colony on Mars \"in our lifetimes\" - with the first rocket propelling humans to the Red Planet by 2025, though this deadline does not appear likely to be met.\n\nImage: Elon Musk and Donald Trump speak at a SpaceX launch in 2020. Pic: Reuters\n\nFor many years the company used an image of the Martian surface being terraformed (turned Earth-like) in its promotional material. However, a NASA-sponsored study published in 2018 dismissed these plans as impossible with the technology available then.\n\nSpaceX missions have included both US government contracts and launching the company's Starlink satellite internet network.\n\nAnd while Mr Bezos's New Glenn rocket is much more powerful than the successful Falcon 9, SpaceX's next-generation Starship, a fully reusable rocket system currently in development, would be more powerful still.\n\nMr Musk sees Starship as crucial to expanding Starlink's footprint in orbit. Its next test flight is expected later this month and will involve deploying mock satellites.\n\nRead more:\n\nNASA astronauts stuck in space 'don't feel like castaways'\n\nSpacecraft survives closest-ever approach to the sun\n\nImage: Sir Richard Branson.

So when bond prices fall, the yield - the effective interest rate - goes up.\n\nAnd for the last three months, markets have been selling off UK bonds, pushing borrowing costs higher. This week the yield on 30-year gilts reached its highest level since 1998 at 5.37%, and 10-year gilts briefly hit a level last seen after the financial crisis, sparking jitters in markets and in Westminster.\n\nWhy are investors selling UK bonds?\n\nBond markets are influenced by many factors but the primary domestic pressure is the prospect of persistent inflation, with interest rates staying high for longer as a consequence.\n\nHigher inflation reduces the purchasing power of the coupon, and higher interest rates make the bond less competitive because investors can now buy bonds paying a higher rate. Both of which apply in the UK.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nInflation remains higher than the Bank of England's 2% target and many large companies are warning of further price rises as tax and wage rises bite in the spring.\n\nAs a result, the Bank is now expected to cut rates only twice this year, as opposed to the four reductions priced in by markets as recently as November.\n\nNor is there much optimism that the economic growth promised by the chancellor will save the day in the short term, with business groups warning investment will be tempered by taxes.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:14 Sky News' Ed Conway on the impact of increased long-term borrowing costs as they hit their highest level in the UK since 1998\n\nIs the UK alone?\n\nNo. Bond markets are international and in recent months the primary influence has been rising borrowing costs in the US, triggered by Donald Trump's re-election and the assumption that tariffs and other policies will be inflationary.\n\nThe UK is not immune from those forces, and other European nations including Germany and France, facing their own political gyrations, have seen costs rise too. (The US influence could yet increase if strong labour market figures on Friday reinforce the sense that rates will remain high).\n\nBut there are specific domestic factors, particularly the prospect of stagflation. The UK is also more reliant on overseas investors than other G7 nations, which means the markets really matter.\n\nWhy does it matter to Reeves?\n\nThe cost of borrowing affects not just the issuance of new debt but the price of maintaining existing loans, and it matters because these higher costs could erode the \"headroom\" Ms Reeves left herself in her budget.\n\nHeadroom is a measure of how much slack she has against her self-imposed fiscal rule, itself intended to reassure markets that the UK is a stable location for investment, to fund day-to-day spending entirely from tax revenue by 2029-30.\n\nAt the budget, she had just \u00a39.9bn of headroom and some analysts estimate market pressure has eroded all but \u00a31bn of that.\n\nRead more:\n\nInfluential union leader announces retirement\n\nFood prices will rise due to budget tax hikes, retail body warns\n\nAt the end of March the Office for Budget Responsibility will provide an update on the fiscal position and market conditions could change before then, but if they don't then Ms Reeves may have to rewrite her plans.\n\nThe Treasury this week described the fiscal rules as \"non-negotiable\", which leaves a choice between raising taxes or, more likely, cutting costs to make the numbers add up.\n\nWhy does it matter to the rest of us?\n\nPersistently higher rates could push up consumer debt costs, increasing the burden of mortgages and other loans. Beyond that, the state of the economy matters to all of us.\n\nThe underlying challenges - persistent inflation, stagnant growth, worse productivity, ailing public services - are fundamental, and Labour has promised to address them.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nInvestment in infrastructure and new industries, spurred by planning and financial market reform, are all promised as medium-term solutions to the structural challenges.

I'm not actually on the frontline, but I can aid the frontline. I work with the Watchkeeper, which is a type of drone - it's pretty cool - and do surveillance and communications.\n\nYou start on just over \u00a325k... when you finish basic training. Specialist roles will pay extra, and as you move up the ranks you will get paid more. For example, as Lance Corporal you are looking at around \u00a330k.\n\nRead all the latest Money news here\n\nBut... the army also offers subsidised living. You can get breakfast for \u00a31.95, lunch for \u00a32.60 and so on. You'll probably find yourself living in a block of flats, a bit like a Premier Inn, with a room and an en-suite and you will be paying maybe \u00a3100 a month. The rooms aren't bad and you have other people living on your corridor, so you aren't isolated, which makes a difference because you can be living miles from home.\n\nAll you have to pay for is a mobile phone and internet... and the rest of the money is yours. So there is plenty of opportunity to save for your future.\n\nThe time off is pretty good... I get two weeks at Easter, three weeks of summer leave, two weeks at Christmas and then all of the bank holidays as well, so you can get into a really nice routine.\n\nI would recommend the army to women... You can get a lot out of it, and people don't always realise what is available. It is not quite as male-dominated an organisation, there are lots of female soldiers.\n\nSome army jobs require no GCSEs... while some require the standard two (English and maths), and some you may need five. If you're thinking of going down the officer route you will need 72 UCAS and 35 ALIS points, including a C/4 or above in some subjects.\n\nYou go from being a civilian to a soldier during basic training... It's a 13-week course and you're firing weapons, you are working on your fitness and learning how to act.\n\nRead more of this series:\n\nWhat it's really like to be a... publican\n\nWhat it's really like to be a... novelist\n\nThe most important skill... is being a team player. In my department, we have seven people, and if you are high ranking you need leadership skills, which the army teaches you, but you also need to be a team player because it is still just a small team.\n\nSome of the hardest days... are being sent on a promotion course. They include going out into the field because you are a soldier first. Both of mine have been in November, and it's cold and miserable but you have to have the mental resilience to push through it. If you fall into the negative, things don't work.\n\nYou get pension benefits after 12 years... so that was my first goal. Now I can see myself staying for my whole career - the army is a big place and it offers a lot of roles. I want to work as an army welfare officer... so if I do ever retire from the army I can retrain in that sort of field.\n\nYou get loads of qualifications for free... when civilians would have to pay. I've passed my summer mountaineering, I've done my army boxing coach level one course, adventure training. You really appreciate all the opportunities you get. I also took part in Project Convergence 2022, which took place in Death Valley in the USA, testing new technologies. Being deployed out in the desert, watching Elon Musk launch a satellite, hiring a car and going to Vegas for $20 - all of these wouldn't be possible in a normal civilian job.",

(2:16)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nPep Guardiola said Manchester City have one \"last chance\" to salvage their Champions League campaign after a 4-2 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain left the 2023 European champions facing a humiliating early exit from the competition.\n\nDespite taking a 2-0 lead early in the second half with goals from Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland, City surrendered their advantage and ended up losing convincingly at the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe loss means that City must now beat Club Brugge at the Etihad next Wednesday to reach the playoff round. Anything other than a victory will see City eliminated.\n\nBut after seeing his team outplayed by PSG, Guardiola had no complaints about the result or City's fate.\n\n\"We have a last chance against Brugge and if we don't go through it's because we don't deserve it,\" Guardiola told reporters. \"We have to recover against Chelsea in our next game and just move forward.\n\nPep Guardiola's previously all-conquering Manchester City team are enduring a difficult season. David Ramos - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images\n\n\"Tonight, they [PSG] were better. Congratulate PSG and accept it. The law of football is like that -- how intense and aggressive they were in key positions. You have to recover players and do it better.\n\n\"Their players suffered and they were better. They were better in the duels and we found our moment with 0-2 for the goal, but the first half they had two clear chances.\"\n\nCity surrendered a winning position for the ninth time this season and the defeat was their third successive away loss in the Champions League having previously gone 12 games on the road without a loss in the competition.\n\nAnd Guardiola said he felt City's defeat was due to being unable to dominate the game in midfield against PSG's energetic unit.\n\n\"When they had the ball, they dropped, but we created problems,\" Guardiola said. \"After 2-0 and especially 1-2 we could not play. You have to play with the ball and they were better.\n\n\"They had an extra man in the middle with the false nine and it was difficult. They were better. They had one more player in the middle and we expected with the buildup and to have more aggression. but they jumped back and squeezed really well and we could not make the process. The connection with Bernardo [Silva] and Kova [Mateo Kovacic] was not possible or not good and we could not make the process.\"\n\nGuardiola said Manchester City could not \"cope with\" PSG in the transition game.\n\n\"We had to defend with the ball and it's impossible to play well,\" he said. \"PSG played better in their games and couldn't win. Today they were able to. In the big stages, the big teams, we struggle. We have to accept it. Recover and go to Chelsea. We have to recover our game.\"",

It's the first time trying it out and I think everyone was a little bit confused how it would work when it first got announced, but playing in this format has been really interesting,\" the midfielder said.\n\n\"Playing big teams, coming up against different opposition, I've really liked it.\"\n\nRice scored the opener as Arsenal made it a virtual mathematical certainty that they will finish in the top eight of the 36-team group stage which this season replaced the established format of eight groups of four.\n\nThey are in third place with 16 points and in reality can already start planning for the knockout phase, even if manager Mikel Arteta could not bring himself to say it.\n\n\"We haven't been told. I know we're in a really strong position,\" the Spaniard said after Arsenal extended their unbeaten home run in Europe to 15 games.\n\nKai Havertz took his season's tally to 14 with Arsenal's second goal and Martin \u00d8degaard poached his first goal since November in stoppage time to wrap up a comfortable win.\n\n\"Overall, we got the job done and well done. We didn't concede a shot on target which is really positive again. It shows that the team is really well-rounded,\" Arteta said. \"Overall, scoring three goals, winning in the Champions League at home, another clean sheet at home -- four in a row -- and having made some changes as well.\n\n\"We rotated players that didn't play that many minutes and they responded really well.\"\n\nAvoiding a Champions League playoff will also guarantee the Arsenal squad some winter sunshine as Arteta said a break is now likely to recharge batteries seeing as they are already out of the FA Cup, which continues on Feb. 7-11.\n\n\"It was very helpful [last season] and with the schedule that we've had for the last three months, you can have a break, reset a little bit and work on things and rest some people, while some people are back, that would be great,\" he said.",

(2:20)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nMANCHESTER, England -- Ruben Amorim has said he regrets saying his Manchester United team might be the worst in the club's history and insisted he was pointing the finger of blame at himself rather than his players.\n\nAmorim made the comment in the aftermath of the 3-1 defeat to Brighton on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Wednesday, the 39-year-old clarified his statement.\n\nBut he went on to say he would be \"delusional\" if he didn't acknowledge that he has significant problems after a run of seven defeats from his 15 games in charge.\n\n\"First of all, I want to talk about that,\" Amorim began after being asked about his suggestion that this is the worst United team in history.\n\n\"I was talking more about myself than the players. I also said in the same response that I was not helping my players. If you look around every time I speak and every time you push about the players are not good enough, I never put the spot on my players.\n\n\"So I understand I give you that headline and I am frustrated sometimes. Sometimes I should not say it in those terms, but it is what it is and that's it.\n\n\"Sometimes it's really hard to hide the frustration in the moment. But the good thing is I said the same things in a different way in the dressing room five minutes before. The response was quite normal because I'm really blunt with my players.\"\n\nAmorim changed his normal routine after the defeat to Brighton, addressing his players in the dressing room immediately afterwards rather than waiting until the next day to hold his debrief.\n\nThere have been reports that the former Sporting CP coach was so angry that he damaged a TV.\n\n\"I'm a young guy and sometimes I make a mistake,\" Amorim said. \"And that's why I don't [usually] talk after the game. This game, I needed to talk and maybe it was a mistake and then I get more nervous and go to the [news] conference really nervous and say things I shouldn't say, that's it. Sometimes I'm a young guy and I make mistakes.\n\n\"I'm saying the obvious. If you want, I can be delusional and say different things. I said to the players and I said to you, I think it's a good thing to be really honest with you.\"\n\nUnited face Rangers in the Europa League at Old Trafford on Thursday having lost four of their last five home games.\n\nDuring the run, Amorim's team have put in good performances at Liverpool and Arsenal and he accepts that, at the moment, his players are finding it easier to play away from home.\n\n\"I could say different things and say no, no, it's the same thing, we have the support of the fans,\" he said.\n\n\"No, we are more nervous playing at home than away. We lost four games in five, so it's getting harder. But we can improve. If we don't suffer the first goal like in the fourth minute, 10th minute or 15th minute, it's really hard to calm down the team.\n\n\"The first thing in my mind is they cannot score, we need to score the first one. If we score the first one I think that will change and we will improve. It is really clear. We are really anxious, especially playing at home. It's getting harder for everyone to play at Old Trafford.\"\n\nUnited have conceded the first goal in their last five games at Old Trafford against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Southampton and Brighton.\n\nThey've also conceded first against Arsenal, FC Viktoria Plzen, Manchester City, Tottenham and Wolves since the start of December.\n\n\"The first goal against Forest was a set play and against Bournemouth, these aren't things that are tactical, they're about being focused,\" Harry Maguire said. \"We're not mentally focused to make sure we go the whole way. We know things can turn, tomorrow [against Rangers] is an opportunity to get a win and then go into Sunday [against Fulham].\"",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nPARIS -- Paris Saint-Germain pulled off a stunning comeback to overturn a 2-0 deficit and seal a 4-2 win against Manchester City that revived their UEFA Champions League qualification hopes and left Pep Guardiola's team facing a humiliating exit.\n\nTwo goals in three minutes from Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland at the start of the second half looked set to seal a comfortable win for City in Paris, but the home side roared back to equalise within seven minutes through Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Bradley Barcola.\n\nWith City on the back foot and struggling to cope with PSG's spirit and desire, Luis Enrique's team then won the game with goals from Jo\u00e3o Neves and Gon\u00e7alo Ramos on a famous night at Parc des Princes. PSG will now qualify with at least a draw away to VfB Stuttgart next week while City must beat Club Brugge at the Etihad to have any hope of reaching the knockout phase playoffs. -- Mark Ogden\n\nA magical night for the Parisians\n\nIt's another one of those European nights that PSG fans will never forget. Too often, the Parisians had been on the receiving end of comebacks in their recent Champions League history. It was them with their hearts broken after having taken the lead before wasting it, but not this time.\n\nThe game might not have been make-or-break -- as neither team could have been eliminated on Wednesday -- but it was nevertheless crucial, and PSG showed their character, talent, and personality. This team might not have the superstars and big world-class names anymore like Neymar and Lionel Messi, but showed great heart with their talent and their energy. They also have belief too, despite their young players.\n\nAt 2-0 down straight after the break, they could have collapsed, but they didn't. Their comeback could be a turning point in this European campaign, but they will have to finish the job next week in Stuttgart to qualify. -- Julien Laurens\n\nCity blow a lead and cave in yet again\n\nFor those who believed that Manchester City's recent mini-revival of four wins in five games had drawn a line under their slump of nine defeats in 12 games before Christmas, think again.\n\nGuardiola's team reverted to their old ways in Paris by throwing away a lead through complacency and a lack of being able to match the opposition for effort and desire. This was the ninth time this season that City had surrendered a winning position and failed to win the game. That is the reason they are now in such a hole in the Champions League.\n\nThere were so many issues against PSG. City lacked any kind of leadership once defender R\u00faben Dias was substituted at half-time due to being on a yellow card and close to a second one that would have reduced the side to 10 players, but they were also unable to match PSG for energy in midfield.\n\nDespite scoring, Manchester City's Erling Haaland was yet again underwhelming by his standards. (Photo by Alex Livesey - Danehouse/Getty Images)\n\nOut wide, Savinho was anonymous before being replaced by Grealish at half-time, and although the England winger scored one and made one within eight minutes of coming on, he did little else. Rico Lewis was poor at left-back and Matheus Nunes was out of his depth at right-back. However, despite all of the problems, with a 2-0 lead, City should have seen the game out.\n\nThis means that the crisis is back and City showed once again that their squad is nowhere near as good as it was two years ago. -- Ogden\n\nA tactical first half followed by an attacking second half\n\nGuardiola and Luis Enrique have been close friends for 30 years. They are the same age, they played together at Barcelona, they coached together and they ended up being two of the best managers in the world at the same time by sharing similar values, methods, and principles.\n\nOf course, they have differences in their personalities and their football, but when they faced each other tonight, we got what we expected: a very tactical first half, narrow lines, compact blocks, good pressing and counterpressing.\n\nBut between two attacking sides and full of talent going forward, there was no way this match was staying 0-0 after the break. And it didn't.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nMistakes were made and exploited, on both sides. When Manchester City were gifted two goals really by two ricochets off the Paris defence, the hosts scored their goals. They put the City defense under pressure, and in the second half, you got six goals, 23 shots (18 for PSG, five for City), nine on target, and more than three xG (expected goals) combined.\n\nAfter one of the best tactical halves of the season, the game flipped to one of the most spectacular halves of the season. -- Laurens\n\nHaaland needs to be more than a tap-in guy\n\nHaaland probably thought he had won the game for Manchester City when he scored a tap-in at the far post to make it 2-0 in the 53rd minute.\n\nWhen a striker scores the decisive goal in a game, he is entitled to feel like it is a job well done and bask in the plaudits, but when the game slips away from his team and they end up losing, he needs to ask whether he did enough to make a difference.\n\nplay 1:30 What did PSG prove in win over Man City? Alejandro Moreno reacts to PSG's win over Manchester City and what it means moving forward.\n\nAnd the reality in Paris was that Haaland didn't. Aside from scoring, Haaland did nothing. He was well marshalled by Marquinhos and looked nothing like a player who has just signed the longest contract in football by penning a new deal for 10 years. Haaland is unquestionably a ruthless goal scorer, but when he doesn't score, he contributes nothing.\n\nOther great strikers do far more for the team and bring others into play, but for now, Haaland is just a goalscorer. That surely cannot be enough for City to be successful in the years ahead? -- Ogden\n\nBarcola shows why he is PSG's star player this season\n\nBradley Barcola had only scored one goal in 16 Champions League appearances in his career before Wednesday, and if there was one game where he needed to step up to improve this stat, it was against Manchester City.\n\nThe adage that big games belong to the big players made sense for him. In a must-win game for Paris, they needed Barcola to be special. He has the talent for it, but so far, the top European competition was showing his limits. But his goal and his assist in a breathtaking second half, is the game that can change everything. The former Lyon winger and PSG's top goalscorer this season in all competitions, showed all his talent and potential.\n\nParis Saint-Germain achieved a comeback to defeat Manchester City 4-2 to keep their hopes of qualifying to the next round of the Champions League. (Photo by FRANCK FIFE/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"His season is exceptional so far,\" said Luis Enrique about his player at the weekend. It became even better on Wednesday night. -- Laurens\n\nIt's now win or bust for City\n\nManchester City are now fighting for Champions League survival and must beat Club Brugge next week to progress to the knockout phase playoffs.\n\nTheir 4-2 defeat in Paris saw the 2023 Champions League winners drop below the trapdoor of the top 24 teams and leave them facing an early exit from the competition if they fail to beat the Belgian side at the Etihad. Such a game would have been a formality not too long ago, but even though City will be favourites to clinch the win they need, Brugge need just a point to be certain of qualification.\n\nCoach Nicky Hayen has overachieved with his team this season, guiding them to wins against Aston Villa and Sporting CP as well as earning a draw against Juventus on Tuesday.\n\nAll three of those teams have beaten City this season, so City should be warned. -- Ogden",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAre we witnessing the end of Manchester City's incredible period of dominance, and have recent weeks exposed the first cracks in the winning empire built by Pep Guardiola? When the Champions League fixture list for the new 36-team league phase was released in September, nobody could have seriously predicted that Wednesday's clash with Paris Saint-Germain would be a make-or-break game for two of Europe's most powerful clubs. But that is exactly what it has become, with both sides in danger of not advancing to the knockout rounds.\n\nFor PSG, the club's decision to dispense with a policy of superstar signings (Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 left on a free transfer for Real Madrid in the summer) and focus on up-and-coming talent helps explain their unexpected slide in the Champions League, but Luis Enrique's team are still leaving domestic rivals trailing in their wake in France. Not only are PSG still on course for another Ligue 1 title, unbeaten in 18 games and leading second-place Marseille by 10 points, but they're alive in the French Cup and eyeing up another treble.\n\nIt is a different story at City. Having guided the team to an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season, Guardiola has endured a series of career lows as manager this season. City are miles off the pace in the title race -- 12 points behind leaders Liverpool, having played a game more -- and ended 2024 with just one win in 13 games in all competitions. That run included five successive defeats and an overall sequence of nine losses in 13 games.\n\nDespite three wins and two draws in their past five league games, Guardiola's squad are showing signs of age and decline. Right-back Kyle Walker, 34, wants to leave, while midfielder Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, also 34, has been a shadow of his former self since returning to the club from Barcelona last summer. Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, 33, is out of contract this summer and has yet to discuss a new deal.\n\nStar striker Erling Haaland's decision to sign a 10-year contract last week was an unexpected coup for City and a huge morale boost for all connected with the club, but there remains so much uncertainty around the Etihad.\n\nGuardiola's future remains the subject of speculation despite signing his own contract extension in November, City have lost their magic touch in the transfer market, opponents have lost their fear of Guardiola's once-formidable team, and the club are seeing homegrown players (including Cole Palmer and Liam Delap) exceed expectations with their new teams after perhaps being offloaded too soon.\n\nPep Guardiola and Man City have won everything there is to win since he joined the club in 2016, but is their time at the top coming to an end? Clive Rose/Getty Images\n\nEvery generation has a dominant team, but the empires built by Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s and Sir Alex Ferguson's winning machine at Manchester United were both eventually brought down and overtaken by rivals. Is the same now happening to City?\n\nRather than wait for the benefit of hindsight, their peers' stories suggest that the warning signs of the end may already be showing.\n\nWith additional reporting by Beth Lindop\n\nLiverpool: 'All the continuity left with Kenny Dalglish'\n\nIn September 1989, Liverpool recorded a 9-0 win against Crystal Palace at Anfield to go top of the old First Division. Having lost the league title on the final day of the previous season, it was an emphatic statement of intent that Liverpool, who had been crowned champions nine times since 1976, were back.\n\nLiverpool would go on to win the 1989-90 title, but it would be their last for 30 years, and it was another game against Palace that season that warned of the decline to come.\n\nIn an FA Cup semifinal at Villa Park in April 1990, Liverpool had been expected to cruise to victory over their relegation-threatened opponents, but manager Kenny Dalglish's team were beaten 4-3 after extra-time in a huge shock. In February 1991, Dalglish stepped down and the club would win just two trophies -- the 1992 FA Cup and 1995 EFL Cup -- for the remainder of the decade.\n\nFOR MORE ON THIS STORY This week's episode of \"The Football Reporters\" also examines this topic in even more detail, as Mark Ogden, James Olley and Rob Dawson discuss Man City's decline and are joined by Steve Nicol to look at how Liverpool's winning empire ended in the 1990s after two decades of dominance. Download the podcast here.\n\nThere were other key exits that contributed to the downward spiral. When John Smith stepped down as Liverpool chairman in 1990, the club had amassed 11 league titles, four European Cups, two UEFA Cups, three FA Cups and four League Cups since his elevation to the role in 1973. He was an understated local businessman who set the tone for Liverpool's approach on and off the field. \"We're a very, very modest club,\" Smith said. \"We don't talk. We don't boast. But we're very professional.\"\n\nIn tandem with the club's chief executive, Peter Robinson, Smith successfully appointed three managers -- Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish -- in the space of 11 years and sanctioned a series of astute signings including Dalglish, Graeme Souness, Ian Rush, John Barnes and Peter Beardsley, all of whom became club legends and key figures in successful teams. Liverpool also mastered the art of moving big players, including goalkeeper Ray Clemence and team captain Souness, out of the club at the right time.\n\nWhen Smith stepped down, the club soon started making mistakes with player signings and managerial appointments: Souness replaced Dalglish in 1991, leaving his role as manager of Glasgow Rangers as Liverpool abandoned Smith's approach of appointing managers from within the club.\n\n\"If you think about the continuity at Liverpool from Bill Shankly onwards, that all left with Kenny,\" former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol told ESPN.\n\nplay 2:07 Nicol pinpoints the moment Liverpool's era of dominance started to unravel Steve Nicol speaks about the game when he realised Liverpool's dominance was coming to an end in the 90s.\n\nAnother key factor in the decline was a failure to refresh an ageing squad, having successfully done so during the 1970s and '80s. When Dalglish stepped down, Liverpool were still reliant on many players who had delivered their success in the '80s, including Bruce Grobbelaar, Nicol and Ian Rush, who had all played in the 1984 European Cup final against AS Roma. Grobbelaar, Glen Hysen and Beardsley were all in their 30s, and Nicol and Rush were 29. Captain Alan Hansen announced his retirement at the age of 35 a month after Dalglish's departure.\n\nDalglish's final two signings, David Speedie and Jimmy Carter, would play just 21 games for the Reds between them, setting the tone for an erratic recruitment policy that followed. Throughout the 1990s, Liverpool fell into the trap of signing inferior players, often for inflated fees. The subtle art of making astute moves was lost.\n\n\"When Kenny left and Graeme came in, there were a few of us who were past our best,\" Nicol said. \"But even if that wasn't true, the place needed freshening up because a cloud was hanging over the club. Graeme had to make a lot of changes quickly.\n\n\"The majority of our team was made up of players who were Scottish, Welsh and Irish, so because of the UEFA rules [clubs were limited to three non-domestic players] Souness had to get rid of a lot of players and bring in English players. It wasn't like he had a choice of scouring Europe for the best players.\"\n\nLiverpool's fall was swift. By the time the Premier League began in 1992, they had fallen behind Arsenal and Manchester United and were also eclipsed by big-spending newcomers such as Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. It wasn't until Gerard Houllier's team won treble of League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001 that Liverpool became a force again. But despite a Champions League win under Rafael Benitez in 2005, it took the appointment of Jurgen Klopp in 2015 to provide the catalyst for the club to finally return to the summit of the English game.\n\nManchester United: The damaging post-Ferguson years\n\nManchester United's 6-1 defeat against Manchester City at Old Trafford in October 2011 was the biggest loss, home or away, since Ferguson took charge in November 1986. United went into the game as reigning champions, having won a 12th Premier League title in 18 years, but City were an emerging force under Roberto Mancini and they humiliated United at Old Trafford with goals from Mario Balotelli (2), Edin Dzeko (2), Sergio Aguero and David Silva -- three of City's goals came after the 89th minute.\n\n\"It looked humiliating, but it was actually self-annihilation,\" Ferguson wrote in his 2013 autobiography. \"After the final whistle, I informed the players they had disgraced themselves.\"\n\nThe margin of victory proved crucial, with City clinching the title on goal difference -- eight clear of United -- on the final day of the season and the 10-goal swing in City's favour from that derby proving decisive. \"Of all the setbacks I endured, nothing compared to losing the league to City,\" Ferguson said.\n\nFerguson was able to wrestle the title back a year later in his final season -- though United haven't won the title since -- but the 6-1 defeat was when the rot set in. Never before had United endured such a humbling defeat under Ferguson.\n\nplay 1:16 Why travelling with Ferguson at Man United was like being on 'Air Force One' Mark Ogden speaks about how Sir Alex Ferguson was treated when travelling with Manchester United on preseason.\n\nHis retirement in 2013 was the crucial departure, but David Gill's exit as CEO was just as significant. Gill had been the calm voice in the boardroom, the conduit between Ferguson and United's U.S. owners, the Glazer family, and his relationship with Ferguson was one of mutual trust.\n\n\"Of course, we have had a million arguments,\" Ferguson said about Gill in 2013. \"But I always enjoyed them because I know that David has two great qualities: He is straight, and he always puts Manchester United first.\"\n\nGill was replaced by United's commercial director, Ed Woodward, who oversaw a period of lavish signings as the club tried to spend their way out of the slump -- Paul Pogba (\u00a389.3m), Romelu Lukaku (\u00a375m), Angel Di Maria (\u00a359.7m) -- and the appointment of four managers in five years including Champions League winners Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho -- before he left his role as executive vice chairman in January 2022.\n\nUnder Woodward, United spent more than \u00a31 billion on new signings and over \u00a340m in severance packages to fired managers David Moyes, Van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Erik ten Hag's dismissal last November cost United a further \u00a310.4m in compensation to the former Ajax coach.\n\nUnited's failure to refresh their squad dates back to the summer of 2009, when Cristiano Ronaldo sealed a then-world record \u00a380m transfer to Real Madrid and the club chose not to turn Carlos Tevez's two-year loan deal into a permanent move, allowing the forward to move across town to Manchester City.\n\nWhile City were embarking on their own incredible spending spree, funded by their new Abu Dhabi owners, the United manager said he wanted to find \"value in the market.\" Ronaldo and Tevez were replaced by \u00a318m Wigan winger Antonio Valencia and Newcastle striker Michael Owen, who arrived on a free transfer. That summer also saw United sign relatively unknown forwards Gabriel Obertan and Mame Biram Diouf.\n\nplay 2:13 How Ferguson's legacy was impacted by the squad he left at Man United Rob Dawson and Mark Ogden reflect on Sir Alex's Ferguson's departure from Manchester United.\n\nUnited had tried planning for the long term by signing Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as successors to centre-back pairing Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. Mexico forward Javier Hernandez was signed for \u00a37m from Chivas in 2010, with \u00a37.2m spent to sign Portuguese winger Beb\u00e9 in the same summer. Meanwhile, Ronaldo would become a trophy-winning goal machine with Real Madrid, while Tevez became the poster-boy -- literally -- and catalyst for City's success on the other side of town.\n\nHowever, by the time Ferguson retired, the squad had started to show signs of decline. Ryan Giggs (39) was still playing in midfield, while Paul Scholes (38) had been persuaded to come out of retirement by Ferguson in 2012 to solve a squad shortage. Ferdinand (34), Vidic (31), Patrice Evra (32) and Michael Carrick (31) were all aging mainstays of the squad Ferguson handed over to successor Moyes.\n\nCompounding United's decline was the fact that Ferguson's judgement had also started to slip. After losing the title to City in 2012, Ferguson believed that his young players would deliver a bright future. \"I felt I had a core of players who were sure to improve,\" he said. \"In Rafael da Silva, Jones, Smalling, David de Gea, Tom Cleverley, Danny Welbeck, Hernandez, I had a nucleus that would be good for the long haul and a fit Anderson would be part of that group.\"\n\nHistory would prove Ferguson badly wrong.\n\nSo what are we seeing at Man City this season?\n\nFirst, the bad news for City: The pitfalls that befell Liverpool and United are already visible for Guardiola and his players. There have already been shock defeats, departures of key personnel, transfer mistakes, and maybe even some of the complacency that crucially obscured the warning signs at both Anfield and Old Trafford.\n\nWhen was City's \"6-1 moment?\" This season has thrown up plenty of shock results, but last season's FA Cup final was key. Chasing a Premier League/FA Cup double a year after defeating United at Wembley in the second part of their Premier League/FA Cup/Champions League treble, Guardiola's side were beaten by their neighbours, who had just recorded their lowest-ever Premier League (8th).\n\nplay 1:52 How Man City's 2025 transfers can prevent a falloff Rob Dawson says the transfer moves Manchester City make in 2025 will decide if they continue to be a Premier League title contender or not.\n\nHaving been so dominant on the domestic scene, City's defeat against a much weaker opponent highlighted a frailty that others would then expose more regularly. Liverpool and United had lost games before, but both defeats were big-stage failures when they were supposed to be at their best, and the same applies to City losing against United at Wembley. It was Guardiola's first, and only, defeat in a domestic cup final as City manager.\n\n\"It was my decisions [that cost us],\" Guardiola said afterwards. \"It's my mistake: the gameplan was not good.\"\n\nOff-the-pitch changes are also starting to have an impact at the Etihad; the question now is whether they prove to be as damaging? City have seen a number of senior figures leave the Etihad over the past 18 months, including chief operating officer Omar Berrada and academy director Jason Wilcox (who are now CEO and technical director respectively at United.) However, the biggest executive exit will be Txiki Begiristain, who has held the post of director of football since October 2012.\n\nBegiristain, a former Barcelona teammate of Guardiola's before becoming director of football at Camp Nou in 2003, will step down at the end of this season to be replaced by Hugo Viana, who has been recruited from Portuguese champions Sporting CP. Begiristain's presence at City was crucial in the club's move to hire Guardiola as coach in 2016 and the two men have an incredibly close working and personal relationship, even more deep-rooted and closer than Ferguson's was with Gill.\n\nThe loss of Begiristain's experience, contacts and, most importantly of all, his bond with Guardiola, could be a major blow.\n\nUntil recently, City looked to have avoided the squad pitfalls that proved to be the undoing of Liverpool and United. But after two relatively quiet summers in the transfer market -- City announced a profit of \u00a3139m from player moves in their most recent accounts -- Guardiola's squad are now in need of an overhaul due to the age profile of several key players.\n\nWalker (34), Gundogan (34) and De Bruyne (33) all need replacing, while Bernardo Silva, John Stones and Mateo Kovacic are all past their 30th birthday; Nathan Ak\u00e9, Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji are all 29. Despite the number of 30-somethings in his team, Guardiola has insisted that the age of his players is not an issue. \"It depends on the performance,\" Guardiola said in November. \"There are players who are 30 and more than 30 who perform incredibly well. There are players who are 23 who perform not good. I don't see the age. All teams have players with certain ages.\"\n\nHaving allowed Gundogan to leave for Barcelona as a free agent in 2023, City's decision to re-sign the midfielder last summer was a rare backward step for the club, but City have also sanctioned the departures of homegrown youngsters including Palmer (now at Chelsea), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa) and Romeo Lavia (Chelsea). The club have been sleepwalking into a major squad overhaul, but with the Premier League's 115 charges for financial breaches hanging over the club and Begiristain due to leave this summer, they may have left it too late to address the issue decisively as other issues become clear.\n\nSources have told ESPN that 22-year-old James McAtee, a player regarded by Guardiola as a potential replacement for Bernardo Silva, could be the next to leave due to frustration over a lack of playing time; Newcastle, Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig are all interested. Walker's surprise transfer request this month, and goalkeeper \u00c9derson's frustration at losing his starting spot to Stefan Ortega, have added to a rare sense of discontent within the squad. Meanwhile, Guardiola's increasingly agitated persona in the technical area has also raised doubts as to whether he will see out his new deal.\n\nHowever, there is some good news in the form of Haaland's new 10-year contract. For the club's biggest star to commit to such a long-term deal suggests there is optimism that this season is nothing more than a blip, and an unavoidable consequence of a team needing to be refreshed.\n\nCity have made signings to bolster Guardiola's squad in January, with deals for young defenders Abdukodir Khusanov (\u00a340m) and Vitor Reis (\u00a330m) set to be followed by the \u00a355m signing of Eintracht forward Omar Marmoush. But are they the right moves or a repeat of the gambles -- and mistakes -- made by Liverpool and United? Time will tell whether they are City's Jimmy Carter and Gabriel Obertan, or the new Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and R\u00faben Dias. If they are to avoid experiencing the same fall as Liverpool and United, City need them to be the latter.",

(1:48)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nIt's been a journey into the unknown, but the new-look 36-team Champions League is finally reaching the climax of the league phase.\n\nWhile we're starting to get some kind of idea of who's going to go through, a lot can happen in the final round. We only know two of the eight clubs that will go straight through to the round of 16, and 18 of the 24 teams who will be in the knockout rounds.\n\nThat said, nine teams have already been eliminated with only three more to come -- so jeopardy is limited.\n\nUnlike in previous seasons, no teams will drop into the Europa League from the Champions League.\n\nUnexpectedly, Man City are in real danger of being eliminated, which might not have been the case under the old format.\n\nLet's take a look at what's at stake and how the final matchday is shaping up.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe teams in position 1-8 go straight to the round of 16, and won't have to play games in February.\n\nThe clubs in places 9-24 will face the playoff round next month.\n\nThose in 25th to 36th are eliminated.\n\nDoes it matter where you finish in the table?\n\nYes, because the league placings create the knockout bracket. Unlike in previous seasons, where there would be open draws, paths will be set after this phase has been completed.\n\nThe new \"seeding\" system means the highest-placed teams can't face each other until the latter stages of the knockout round.\n\nFor instance, if we look at the table right now, Liverpool and Barcelona are in first and second and they would not be able to play each other until the final. The teams in third and fourth -- currently Arsenal and Inter Milan -- can't play Liverpool or Barcelona until the semifinals.\n\nHowever, the value of being placed high in the table has been complicated by poor European seasons for Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, who have unexpectedly become possible opponents earlier in the knockout rounds.\n\nThe teams in first and second will play 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th in the round of 16. A host of top clubs could yet finish in one of those positions, including Real Madrid (16th) and Juventus (17th).\n\nFinishing seventh or eighth is to be avoided, and that creates a direct collision course with first and second in the quarterfinals.\n\nWhat are the league phase tiebreakers?\n\n1 - Goal difference\n\n2 - Goals scored\n\n3 - Away goals scored\n\n4 - Wins\n\n5 - Away wins\n\n6 - Higher number of total points collected by league phase opponents*\n\n7 - Higher goal difference attained of league phase opponents*\n\n8 - Higher goals scored by league phase opponents*\n\n9 - Disciplinary points\n\n10 - UEFA club coefficient.\n\n*You add up the record of the eight teams faced in the league phase, effectively creating a difficulty level of opponents.\n\nManchester City will need to win their final league-phase game to make the knockouts. Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nWho is already through to the knockout rounds?\n\nRound of 16:\n\nLiverpool are through and are guaranteed to finish first or second, and thus take a top seeding position in the bracket.\n\nBarcelona have also secured a top-eight finish with a dramatic winner in a 5-4 comeback victory at Benfica.\n\nGuaranteed at least a place in the knockout playoff round:\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid, Atalanta, Arsenal, Bayer Leverkusen, Internazionale, AC Milan, Feyenoord, Aston Villa, Brest, AS Monaco, Lille, Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, Celtic\n\nHow it looks: the battle to go through\n\nBefore the competition began it was thought that 16 points would secure a place in the top eight, but the low spread of points at the bottom of the table means it could take 17 points to be absolutely certain of going through. It now looks possible to finish outside the top eight on goal difference with 16 points.\n\n1. Liverpool (21 points, goal difference +13)\n\nPSV Eindhoven (a)\n\nThe Reds are through and certain to finish in the top 2.\n\n2. Barcelona (18, +15)\n\nAtalanta (h)\n\nA direct place in the round of 16 is booked and they can finish no lower than sixth, though goal difference realistically means they will be top four.\n\n3. Arsenal (16, +12)\n\nGirona (a)\n\n4. Internazionale (16, +7)\n\nAS Monaco (h)\n\nArsenal and Inter could both still miss out on goal difference if they lose, but Arsenal are in a very strong position on +12. The Gunners would need to suffer a big defeat to Girona, or three of Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter, AS Monaco, Feyenoord, Brest or Lille would need huge wins to overtake them on 16 points.\n\nInter are slightly less safe with goal difference of +7, and if they were to lose by two goals at home to Monaco wins for Arsenal, Leverkusen and Villa could possibly put them into the playoffs. But they look good.\n\n5. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (15, +5)\n\nRB Salzburg (a)\n\n6. AC Milan (15, +4)\n\nDinamo Zagreb (a)\n\nA win for Atl\u00e9tico and Milan would send both clubs through to the round of 16.\n\nA draw could be enough, but it would place them right on the edge of qualification and into a goal difference battle on 16 points. Big wins for teams who are now on 13 points would put them in the playoffs.\n\nA loss is very unlikely to keep them top eight.\n\n7. Atalanta (14, +14)\n\nBarcelona (a)\n\nThe Serie A side's 5-0 victory over Sturm Graz has put them right in contention for the top eight.\n\nA draw could be enough ... but Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, AS Monaco, Feyenoord, Lille and Brest would need to fail to win.\n\nRealistically, Atalanta must win at Camp Nou to go through directly.\n\n8. Bayer Leverkusen (13, +6)\n\nSparta Prague (h)\n\n9. Aston Villa (13, +5)\n\nCeltic (h)\n\n10. AS Monaco (13, +3)\n\nInternazionale (a)\n\n11. Feyenoord Rotterdam (13, +2)\n\nLille (a)\n\n12. Lille (13, +2)\n\nFeyenoord Rotterdam (h)\n\n13. Brest (13, +2)\n\nReal Madrid (h)\n\nIt's a real hit and hope for all six sides on 13 points.\n\nWhat do their chances look like? Arsenal have far superior goal difference, while Inter, Atl\u00e9tico and AC Milan have favourable fixtures.\n\nDoes that mean there could be only one or two places open in the top eight if Atalanta stumble at Camp Nou? They must hope for shock results.\n\nLeverkusen sit eighth, while Villa are best placed to squeeze into it with their goal difference and decent home fixtures.\n\nLille and Feyenoord play each other, but both only have goal difference of +2.\n\nBrest would probably need a big win at home to Real Madrid to pull it off.\n\n14. Borussia Dortmund (12, +8)\n\nShakhtar Donetsk (h)\n\n15. Bayern Munich (12, +6)\n\nSlovan Bratislava (h)\n\n16. Real Madrid (12, +5)\n\nBrest (a)\n\n17. Juventus (12, +4)\n\nBenfica (h)\n\n18. Celtic (12,+1)\n\nAston Villa (a)\n\nAll five sides are assured of the knockout playoff round, and while mathematically they have a chance of making the top eight, it would take a crazy set of results to do so.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico Madrid and AC Milan must lose, and/or five of the seven teams from 7th to 13th fail to win.\n\n19. PSV Eindhoven (11, +3)\n\nLiverpool (h)\n\n20. Club Brugge (11, -2)\n\nManchester City (a)\n\nThese are only two teams who, mathematically, could make the top eight (everyone above would have to lose or draw), be in the knockout playoff round or go out.\n\nClub Brugge will be through if they avoid defeat at Man City. They are in a strong position with a loss, as to go out it would take Stuttgart vs. PSG to be a draw plus Benfica (away to Juve) and Sporting (home to Bologna) draw or win.\n\nPSV Eindhoven have a considerable buffer as they are five goals better off. It would take a huge loss, or a massive win for Dinamo Zagreb, along with those results for Stuttgart vs. PSG, Benfica and Sporting for the Eredivisie club to go out.\n\n21. Benfica (10, +2)\n\nJuventus (a)\n\n22. Paris Saint-Germain (10, +2)\n\nVfB Stuttgart (a)\n\n23. Sporting CP (10, +1)\n\nBologna (h)\n\n24. VfB Stuttgart (10, -1)\n\nParis Saint-Germain (h)\n\nAll four teams know that victory secures a place in the knockout playoff round. Club Brugge would be overtaken by Man City if they lose at the Etihad, and the Belgian club would then have to hope they are not overtaken by the clubs on 10 points. That would require Stuttgart vs. PSG being a draw and wins for both Benfica and Sporting.\n\nParis Saint-Germain effectively only need a draw vs. Stuttgart as Zagreb's goal difference is so inferior.\n\n25. Manchester City (8, +2)\n\nClub Brugge (h)\n\n26. Dinamo Zagreb (8, -8)\n\nAC Milan (h)\n\nMan City sit outside the top 24 but they are guaranteed to go through on goal difference with a win at home to Club Brugge. The only question is whether that would be at the expense of the Belgian club, or one of the teams on 10 points.\n\nDinamo Zagreb must win at home to AC Milan and hope at least one of Benfica, PSG/Stuttgart or Sporting lose. Make that two if Man City win.\n\n27. Shakhtar Donetsk (7, -6)\n\nBorussia Dortmund (a)\n\nShakhtar Donetsk have very slim hope. They would have to win first of all. Manchester City and Dinamo Zagreb must fail to win. And one of the teams on 10 points must lose with a big goal difference swing.\n\n28. Bologna (5, -5)\n\nSporting CP (a)\n\n29. Sparta Prague (4, -12)\n\nBayer Leverkusen (a)\n\n30. RB Leipzig (3, -6)\n\nSK Sturm Graz (a)\n\n31. Girona (3, -7)\n\nArsenal (h)\n\n32. Red Star Belgrade (3, -10)\n\nYoung Boys (a)\n\n33.

                "text": "Alex Kirkland explains why Real Madrid's five goals in a win over RB Salzburg may not have been enough. (1:09)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nMADRID -- Imagine being Rodrygo. At 24 years old, you play for Real Madrid -- the biggest club in the world -- and the Brazil national team. An outrageously talented forward, you've already won three LaLiga titles and two UEFA Champions Leagues, scoring some iconic goals along the way.\n\nBut you're not the team's star. Worse than that, you're not even second-fiddle. Or third best. You're fourth on the call sheet. Because you play with Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Jude Bellingham, and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who last year finished second, third and sixth in the 2024 Ballon d'Or voting. Rodrygo, notably, didn't even make the shortlist.\n\nOn Wednesday night at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Rodrygo gave another reminder of just what a gifted player he is, scoring twice in Madrid's 5-1 win over RB Salzburg. Both first-half goals -- which got Madrid back on track after a difficult start -- showcased the forward at his best, with elite, impossible-to-track off-the-ball movement, and unerringly confident finishing under pressure.\n\nIn the 23rd minute, Vinicius' ball over the Salzburg defence was aimed at Bellingham, but his mis-control found Rodrygo at the far post. The forward finished first time, across goal, past goalkeeper Janis Blaswich. It wasn't only Rodrygo's first chance of the game; it was Madrid's. And he made it count.\n\nRodrygo's second goal, 12 minutes later, was even better. Having drifted out to his favoured position on the left wing, he played the ball inside to Bellingham, who returned the favour, finding Rodrygo's driving run with a clever backheel. Rodrygo's first-time finish, curled into the bottom corner, screamed supreme confidence.\n\nThe forward's goal-scoring in the Champions League -- and the difference between his record in Europe's top club competition, and in LaLiga -- is so impressive that it's worth underlining. Rodrygo now has 22 goals in 57 Champions League appearances. That's a goal every two-and-a-half games, playing against the best teams in Europe. In LaLiga, he has 32 goals in 159 appearances, a goal every five games. In other words: Rodrygo scores twice as often in the Champions League.\n\nWhy? It's difficult to say, or at least to identify one primary factor. Perhaps European football, and the way Champions League opponents often set up against Madrid, looking to play, leaving space in behind their defences, suits him? Perhaps it's a question of mentality, focus and consistency, able to perform on the biggest stage in a way he's unable to replicate every week in LaLiga? The end result is a six-year spell at Real Madrid which already contains plenty of spectacular, career-defining images, while simultaneously feeling like it's still yet to really catch fire.\n\nWith three LaLiga titles, two Champions Leagues and a goal every two-and-a-half games, Rodrygo deserves far more plaudits than he gets. Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nRodrygo has played a part in some of the biggest, most dramatic moments in Madrid's recent history. Just think of his two goals in a minute against Manchester City at this stadium in May 2022, arguably the defining spell in that breathtaking run of Champions League comebacks. But when Madrid signed Mbapp\u00e9 last summer, it was Rodrygo's place in the team which was instantly, and understandably, questioned, with doubts over his long-term future.\n\nIn fact, coach Carlo Ancelotti has largely stood by him, determined to squeeze all four stars into the starting eleven, even when the side's balance is threatened as a result. Rodrygo has made 13 starts and four substitute appearances in LaLiga this season, with three starts and two sub appearances in the Champions League. On Wednesday, he started on the right. It's a position which does him no favours, limiting his effectiveness, but it's also the only spot available with Mbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius and Bellingham to accommodate.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nThe evening's second half -- as Salzburg's collapsed -- was a reminder why Rodrygo will never have the spotlight all to himself at the Bernab\u00e9u. Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius both scored, Vinicius twice; Mbapp\u00e9 after a goalkeeping howler, and Vini with two trademark finishes, in off the left wing. The headlines will be shared, Rodrygo a key contributor, rather than the main man.\n\nEven when Rodrygo was substituted in the 71st minute, replaced by Endrick, he didn't get a solo moment of glory. Mbapp\u00e9 was withdrawn by Ancelotti at the same time. The ovation from the Bernab\u00e9u crowd was shared, and as the two players left the pitch, it was Mbapp\u00e9's name the fans were chanting, not Rodrygo's.\n\nAfter the game, Vinicius seemed surprised to be told on Spanish television he'd been named MVP.\n\n\"I had the feeling that I wasn't able to play well in the first half,\" he said. \"'Rodry' deserved it.\"\n\nRodrygo was equally magnanimous.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"Here, we play for the team.\"\n\nHe'll be important away at Brest next week, in Madrid's last game of the league phase. Vinicius' yellow card against Salzburg means he'll be suspended for the trip to France. Rodrygo will slot into his preferred role on the left. If his European record is anything to go by, expect him to shine.",

We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nThe report on all matches from matchweek 17 is here.\n\nHere are the details for matchweek 18 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n\nBengaluru FC 2-3 Odisha FC\n\nOdisha FC boosted their chances of making it to the ISL playoffs, and dented Bengaluru FC again, with a 3-2 victory at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Wednesday. The result looked unlikely when Bengaluru went 2-0 up inside the first 13 minutes with goals from Edgar Mendez and Sunil Chhetri, but the game turned in the 26th minute when Bengaluru centre-back Aleksandar Jovanovic was shown a red card for a last-man tackle on Diego Mauricio, who scored the resulting penalty.\n\nMauricio scored from the spot again after Roshan Singh handled a cross from Rahul KP, and then Odisha took the lead early in the second half when Jerry Mawia turned in a cross from Hugo Boumous to complete the comeback. They saw off the rest of the game without too many concerns, as Bengaluru remained winless in 2025, losing three and drawing one of their four games in the calendar year so far.\n\nChennaiyin 0-0 Mohun Bagan\n\nMohun Bagan Super Giant were held to a 0-0 draw by Chennaiyin FC after an insipid performance from the league leaders in a largely uneventful game, which saw only three shots on target by both teams combined.\n\nIn fact, it was Chennaiyin who came closest to breaking the deadlock when Wilmar Jordan Gil somehow found space for himself in the box and hit the woodwork. Late in the second half, Chennaiyin skipper Ryan Edwards could, and really should, have won them the game after he was afforded a free header from point-blank range off a pinpoint Connor Shields cross, but he put his effort wide.\n\nBagan have extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points, having played a game or two more than the teams immediately below them. Chennaiyin are 10th, six points behind sixth-placed Mumbai City FC, who have played a game less than them.\n\nRead more:\n\nMatchweek 17 of ISL 2024-25\n\nMatchweek 16 of ISL 2024-25",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSince the ISL did something it does at times -- play for a couple of weeks without a break -- we muse today on matchweeks 16 and 17.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures\n\nHyderabad play a role in the title race\n\nJust how peak ISL is it that the team tripping up the challengers to the crown is the team that's farthest away from it? FC Goa and Bengaluru FC would have looked at their fixtures against Hyderabad and licked their lips -- before this, Hyderabad had taken just one point off the previous seven games, and that was off a hapless East Bengal. This would be a formality, they thought, a chance to keep up with (or even get closer to) Mohun Bagan.\n\nShameel Chembakath and his men had different plans. They travelled to the Fatorda, near as well matched them for possession (51% vs 49%) and shots on target (5 vs 4) in a battling display that saw them earn a deserved 1-1 draw. Ten days later they hosted Bengaluru FC and outplayed them in the final third (xG of 0.99 vs 0.46, 6 shots on target vs 1), and only lost two points to the belligerence of Sunil Chhetri.\n\nThose two results mean Goa are six and Bengaluru eight behind Mohun Bagan... and they may not be done yet. Up next, they host the unlikely challengers from Jamshedpur.\n\nBengaluru slowdown a concern\n\nBFC have played three games in 2025 and are yet to win one. What will concern them is how they've been unable to turn winnable positions against beatable opposition into tangible points. Against Jamshedpur, they had 1.61 xG vs 0.61 while against Mohemmadan it was 1.71 xG vs 1.16. Against Hyderabad it took a Sunil Chhetri masterclass in far post heading (he now has 10 goals in the league, what form!) to salvage a point in a game where their unfancied opponents were palpably better for the most part.\n\nHyderabad FC took points off FC Goa and Bengaluru FC. A.Suresh Kumar /Focus Sports/ FSDL\n\nHaving started the season with the bit between their teeth, BFC have slowed down to a jog now. For Gerard Zaragoza, it's imperative that they don't come to a standstill now -- that home fixture against Odisha on Wednesday is a big one.\n\nAre Jamshedpur the most dangerous threat to Mohun Bagan?\n\nIf they could play all their matches in Jamshedpur, in the stadium they call the Furnace, then definitely. At home, they've taken 22 points from a possible 27 (at 2.44 points per game); away, that's six points in six. They hosted Mohun Bagan and weathered a veritable storm before Stephen Eze channeled his inner Franz Beckenbauer to dribble from within his half to inside the Bagan box, and level things up with a lovely finish. That point is the first Bagan have dropped in four games.\n\nWhat will worry the Bagan faithful (alongside their hopeless conversion, underperforming xG massively in the last two matches) is what Jamshedpur did in their previous game. Travelling to Mumbai, they clinically dismantled the reigning champs 3-0, a sign that their travelling blues might be coming to an end. If they can keep this pressure up, they will emerge as the ones Bagan need to look out for the most.\n\nP.S. Mumbai City have lost three games 0-3 at home this season. It's really not been a good one for Petr Kratky and co.\n\nKerala Blasters make a late push under Purushothaman\n\nOver the last five games (i.e. since the sacking of Mikael Stahre), only Mohun Bagan have taken more points than Kerala Blasters. After taking just 11 points in their first 12 matches, they've taken 10 in these next five... and they've been accompanied by some decent performances. Their win against Odisha showed attacking resilience of the kind that was missing all season, while their backs-to-the-wall 10-men-for-an-hour effort to keep NorthEast United was a sensational show of defensive organization.\n\nNoah Sadaoui. Baranidharan M / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nThe fans continue to tussle with the management, as is their right considering what they've been seeing on the field, but TG Purushothaman and his assistant (and Blasters youth side coach) Tomasz Tchorz are shaping this team to be late, late contenders for a playoff spot.\n\nNorthEast seem stuck in a rut... where Odisha and Chennaiyin have been all season\n\n19 shots against the Blasters and zero goals, 16 against Goa for one, 11 against Punjab for one and a frankly ridiculous 25 against Mohemmadan for none... the past four matches have been an exercise in frustration for Juan Pedro Benali's (till then) high-flying NorthEast United. They had, after all, scored 29 in their previous 13 games and that was the one area he would have assumed wasn't going to be a problem for them. It is now, though, and they will need to find a way out of this rut if they are to fight off late challengers for their still nowhere-near-guaranteed playoff spot.\n\nThe gaffer sets his sights on the next one! \ufffd\ufffd\ufe0f#StrongerAsOne #8States1United pic.twitter.com/v2LFmWk00s - NorthEast United FC (@NEUtdFC) January 19, 2025\n\nSpeaking of ruts, hello Odisha and Chennaiyin. Odisha, in seventh, have five points in the last five and it's been a big fall from potential title challenger on paper to struggling to fight for the playoffs. Chennaiyin, even further back in 10th, also have five points in five and look stuck in a bog. Both teams have the managers, and the playing personnel, to do much better (especially Odisha, in terms of squad) but can they climb out of their ruts so late in the season?\n\nEast Bengal and Punjab FC continue to lose steam\n\nAcross November and December, East Bengal racked up four wins and two draws in seven games, their best run in quite some time in the ISL. January, though, has seen three losses in three, and they are back to languishing near the bottom of the table (11th now, three points off 10th and ten adrift off the playoff spots). While the losses may seem narrow on the surface (2-3, 0-1, 0-1), they were outplayed in all three and for a fanbase that demands so much more, this is turning out to be a season of yet more woe.\n\nPunjab, meanwhile, had a superb start to the season, winning six of their first nine games, but have now failed to win any of their last six (including four losses). The last two games have seen a bit of an uptick (two draws, even for the most part), but that head of steam they'd build up in the first half of the season has simply vanished. Panagiotis Dilmperis has to dig deep now to rediscover some momentum and make what is still a very plausible push for the top six.",
