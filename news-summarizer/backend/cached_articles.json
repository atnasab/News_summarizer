                "text": "For decades, patents have been a bone of contention in the technology world, seen by some as a way to protect intellectual property, but by critics as a blunt weapon against innovation. In the age of AI, they are once again getting revisited.\n\nNew York startup Patlytics has developed an AI-enabled patent analytics platform to help corporations, IP professionals and law firms streamline their patent workflows, from discovery, analytics, comparison, and prosecution to litigation.\n\nThe Google-backed startup said Monday it had closed $14 million in a Series A round led by Next47 with participation from existing investors, including Google\u2019s Gradient, 8VC, Alumni Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, and Myriad Venture Partners. Its Series A financing, which brings its total raised to $21 million, came roughly nine months after its previous seed round in April.\n\nCEO Paul Lee and CTO Arthur Jen co-founded Patlytics in January 2024. Former venture capitalist Lee saw that IP companies were using antiquated techniques when it came to working with patents: discovering, analyzing, and reporting on intellectual property \u2014 or building cases for patent-related work such as potential litigation \u2014 were all time-consuming, manual efforts. Jen knew the slow workflow firsthand, as he was previously responsible for managing the filing and protection of patents at Magic, a crypto wallet company he co-founded.\n\n\u201cPatlytics has an interesting genesis because I don\u2019t have a legal background, and I initially held a lot of misconceptions around legal tech,\u201d Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHistorically, there were many negative connotations and premises around selling technology to lawyers, but AI has truly changed these premises\u2026 What we\u2019ve seen in the IP market is that people want better technology; there is a big push for higher-value work using LLMs, and most importantly, patent professionals crave quality.\u201d\n\nPatlytics\u2019 large language models (LLMs) and generative AI-powered engine are custom-built for IP-related research and other work such as patent application drafting, invention disclosures, invalidity analysis, infringement detection/analysis, Standard Essential Patents (SEPs) analysis, and IP assets portfolio management.\n\nThe 1-year-old startup said it has seen a 20x increase in ARR and an 18x expansion in its customer base within six months, with a sustained 300% month-over-month growth rate. Patlytics did not disclose how many customers it has but said approximately 50% of its customer base are law firms, and the other half are corporate clients from industries like semiconductors, bio, pharmaceuticals, and more. Additionally, the company now serves customers in South Korea and Japan, and recently launched its first pilot product in London and Germany.\n\nIts clients include Abnormal Security, Google, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Richardson Oliver, Reichman Jorgensen Lehman & Feldberg, Xerox, and Young Basile.\n\nWith the Series A round, the startup plans to scale sales and increase its investments in product development. This includes hiring more engineers and expanding into different modules that the company offers. The startup has doubled its employees, increasing from 11 to meet customer demand since April 2024. Eric Lin, who has more than 10 years of experience as an IP litigator at law firms, including Paul Hastings, Morrison & Foerster, and Baker Botts, will join the Patlytics leadership team as vice president of strategy for the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\n\n\u201cPatlytics can automatically conduct technical discovery, generating detailed claim charts for validity and infringement purposes that would traditionally require expensive experts and countless attorney hours,\u201d said Bob Steinberg, Patlytics advisory board member and chair of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) Practice at Latham & Watkins. \u201cBy generating confidential, detailed, and unbiased analysis, Patlytics\u2019 goal is to ensure that parties involved in patent conflict resolution can have cost-effective access to critical information, helping to minimize gaps and discrepancies in understanding, facilitating negotiations, transactions, settlements and more efficient litigation.\u201d",

As the WSJ reports, the Oracle co-founder set out to reinvent agriculture on Hawaii\u2019s L\u0101na\u2019i Island, which he scooped up for $300 million back in 2012. Eight years and more than $500 million later, the project is still floundering.\n\nEllison dreamed of AI-powered greenhouses and robot harvesters feeding the world sustainably. Instead, Sensei has been tripped up by tech snarls \u2014 like Wi-Fi issues and solar panels battered by Lanai\u2019s winds \u2014 and rookie mistakes. Think greenhouses designed for Israel\u2019s desert climate, when L\u0101na\u2019i is typically muggy. The company also mixed mature and baby plants together, a blueprint for a pest paradise.\n\nSensei, co-founded by a medical doctor and led currently by a tech exec who runs Sensei from Boston, has had small wins, reports the WSJ. Its lettuce and cherry tomatoes now appear at the island\u2019s few local markets and restaurants. But constant delays, leadership shake-ups, and pricey blunders, including cannabis grow houses that needed to be gutted and rebuilt, highlight a tough truth: even bottomless funding is no match for the hard lessons of a specialized industry.\n\nAbove: Larry Ellison and his co-founder in Sensei Farms, David Agus",

When students text their questions to Sonny, the AI suggests a response, but it\u2019s humans who are ultimately responsible for the message.\n\nSonar signed its first school partnership in January 2024 and says it\u2019s now available to more than 4,500 middle and high school students across nine districts. The company says the chats are currently being monitored by a team of six people with backgrounds in psychology, social work, and crisis-line support.\n\nCEO Drew Barvir told the Journal that he makes it clear to students and schools that Sonny isn\u2019t a therapist and that Sonar staffers will work with schools and parents to find therapists for students when appropriate.\n\nA big reason why this approach might appeal to school districts is a current shortage in counselors \u2014 the Education Department says 17% of high schools don\u2019t have a counselor at all.",

The financial services giant alleges that Javice helped \u201cfake millions of customers in order to induce the bank to buy her company,\u201d student financial planning aid startup Frank, for $175 million. That charge was also the root of an SEC complaint, which charged that Javice \u201cmade numerous misrepresentations\u201d about Frank\u2019s purported millions of users to entice JPMorgan.\n\nJPMorgan claims that it found out about the alleged fraud when more than 70% of marketing test emails to a list of Frank\u2019s customers bounced back.\n\nJavice\u2019s attorneys claim that JPMorgan did ample diligence and this suit is a result of buyer\u2019s remorse due to a government change in the way financial aid forms are filled out; they say alleging fraud was a way to get out of the deal.\n\nJavice, now 32 years old, could be sentenced to numerous years in prison if she\u2019s convicted of deception and creating fake data.\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

This week confirmed this, and it confirmed that unicorn rounds are not dead.\n\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\n\nImage Credits:Natalie Christman / Humane\n\nAs happens often in the startup world, it\u2019s been a week of beginnings and endings.\n\nThinking machines: Thinking Machines Lab, the new AI startup of former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, came out of stealth this week, without confirming how much it may have raised from VCs. Meanwhile, Ilya Sutskever\u2019s startup Safe Superintelligence (SSI) is reportedly raising around $1 billion.\n\nHumane killing: Humane, the hardware startup behind the flawed AI Pin, announced that most of its assets have been acquired by HP for $116 million.\n\nMoney back guarantee: San Francisco-based startup Future Family launched a new IVF insurance product in the United States that could refund prospective parents if treatment doesn\u2019t succeed after two rounds.\n\nLow battery: Former Silicon Valley darling Nikola Corp. filed for bankruptcy this week. The hydrogen electric trucking startup failed to find a buyer or secure additional funds to maintain operations.\n\nMost interesting VC and funding news this week\n\nImage Credits:Saronic\n\nWe thought the days of counting unicorns were behind us, but not so much. Plus, legal AI is hot, and looming budget cuts inspired a new biotech venture fund.\n\nQuadricorn: Austin-based defense startup Saronic raised a $600 million Series C to build an autonomous ship factory, also quadrupling its valuation to $4 billion from its last round.\n\nNew horn: Six months after raising a $150 million Series C at a $1.25 billion post-money valuation, AI coding startup Codeium is in talks to raise a new round led by Kleiner Perkins at a $2.85 billion valuation, sources told TechCrunch.\n\nJoining the club: Hightouch, a startup co-founded by a former engineering manager at Segment that provides AI-powered marketing tools, closed an $80 million Series C round at a $1.2 billion valuation.\n\nStill in the club: Augury, whose AI-based hardware detects malfunctions in factory machines, secured $75 million in equity funding as part of a Series F round that it is still closing.

                "text": "Tiny Michigan biotech startup CircNova has raised a $3.3 million seed round for its technology that uses AI to target \u201ccircular RNA.\u201d The development holds promise as a new method to quickly develop therapies for conditions that currently have no drug treatments.\n\nThe new funding is also a victory lap for co-founder and CEO Crystal Brown, who took an unconventional path to becoming a biotech founder.\n\nRNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a key molecule that helps convert genetic information into proteins. Circular RNA is a relatively newly discovered class of such structures that form a circle rather than a strand. It regulates critical biological processes, and the hope is that therapies based on these molecules will be able to target complex health issues.\n\nCircNova has developed a \u201cproprietary AI engine that allows us to identify, design, and then produce novel, non-coding, circular RNAs,\u201d Brown told TechCrunch.\n\nIt\u2019s an AI engine similar to Google\u2019s DeepMind AlphaFold, in that it also uses deep learning AI \u2014 not some kind of large language model \u2014 to generate and analyze new circular RNA for therapeutic use.\n\nCircNova has not only its NovaEngine, which it says is the first in the world to be able to predict circular RNA structures, but it also has a wet lab. That means its AI engine produces the actual physical molecules themselves, which can then be validated and researched in collaboration with the University of Michigan, Brown said.\n\n\u201cWe can reverse engineer. We can go from sequence to structure. We can go from structure to sequence when developing the molecule,\u201d she says.\n\nThe goal is to \u201ctreat diseases we haven\u2019t treated so far, things like ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic diseases,\u201d she describes.\n\nThe tech is based on the work of CircNova co-founder Joe Deangelo, the startup\u2019s chief scientific officer and previous CEO of biotech Neochromosome as well as the former CSO of Apex Bioscience. Investor William Grenawitzke is chief business officer and the startup\u2019s third co-founder.\n\nLessons from a failed startup\n\nBrown seems like an unlikely founder of such a company because until about seven years ago, her career had been in the automotive manufacturing industry.\n\nShe thought she was climbing the ladder to become a \u201cC-suite automotive executive\u201d when a friend of hers introduced her to a CEO running a life science startup. The startup CEO was looking for a business manager.\n\nCurious, Brown offered to keep the books part-time, which evolved into her bringing business tactics from auto factories to help the startup, like overhauling their business contracts.\n\nShe peppered the team with questions about the science until some of her friends told her she should quit automotive and work full-time in biotech.\n\n\u201cI was like, no one\u2019s gonna take me seriously. I\u2019ve never studied biology. I studied poli sci and women\u2019s studies,\u201d she recalls.\n\nBut she made the leap anyway, taking a massive pay cut from her well-paying six-figure job to what amounted to intern-level pay. She learned about startups, raised money, and worked her way up to director of operations. The company went public, giving her a healthy enough payout to buy a house, she said.\n\nFlushed with success, she launched a biotech startup of her own, a contract research lab.\n\nShe raised money, then made all the classic first-founder mistakes. \u201cI hired people too quickly. I opened up my lab,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo years in, her startup burned through its funds, and she knew she had to shutter it. It broke her heart and her bank account. She even lost her house, she recalled.\n\nBut she had gained a stellar reputation in Michigan\u2019s tight-knit startup community and Brown recalls that VCs told her, \u201cYou\u2019re a good founder anyway.\u201d Several said they\u2019d be open to funding her next idea.\n\nKnowing she would soon be available for a new venture, Deangelo began sending her scientific material on circular RNA. He had an idea for how to use it with AI drug discovery.\n\n\u201cHe started sending me, literally every morning at 5:30 \u2026 five to 10 articles,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even shut the other company down all the way.\u201d\n\nBut she studied up and grew convinced this idea could work. They founded CircNova in May 2023.\n\n\u201cI went into it very cautiously, throwing just a few things at the wall. What can I do with the $15,000 grant to get it started?\u201d\n\nThat first expenditure developed the startup\u2019s first process and another $25,000 from a National Science Foundation grant led to the first patent application.\n\nShe began to split her time between Michigan and Boston, near her customers and wish-list customers like Moderna and Pfizer.\n\nAs for betting on Brown again, VCs like Nia Batts, a general partner at Union Heritage Ventures, had no problem with it.\n\n\u201cWe are no stranger to the resilience that is needed when you engage in the journey of entrepreneurship,\u201d Batts said, adding that she knew she wanted to back this new venture \u201cthe moment\u201d she met Brown and heard about the idea.\n\nThis $3.3 million seed round was led by diversity-focused VC South Loop Ventures and includes investment from Dug Song, Union Heritage, Michigan Rise, Invest Detroit, Kalamazoo Forward Ventures, and SPARK Capital.",

                "text": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk surveyed his followers on X \u2014 the platform he spent $44 billion to buy \u2014 asking whether federal employees should be required to send his team an email with a list of five things they accomplished this week. With the yes votes totaling over 70%, Musk followed through. Federal employees received an email from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) this weekend, requesting their weekly list of accomplishments by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\n\u201cConsistent with [President Donald Trump\u2019s] instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cFailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d\n\nWith millions of employees across the federal government, the DOGE-operated email address and the contents of the email were bound to leak. As federal employees are threatened with losing their jobs, people on social media platforms like Reddit, TikTok, Threads, and Bluesky are calling on each other to spam the now-public email address with nonsense.\n\nThis is a common tactic of online resistance when something like a controversial form for public comment or email address gets out.\n\nIn one case, so many people sent the complete script of the \u201cBee Movie\u201d \u2014 a recurring internet joke \u2014 to an anti-trans \u201csnitch form\u201d in Missouri that the tip line was taken offline. People responded similarly to a Texas state inbox tracking gender marker changes on driver\u2019s licenses, as well as an anti-trans bathroom complaint form in Utah.\n\nThis online vigilantism sometimes coalesces within particular communities, like the K-pop fandom. In 2020, Dallas police requested that people send them videos of illegal activity taking place during protests following the police killing of George Floyd; instead, fans of Korean superstars like BTS spammed the police department\u2019s app with nonsensical fancam videos.\n\nTrump\u2019s detractors have employed these tactics since the first week of his term, when his administration set up dedicated email accounts requesting that employees report noncompliance with the president\u2019s executive orders to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Workers were threatened with imprecise \u201cadverse consequences\u201d if they withheld information about efforts to \u201cobscure the connection\u201d between DEI initiatives and government contracts.\n\nThough OPM is a long-standing government agency, these specific email addresses are new. Federal employees first received an email from the OPM\u2019s HR email address in January, testing whether it could be used to contact all government workers in one email blast. This move sparked a class-action lawsuit from two whistleblowers who claim it violates federal privacy law to create this brand-new email server without following established security measures.\n\nThese security protocols are in place for a reason. In 2015, the OPM was hacked, compromising sensitive data from security clearance background checks for 21.5 million people. That included the Social Security numbers of each of these individuals, as well as biometric data from 1.1 million people. Musk\u2019s DOGE team, meanwhile, has been granted unprecedented power and broad access to these government systems with little resistance.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how effectively DOGE will be deterred by this mass spam campaign. Since ordinary people do not have .gov email addresses, it\u2019s possible that Musk\u2019s team could just filter their inboxes for government-only email addresses. The inbox could also collapse under the sheer volume of mail it will receive; if Musk\u2019s DOGE team is using a physical server, then the amount of data it can contain is finite.\n\nThough it\u2019s possible these efforts could be futile, people who resist Musk\u2019s policies are not deterred \u2014 after all, it doesn\u2019t take very long to copy and paste the complete script of the \u201cBee Movie\u201d into an email.",

                "text": "SpaceX said Monday that last month\u2019s Starship explosion was brought on by a cascading series of events caused by propellant leaks \u2014 a problem the company says has been addressed ahead of an eighth test flight that could happen as early as Friday.\n\nThe spaceflight company is still waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to either officially close the \u201cmishap investigation\u201d into the explosion, or specially authorize SpaceX to perform the flight while the investigation continues.\n\nThis is, notably, the first time SpaceX has been subjected to a mishap investigation while CEO Elon Musk is operating inside the United States government, with workers from his so-called Department of Government Efficiency actively making changes at the FAA. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s January test of Starship started off fine enough. The company was hoping to test out a number of upgrades to the Super Heavy booster, the launch-and-catch tower, and on Starship itself. The heavy-lift rocket system launched without any problem and headed off to space, with the booster eventually separating and coming back down to the ground in Texas where it was caught by the tower.\n\nThe problems started about two minutes after Starship ignited its own rocket engines to get to orbit. The company wrote in a blog post that \u201ca flash was observed in the aft section of the vehicle near one of the Raptor vacuum engines.\u201d Sensors onboard the ship started picking up a rise in pressure after the flash \u201cindicative of a leak\u201d of propellant, according to SpaceX.\n\nAnother flash was seen two minutes later, and SpaceX says \u201csustained fires\u201d began in that section of Starship due to the leaks. The fires caused \u201call but one of Starship\u2019s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences and ultimately led to a loss of communication with the ship.\u201d\n\nSpaceX says the leaks were most likely caused by vibrations that exceeded what the company expected from testing, \u201cwhich led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.\u201d The automatic in-flight abort system eventually triggered the destruction of the ship following the fires and communications blackout.\n\nThat explosion led to a spectacular display over the islands of Turks and Caicos, and also resulted in the FAA diverting a number of flights to avoid any danger. SpaceX claims that all of the Starship debris \u201ccame down within the pre-planned Debris Response Area\u201d \u2014 a sort of safe-zone that it typically negotiates ahead of flights with government agencies. Residents have been posting photos of debris washing up on beaches and at least one vehicle was struck, receiving minor damage.\n\nSpaceX says it has made changes to the lines that send fuel to Starship\u2019s engines, tweaked the temperature of the propellant, and has added extra vents and \u201ca new purge system\u201d to make the aft section in question \u201cmore robust to propellant leakage.\u201d",

On Monday, Apple laid out its own plans in that area: It will spend $500 billion over the next four years in areas like high-end manufacturing, engineering, and education covering technologies like artificial intelligence and chip making.\n\nBig projects will include a new factory in Houston, Texas, to produce servers that support Apple\u2019s in-house AI effort, Apple Intelligence; doubling the value of Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion; a new academy in Michigan to train people to work in next-generation factories; and more R&D.\n\nSome of this is not \u201cnew\u201d news. Apple has worked for years with thousands of suppliers across the U.S. in areas like chip making \u2014 currently 24 factories across 12 states \u2014 alongside directly employing people in the country. Globally, Apple employs 164,000 people, according to recent filings. It does not break out how many of them are in the U.S. specifically. It said today it plans to hire another 20,000 people in the next four years. But again, it does not specify if these people will be in the U.S. or elsewhere.\n\nNevertheless, Apple\u2019s news is significant because of what it underscores. First, there is the bigger effort that the U.S. has been making to expand its economic footing, specifically to remove some of the reliance that the U.S. currently has on ecosystems outside of the U.S. itself, such as China for manufacturing. The U.S. is waging a fairly drastic effort to shift investment in line with that, for example, by floating new tariffs on certain goods in an effort to drive more national production.\n\nThe magic number is $500 billion: It\u2019s also the amount that SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI are apparently committing to their own major AI data center project.\n\nApple, as a major consumer electronics company, relies heavily on production outside of the U.S. The exercise of laying out plans to invest within the U.S. will not completely replace that, now or ever, but becomes a bone \u2014 a very valuable bone \u2014 that it can throw to show that it\u2019s making efforts too.\n\nSecond, the focus on artificial intelligence in Apple\u2019s news today should be noted. The major server factory that it will be building will be focused on building machines that can handle AI compute. Similarly, the ecosystem fund and training budget are largely focused on skills and manufacturing of hardware that will be used in AI systems.\n\nOf note: It is not clear what kinds of tax breaks (if any) companies will get on the investments such as the ones Apple listed today. That will be top of mind for companies, their investors, and hopefully the U.S. public. Apple did note that it \u201cremains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\u201d\n\nThe news today, in any case, is being represented as Apple\u2019s own commitment to growing America\u2019s industry profile in the world.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, in a statement. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\n\nOne of the bigger specific projects announced today will be a new 250,000-square-foot AI server manufacturing facility in Houston \u2014 taking on building services that up to now have been manufactured in other countries. Ground breaks later this year, and it will be completed by 2026, it said.\n\nThe project is important not just in value but also intention: Apple is doubling down on how it believes AI will be used within its products and services. So the project is coming along with an expansion of server capacity in Apple\u2019s other data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\n\u201cTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers,\u201d Apple said, although it also claimed these are already run on renewable energy.\n\nThe manufacturing fund, in contrast, will be used to help finance expansions for its partners, including a \u201cmultibillion-dollar commitment\u201d to TSMC for advanced silicon made in the latter company\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple said it is Fab 21\u2019s largest customer.\n\nApple has not specified how much it has earmarked for educational initiatives aimed at training workforces \u2014 although the costs of building factories or investing in frontier-level research and development are likely to be substantial.\n\nThe first effort in that vein will be a new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, it said, where \u201cApple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State,\u201d will work in consultation with SMBs to help them implement \u201cAI and smart manufacturing techniques.\u201d There are a large number of smaller businesses in that region that have worked in concert in other legacy industries like automotive, and it will be worth watching to see how and if they make the transition as envisioned.",

                "text": "In Brief\n\nGoogle has quietly revealed the pricing of Veo 2, the video-generating AI model that it unveiled in December.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s pricing page, using Veo 2 will cost 50 cents per second of video, which adds up to $30 per minute or $1,800 per hour. Google DeepMind researcher Jon Barron contrasted this pricing with the blockbuster Marvel movie \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d which had a reported production budget of $356 million \u2014 or around $32,000 per second.\n\nOf course, customers aren\u2019t necessarily going to use every second of Veo-generated video that they pay for, nor is Veo 2 likely to generate three-hour \u201cAvengers\u201d epics anytime soon (Google\u2019s announcement highlighted Veo 2\u2019s ability to create clips that are two minutes or more).\n\nAnother price to compare: OpenAI recently made its Sora video generation model available to subscribers paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro subscription.",

                "text": "\u201cLucky me,\u201d I thought as I navigated the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 into the last spot of a Tesla Supercharging station in Palm Springs.\n\nThe EV didn\u2019t really need any juice. But this refreshed compact all-electric SUV comes equipped with Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard port; it was time to test out how well Hyundai would match up with the Tesla Supercharging network.\n\nThe experience exposed a gap \u2014 in the literal sense. And while Hyundai shouldn\u2019t shoulder all the blame, it did illustrate how a seemingly good idea doesn\u2019t always translate in the real world.\n\nFor example, I reversed into the parking spot, opened the charge port on the passenger-rear quarter panel, and grabbed the charging cord, nestled in the cabinet sitting all the way over on the driver\u2019s side of the car.\n\nUh, Hyundai, we have a problem. It didn\u2019t reach.\n\nI could wait for another Tesla to vacate its space and use that charging cable, essentially taking up two spaces, or I could use the in-car navigation to find a CCS-equipped charging station and use the adapter that comes with the car.\n\nI chose to toddle on with my day as I had plenty of battery, but others might not be so lucky.\n\nImage Credits:hyundai\n\nCCS, or Combined Charging System, was the standard in North America and used by every automaker except for Tesla, which developed its own port and charging station called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS.\n\nAutomakers began to shift to NACS in May 2023 after Ford reached an agreement that would give owners of its EV access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. GM followed and within six months nearly every automaker had struck a similar deal with Tesla. Access would initially be accomplished with a Tesla adapter, but most of these automakers \u2014 Hyundai and Kia included \u2014 also agreed to integrate the NACS charging tech into their future EVs.\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of these.\n\nOf course, not all of this is Hyundai\u2019s fault. The Ioniq 5 has always had its charging port on the rear passenger side, and moving it would be a spendy proposition. And Tesla says the problem should be solved with the rollout of its V4 charging stations with longer cables, although its website says, \u201cwe encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side.\u201d\n\nBuyers of the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have better luck finding a CCS station and using the adapter. Hyundai says the Ioniq 5 can go from 10% to 80% of charge in about 20 minutes at a CCS charger. The same fill-up will cost you up to 30 minutes at an NACS charger.\n\nHyundai makes it a bit easier with your choice of a $400 charging credit or a free ChargePoint home charger with the purchase of an Ioniq 5 and those with an older Hyundai EV with a native CCS port can get a free NACS adapter through the MyHyundai owner portal starting in March.\n\nHyundai owners will also have access to the planned Ionna charging network. The Ionna network, which is expected to have 30,000 NACS and CCS charging points by 2030, is a collaboration between BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Stellantis, and Toyota.\n\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5: Bigger batteries, more range, new trim\n\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5, which will come in SE, SEL, XRT, and Limited trims in rear- or all-wheel drive, may look like its previous model years. But there are some key differences, starting with the battery size.\n\nThe standard range battery ratchets up 5 kWh to 63 kWh, while the extended range sits at 84 kWh, an increase of 6.6 kWh. Depending on the combination of drivetrain, battery, and trim, expect to see 245 miles of range on the low end and up to 318 miles of range for a rear-wheel-drive Ioniq 5 with the larger battery.\n\nPower output varies, too, starting with 168 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, growing to 225 ponies in the extended range battery. The most powerful setup settles in at 320 horsepower and 446 pound-feet of torque for all-wheel-drive cars with the bigger battery.\n\nTech upgrades\n\nImage Credits:hyundai\n\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5 has some new parlor tricks too.\n\nThe digital key function now works with your phone inside a pocket or purse, a nice upgrade for when you\u2019re juggling kids, groceries, and a drink.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are now wireless and all models have over-the-air updates.\n\nAdditionally, Hyundai Pay allows owners to add their credit card to the infotainment system to pay for reserved off-street parking automatically. Drivers also get updated blind-spot collision avoidance and parking assistance.\n\nLet\u2019s get dirty\n\nImage Credits:Hyundai\n\nFor those wanting a bit more adventure with their electric SUV, the Ioniq 5 now comes in the XRT trim.\n\nThis model is designed for venturing off the path just a bit thanks to a one-inch lift and 29-inch Continental CrossContact ATR tires for better performance in the dirt and over gravel. This model also gets a Terrain button on the steering wheel that offers up modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand.\n\nHyundai let me loose on a fun dirt loop and I found that the car has enough playfulness in it to induce a grin. Sand mode doesn\u2019t turn the traction control all the way off \u2014 you have to manually push the traction control button to do that. It does adjust the brake regen properties so the vehicle doesn\u2019t automatically start to slow down when you lift. It also splits the torque 50/50 for optimal traction.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to toss it into corners and get a little slidey, but the ABS system \u2014 while great on pavement \u2014 can interfere with traction and off-road stopping distances by not allowing any dirt to build up in front of the tire.\n\nImage Credits:Emme Hall\n\nIt would be great if the drive modes also tweaked this system. Still, the instant electric torque means it\u2019s easy to get on the throttle and power out of a turn and scream toward the next one, slinging dirt rooster tails in the process.\n\nThe XRT is not some kind of rock crawler. The total ground clearance is only seven inches \u2014 that\u2019s two inches less than a Subaru Forester Wilderness. The off-road geometry, while better than the Toyota RAV4 Woodland Edition, is meant more for small obstacles and undulations.\n\nI found the limit of the 19.8-degree approach angle on my drive and returned with part of the XRT-exclusive front fascia tworked just a bit. There isn\u2019t any special underbody protection for the battery in the XRT, but the departure angle is a healthy 30 degrees and the car comes equipped with two front tow hooks.\n\nWhere the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 shines\n\nImage Credits:Hyundai\n\nOn the pavement, the Ioniq 5 is just as enjoyable as it ever was, with zippy acceleration, well-balanced handling, and a comfortable ride.\n\nPart of my first drive took me to higher elevations where the all-season tires were put to the slushy snow test. The car never lost grip, inspiring confidence in this desert dweller.\n\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 starts at $43,975, including the destination fee for a base SE model in rear-wheel drive with the standard battery. The off-roady XRT can be had for $56,875 while a top Limited trim in all-wheel drive will set you back $59,575.\n\nYou can get a Ford Mustang Mach-E at a lower starting price and comparable range, and all Mach-E cars are standard equipped with the hands-free/eyes-up BlueCruise highway driving assist. You\u2019ll pay a subscription fee to use the technology, but Hyundai doesn\u2019t offer anything like it.\n\nIf you\u2019re into futuristic looks, the Kia EV6 is a worthy competitor, especially if you\u2019re looking for performance. The GT AWD trim nets 576 ponies and 545 pound-feet of torque. Yowza.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to find fault with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. This refreshed Ioniq 5 maintains its pavement poise and adds a bit of adventure thrills with the new XRT trim. But owners may find themselves avoiding Tesla Superchargers despite that integrated NACS port.",

                "text": "Palantir co-founder and CEO Alexander Karp opens his new book with a provocative declaration: \u201cSilicon Valley has lost its way.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade or so, as the data analytics company rose to prominence with its work for U.S. military and intelligence, Karp has largely stayed out of the limelight. Last year, in a rare interview with The New York Times, he described himself as \u201cprogressive but not woke,\u201d with \u201ca consistently pro-Western view.\u201d\n\nNow, in \u201cThe Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the Future of the West\u201d (co-authored with Nicholas Zamiska, Palantir\u2019s head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the CEO), Karp has written something of a manifesto. In fact, he and Zamiska describe it as \u201cthe beginnings of the articulation of the theory\u201d behind Palantir.\n\nIn their telling, Silicon Valley\u2019s early success was created by a close alliance between technology companies and the U.S. government. They argue that this alliance has splintered, with the government \u201cceding the challenge of developing the next wave of pathbreaking technologies to the private sector,\u201d while Silicon Valley has \u201cturned inward, focusing its energy on narrow consumer products, rather than projects that speak to and address our greater security and welfare.\u201d\n\nThe pair criticize Silicon Valley\u2019s output as dominated by \u201conline advertising and shopping, as well as social media and video-sharing platforms,\u201d suggesting that this is the result of an industry that valorizes building things without asking what\u2019s worth building or why.\n\n\u201cThe central argument that we advance in the pages that follow is that the software industry should rebuild its relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face,\u201d Karp and Zamiska write.\n\nThey also argue that Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cengineering elite\u201d has \u201can affirmative obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the articulation of a national project \u2014 what is this country, what are our values, and for what do we stand.\u201d\n\nReviewers have not been entirely won over. In Bloomberg, John Ganz complained that \u201cThe Technological Republic\u201d is \u201cnot a book at all, but a piece of corporate sales material.\u201d\n\nAnd in The New Yorker, Gideon Lewis-Kraus suggested that the book is an \u201canachronism,\u201d presumably written before Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the November 2024 election. Now, Lewis-Kraus wrote, \u201cits vision of a mutually supportive relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley has in the interim been rendered almost quaint.\u201d\n\nIndeed, one thing that Karp and Zamiska criticize is \u201cthe reluctance of many business leaders to venture into, in any meaningful way and aside from the occasional and theatrical foray, the most consequential social and cultural debates of our time.\u201d\n\nOf course, we are now seeing at least one business leader take this directive to get involved in politics quite seriously, as Trump ally Elon Musk attempts to remake the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency.",

                "text": "Apple on Friday released its first developer beta for iOS 18.4, which adds a new \u201cPriority Notifications\u201d feature, powered by Apple Intelligence. The addition aims to help users manage their notifications by prioritizing important alerts and minimizing distractions from less important ones.\n\nThese priority notifications are displayed in a separate section on the phone\u2019s Lock Screen. Apple Intelligence will analyze which notifications it believes should be shown in this section, but you can still swipe up to view all of your notifications.\n\nCurrently, the iPhone will sort notifications chronologically, with the most recent alerts displayed on top. With the new feature, you\u2019ll see important notifications first \u2014 even if you received them a while ago when compared to others.\n\nAccording to 9to5Mac, Priority Notifications is off by default, but you can enable the feature by heading to your Settings app, selecting the \u201cNotifications\u201d option, and then opening the \u201cPrioritize Notifications\u201d section. Here, you can toggle the feature on.\n\nApple announced today that Apple Intelligence is heading to the Vision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers, while the public version is set for an April release. The tech giant also revealed Apple News+ Food, an upcoming section that will allow users to search and save recipes from dozens of existing News+ publishing partners.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said the market got it wrong when it comes to DeepSeek\u2019s technological advancements and its potential to negatively impact the chipmaker\u2019s business.\n\nInstead, Huang called DeepSeek\u2019s R1 open source reasoning model \u201cincredibly exciting\u201d while speaking with Alex Bouzari, CEO of DataDirect Networks, in a pre-recorded interview that was released on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think the market responded to R1, as in, \u2018Oh my gosh. AI is finished,\u2019\u201d Huang told Bouzari. \u201cYou know, it dropped out of the sky. We don\u2019t need to do any computing anymore. It\u2019s exactly the opposite. It\u2019s [the] complete opposite.\u201d\n\nHuang said that the release of R1 is inherently good for the AI market and will accelerate the adoption of AI as opposed to this release meaning that the market no longer had a use for compute resources \u2014 like the ones Nvidia produces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making everybody take notice that, okay, there are opportunities to have the models be far more efficient than what we thought was possible,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s expanding, and it\u2019s accelerating the adoption of AI.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that, despite the advancements DeepSeek made in pre-training AI models, post-training will remain important and resource-intensive.\n\n\u201cReasoning is a fairly compute-intensive part of it,\u201d Huang added.\n\nNvidia declined to provide further commentary.\n\nHuang\u2019s comments come almost a month after DeepSeek released the open source version of its R1 model, which rocked the AI market in general and seemed to disproportionately affect Nvidia. The company\u2019s stock price plummeted 16.9% in one market day upon the release of DeepSeek\u2019s news.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock closed at $142.62 a share on January 24, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The following Monday, January 27, the stock dropped rapidly and closed at $118.52 a share. This event wiped $600 billion off of Nvidia\u2019s market cap in just three days.\n\nThe chip company\u2019s stock has almost fully recovered since then. On Friday the stock opened at $140 a share, which means the company has been able to almost fully regain that lost value in about a month. Nvidia reports its Q4 earnings on February 26, which will likely address the market reaction more.\n\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek announced on Thursday that it plans to open source five code repositories as part of an \u201copen source week\u201d event next week.",

                "text": "Humane, formerly one of Silicon Valley\u2019s buzziest AI hardware startups, announced on Tuesday it was being partially acquired by HP for $116 million, which is less than half of the $240 million the startup raised in venture capital funding.\n\nTuesday may not have been a great day for some Humane investors, but it was especially chaotic for its roughly 200 employees, according to internal documents seen by TechCrunch and two sources who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.\n\nHours after the acquisition was announced, several Humane employees received job offers from HP with pay increases between 30% and 70%, plus HP stock and bonus plans, the sources revealed. Multiple employees who received offers worked on the company\u2019s core software, though sources also indicated that not all of the people who worked on software got job offers.\n\nMeanwhile, other Humane employees \u2014 especially those who worked closer to the Ai Pin devices, including in quality assurance, automation, and operations \u2014 were notified they were out of a job on Tuesday night, the sources said.\n\nThese job offers highlight HP\u2019s interest in obtaining Humane\u2019s pool of AI-focused software engineers as part of the acquisition. Engineers who can build around AI systems are some of the hottest commodities in Silicon Valley today. While Humane\u2019s team wasn\u2019t training AI foundation models from scratch \u2014 as do engineers at OpenAI, Google, and other AI labs \u2014 such employees are still highly sought after. This makes it difficult even for giant legacy players, such as HP, to hire.\n\nThe companies announced on Tuesday that a newly formed innovation lab at HP \u2014 HP IQ \u2014 will not only be home to Humane\u2019s co-founders, Imran Chaudhri and CEO Bethany Bongiorno, but also the startup\u2019s AI operating system, CosmOS. The new unit will focus on integrating artificial intelligence into HP\u2019s personal computers, printers, and connected conference rooms.\n\nSocial media users were quick to poke fun at Humane\u2019s employees, some of whom are leaving their buzzy startup jobs for stable roles building AI-enabled HP printers. However, one source said that these job offers, with their higher salaries, were exciting for many who received them.\n\nImpromptu, company-wide meetings\n\nHP\u2019s acquisition wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise to Humane employees. The New York Times reported in June that Humane wanted to sell itself to HP for more than $1 billion, though the final price ended up being far less.\n\nHumane\u2019s leadership also told some employees to prepare for \u201cbig news\u201d to come in late January, one person said.\n\nBut the news didn\u2019t come until the second half of February. When it did, Humane\u2019s employees weren\u2019t given much of a heads-up that a final agreement had been struck or that the Ai Pin business would be wound down.\n\nAround noon Pacific time on Tuesday, Humane\u2019s chief of staff, Andie Adragna, sent employees a Google Meet invite to an impromptu, company-wide meeting that was to occur in just a couple hours, according to internal correspondence seen by TechCrunch. The meeting took place at the company\u2019s San Francisco office and was livestreamed for remote employees.\n\nAt the meeting, Bongiorno told employees about the acquisition offer just moments before Humane and HP\u2019s press release went live, a source described.\n\nDuring another company-wide meeting later that day, Bongiorno clarified that some employees would get job offers to work at HP IQ, and others would not.\n\nMultiple Humane employees were then laid off via email on Tuesday and had their access to company systems cut off immediately, another source said.\n\nThe total number of Humane employees affected by the layoffs is unclear. HP and Humane did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAn early, troubled AI hardware startup\n\nImage Credits:Humane\n\nHumane\u2019s business showed signs of floundering for a while.\n\nThe Ai Pin was immediately met with negative reviews from early testers \u2014 a morale killer for the company\u2019s employees. Later, the product\u2019s charging case was briefly deemed a fire hazard. To make matters worse, the company\u2019s head of product engineering abandoned the startup in July to start his own company with some other Humane execs.\n\nThen things got really bad. Returns for the Ai Pin outpaced its sales at one point, which may have prompted the company to drop the price of its Ai Pins from $699 to $499.\n\nAfter the acquisition was announced, Humane told customers they should \u201crecycle\u201d their $499 Ai Pins, which the startup says will mostly stop working in less than two weeks.\n\nThat said, some employees view Humane as a moderate success story for a startup.\n\nMost startups do not sell thousands of devices, gain national attention, and get acquired for millions. Startup employees join these companies understanding the risk that their company will likely fail, but try anyway. In Humane\u2019s case, at least some portion of the staff is being offered a well-paying job at HP and will get to continue some projects they started at Humane.\n\nInterestingly, the Ai Pin, with its mission to replace a smartphone, has died right as other AI wearables seem to be picking up steam.\n\nMeta\u2019s Ray-Ban AI smart glasses continue to sell well, and the company is reportedly readying new versions for release later this year. Rabbit\u2019s R1 landed in Best Buy stores this week, opening the door to more mainstream electronics consumers. And we\u2019re still awaiting the release of Friend, another AI startup creating a wearable device to address loneliness.\n\nPerhaps most ironically, Apple released a $599 version of iPhone this week that\u2019s packed with AI features, mimicking features of the devices that hoped to replace phones.\n\nThe Ai Pin was almost definitely ahead of its time \u2014 the question now is, how early?",

The positions are split between software or machine learning engineer jobs, and roles focused on designing chips for Meta\u2019s data centers.\n\nMeta Bengaluru is looking for an \u201cexperienced Engineering Director to build and lead our engineering team in India,\u201d one of Meta\u2019s job ads, which was posted three weeks ago on LinkedIn, reads.\n\nThe engineering director in Bengaluru will be responsible for designing a strategy to hire and build founding engineering teams, plus help create \u201ca vision for engineer teams in India,\u201d the job ad states.\n\nThe new center is part of Meta\u2019s Enterprise Engineering team, according to a Meta employee\u2019s LinkedIn post. That team focuses on custom internal Meta tools, rather than on Meta\u2019s best-known products like Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWhile Meta has several existing offices in India, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, New Delhi, and Mumbai, most have fewer job openings and they\u2019re mainly for non-engineering roles. Only 1 of the 12 available positions at the other locations is engineering-related, Meta\u2019s careers page shows.\n\nA Meta spokesperson in India told TechCrunch that it is recruiting for a \u201csmall number of engineering positions in Bengaluru.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe regularly update our location strategies to support our long-term investments,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe 41 positions in Bangalore are a small proportion of Meta\u2019s global job postings, which currently total over 1,700. But it represents a shift for Meta, which has not traditionally used India as an engineering hub \u2014 those positions have historically been based in North America and Europe.\n\nIn one example from 2022, an Indian software engineer made headlines after he was laid off by Meta just two days after relocating to Canada for the job.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta intends to backfill the jobs it cut during its most recent round of layoffs.",

Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, and Balwani received nearly 13 years. Both began serving their sentences in 2023.\n\nIn their appeal, the two argued that the district court allowed improper testimony from former Theranos employees who served as lay witnesses but wound up offering improper expert testimony without the necessary legal designation. The appeals panel agreed that some testimony crossed into expert territory but concluded the errors were harmless.\n\nHolmes also contested the inclusion of a damning government report that highlighted failures in Theranos\u2019 lab, arguing it unfairly influenced the jury. But the court found the report relevant in establishing her knowledge and intent. Holmes argued that her rights were violated when she was prohibited from cross-examining a former Theranos laboratory director regarding aspects of his post-Theranos employment. Again, the appellate panel disagreed, saying the court didn\u2019t \u201cabuse its discretion in limiting the scope of the cross-examination.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Balwani claimed his charges were improperly expanded during the trial (the panel dismissed this argument pretty forcefully). He also argued that his right to a fair trial was violated because the government didn\u2019t correct what he said was false testimony from two investors. The court rejected that argument, too, saying even if there were issues, they wouldn\u2019t have affected the outcome of the case.\n\nBalwani is serving his sentence at the grimly named Terminal Island, a minimum-security federal facility just outside Los Angeles; Holmes is serving hers at FPC Bryan, a minimum-security federal prison camp that\u2019s approximately 100 miles from Houston.",

                "text": "Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, the executive in charge of leading the App Store, testified in court on Monday that he had originally raised concerns about the 27% commission the iPhone maker planned to charge app developers on any purchases made outside the App Store. In addition to being a potential compliance risk, he suggested that the fee would create an \u201cantagonistic relationship\u201d between Apple and developers and seemed to require Apple to have audit rights to check whether or not they owed Apple money for the transactions that took place outside the App Store.\n\nApple typically charges a 30% commission on in-app purchases, but the reduced fee of 27% was a result of the Epic Games-Apple ruling. In 2021, the court determined that although the tech giant was not a monopolist, it would have to stop blocking app developers from linking to other ways for customers to pay beyond Apple\u2019s own in-app purchases (IAP).\n\nApple technically complied with the ruling by changing its App Store Guidelines to permit developers to link to their websites from their iOS and iPadOS apps to give customers an alternative way to pay.\n\nHowever, Apple only reduced its commission by 3% for these purchases.\n\nAt the time, Fortnite maker Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple for \u201cbad-faith\u201d compliance, saying the tech company undermined the 2021 order from U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, which had granted developers the right to add buttons or links to other purchasing mechanisms in addition to Apple\u2019s IAP.\n\nApple and Epic Games have since returned to federal court so Rogers could determine whether Apple violated her original order that forced the App Store to open to more competition.\n\nAccording to Schiller\u2019s testimony, he initially objected to commissions on these outside purchases.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I had great concerns about the collections of funds from developers,\u201d he said, specifically \u201cthe change in the role of the App Store to now an organization that needs to collect money from developers.\u201d\n\nHe said he was worried about how the App Store would have to go after developers who didn\u2019t pay the commissions, making it \u201csome kind of a collection agency\u201d that had \u201crules around how we handle nonpayment and whether ultimately it means we\u2019re going to have to do audits of developers.\u201d\n\nSchiller said he worried about \u201chow all of those things change the relationship between Apple and developers in a way I thought would be detrimental.\u201d\n\nThe hearing has unearthed the extensive process Apple underwent while debating the merits of still charging a fee. With hosts of documents and emails, lawyers detailed the back-and-forth that took place internally at Apple as executives weighed different options regarding its compliance with the court\u2019s order.\n\nDespite the initial concerns Schiller raised, a pricing committee that included Apple CEO Tim Cook, former CFO Luca Maestri, and Apple\u2019s legal team, alongside Schiller, ultimately decided to charge developers a commission on these outside purchases.\n\nThe company also decided the same 3% fee reduction would apply to developers in its Small Business Program, lowering their already reduced commission of 15% to 12% for transactions outside the App Store.\n\nDocuments referenced in court indicated that Apple analyzed the financial impact on developers who chose to link out to their own websites.\n\nIn one model, for example, Apple worked to determine how the \u201cless seamless experience\u201d of using a non-IAP method would lead customers to abandon their transactions. By modeling where this tipping point was, Apple was able to determine when the links would stop being an advantage to developers, which would push them back to using IAP.\n\nApple also found that more restrictive rules around the placement and formatting of the links themselves could reduce the number of apps that decided to implement these outside links. The company looked into the financial impact of excluding some other partners \u2014 like those in its video and news programs \u2014 from the new program.\n\nThe company weighed different options for when to charge commissions, too. At one time, it thought to charge its 27% fee on external purchases that took place within 72 hours of when the link was clicked. When the new guidelines went live, however, that time frame had been stretched to seven days.\n\nLawyers suggested Cook himself was involved with how the warning to App Store customers would appear, recommending an update to the text that appears when the external links were clicked. In one version, that link warned customers they were \u201cno longer transacting with Apple.\u201d Later, the link was updated to subtly suggest there could be privacy or security risks with purchases made on the web.\n\nIn another meeting about the commissions, people had also expressed concerns about Apple charging for web transactions.\n\n\u201cThis might be perceived like we\u2019re trying to charge for what happens on the internet,\u201d one of the notes from the meeting said.",

Yes, really.\n\nIn a blog post published Monday, Anthropic said that it tested its latest model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, on the Game Boy classic Pok\u00e9mon Red. The company equipped the model with basic memory, screen pixel input, and function calls to press buttons and navigate around the screen, allowing it to play Pok\u00e9mon continuously.\n\nA unique feature of Claude 3.7 Sonnet is its ability to engage in \u201cextended thinking.\u201d Like OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini and DeepSeek\u2019s R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can \u201creason\u201d through challenging problems by applying more computing \u2014 and taking more time.\n\nThat came in handy in Pok\u00e9mon Red, apparently.\n\nCompared to a previous version of Claude, Claude 3.0 Sonnet, which failed to leave the house in Pallet Town where the story begins, Claude 3.7 Sonnet successfully battled three Pok\u00e9mon gym leaders and won their badges.\n\nImage Credits:Anthropic\n\nNow, it\u2019s not clear how much computing was required for Claude 3.7 Sonnet to reach those milestones \u2014 and how long each took. Anthropic only said that the model performed 35,000 actions to reach the last gym leader, Surge.\n\nIt surely won\u2019t be long before some enterprising developer finds out.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Red is more of a toy benchmark than anything. However, there is a long history of games being used for AI benchmarking purposes. In the past few months alone, a number of new apps and platforms have cropped up to test models\u2019 game-playing abilities on titles ranging from Street Fighter to Pictionary.",

Artists can also choose to manually add links to other ticketing platforms.\n\nThe platform said that it will promote these events through a concert discovery widget on the SoundCloud home page, which will be powered by Ticketmaster data. Users can sort through these events by city, time, and genre. SoundCloud takes a cut from any affiliate ticket sales made through Ticketmaster links on its platform.\n\nBefore this, the audio streaming service had an integration with the music community platform Resident Advisor for three of the artists\u2019 latest events. However, there were no customization features.\n\nEvent display and ticket selling are becoming an important area of growth for music streaming platforms. In 2022, Spotify started testing direct ticket sales from its app. The company is also exploring a $6 per month subscription for super fans, which will give them early access to concert tickets, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe story has been updated to reflect SoundCloud takes an unspecified cut from Ticketmaster.",

Google says the new update is designed to make it easier for users to find specific moments in a video by searching the transcript. Plus, it makes it easier for users to follow along with the content of a video.\n\nTo access video transcripts, you need to open a video with captions in Google Drive and click the gear icon in the bottom right corner of the video to open the video settings. Then, you just need to select the \u201cTranscript\u201d option.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that your video must have captions if you want to see a transcript. You can tell if your video has captions if the \u201cCC\u201d button in the bottom-right corner of the video player is set to active.\n\nYou can add captions to a video by right-clicking it and then selecting the \u201cManage caption tracks.\u201d From there, you can select the \u201cgenerate automatic captions\u201d button.\n\nThe new feature is rolling out over the coming weeks to all Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and users with personal Google accounts.",

Users can choose whether to activate the AI model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d abilities, which prompt Claude 3.7 Sonnet to \u201cthink\u201d for a short or long period of time.\n\nThe model represents Anthropic\u2019s broader effort to simplify the user experience around its AI products. Most AI chatbots today have a daunting model picker that forces users to choose from several different options that vary in cost and capability. Labs like Anthropic would rather you not have to think about it \u2014 ideally, one model does all the work.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is rolling out to all users and developers on Monday, Anthropic said, but only people who pay for Anthropic\u2019s premium Claude chatbot plans will get access to the model\u2019s reasoning features. Free Claude users will get the standard, non-reasoning version of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which Anthropic claims outperforms its previous frontier AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. (Yes, the company skipped a number.)\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet costs $3 per million input tokens (meaning you could enter roughly 750,000 words, more words than the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series, into Claude for $3) and $15 per million output tokens. That makes it more expensive than OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini ($1.10 per 1 million input tokens/$4.40 per 1 million output tokens) and DeepSeek\u2019s R1 (55 cents per 1 million input tokens/$2.19 per 1 million output tokens), but keep in mind that o3-mini and R1 are strictly reasoning models \u2014 not hybrids like Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s new thinking modes Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic\u2019s first AI model that can \u201creason,\u201d a technique many AI labs have turned to as traditional methods of improving AI performance taper off.\n\nReasoning models like o3-mini, R1, Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and xAI\u2019s Grok 3 (Think) use more time and computing power before answering questions. The models break problems down into smaller steps, which tends to improve the accuracy of the final answer. Reasoning models aren\u2019t thinking or reasoning like a human would, necessarily, but their process is modeled after deduction.\n\nEventually, Anthropic would like Claude to figure out how long it should \u201cthink\u201d about questions on its own, without needing users to select controls in advance, Anthropic\u2019s product and research lead, Dianne Penn, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\n\u201cSimilar to how humans don\u2019t have two separate brains for questions that can be answered immediately versus those that require thought,\u201d Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch, \u201cwe regard reasoning as simply one of the capabilities a frontier model should have, to be smoothly integrated with other capabilities, rather than something to be provided in a separate model.\u201d\n\nAnthropic says it\u2019s allowing Claude 3.7 Sonnet to show its internal planning phase through a \u201cvisible scratch pad.\u201d Penn told TechCrunch users will see Claude\u2019s full thinking process for most prompts, but that some portions may be redacted for trust and safety purposes.\n\nClaude\u2019s thinking process in the claude app Image Credits:Anthropic\n\nAnthropic says it optimized Claude\u2019s thinking modes for real-world tasks, such as difficult coding problems or agentic tasks. Developers tapping Anthropic\u2019s API can control the \u201cbudget\u201d for thinking, trading speed, and cost for quality of answer.\n\nOn one test to measure real-word coding tasks, SWE-Bench, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was 62.3% accurate, compared to OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini model which scored 49.3%. On another test to measure an AI model\u2019s ability to interact with simulated users and external APIs in a retail setting, TAU-Bench, Claude 3.7 Sonnet scored 81.2%, compared to OpenAI\u2019s o1 model which scored 73.5%.\n\nAnthropic also says Claude 3.7 Sonnet will refuse to answer questions less often than its previous models, claiming the model is capable of making more nuanced distinctions between harmful and benign prompts. Anthropic says it reduced unnecessary refusals by 45% compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This comes at a time when some other AI labs are rethinking their approach to restricting their AI chatbot\u2019s answers.\n\nIn addition to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic is also releasing an agentic coding tool called Claude Code. Launching as a research preview, the tool lets developers run specific tasks through Claude directly from their terminal.\n\nIn a demo, Anthropic employees showed how Claude Code can analyze a coding project with a simple command such as, \u201cExplain this project structure.\u201d Using plain English in the command line, a developer can modify a codebase. Claude Code will describe its edits as it makes changes, and even test a project for errors or push it to a GitHub repository.\n\nClaude Code will initially be available to a limited number of users on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis, an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nAnthropic is releasing Claude 3.7 Sonnet at a time when AI labs are shipping new AI models at a breakneck pace. Anthropic has historically taken a more methodical, safety-focused approach. But this time, the company\u2019s looking to lead the pack.\n\nFor how long, though, is the question. OpenAI may be close to releasing a hybrid AI model of its own; the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, has said it\u2019ll arrive in \u201cmonths.\u201d",

                "text": "The CEO of Clearview AI, the controversial facial recognition startup that created a searchable database of 30 billion photos by scraping the internet, has resigned, according to a statement he supplied to TechCrunch.\n\nThe CEO, Hoan Ton-That, said \u201cit is time for the next chapter in my life\u201d and that he would remain on as a board member of Clearview AI. He declined to comment when asked for more details on what specifically sparked his resignation. The news was first reported by Forbes.\n\nClearview AI now has two \u201cco-CEOs,\u201d early investor Hal Lambert and co-founder Richard Schwartz, who want to capitalize on new \u201copportunities\u201d under the Trump administration, according to a statement Clearview AI sent to TechCrunch.\n\nBoth men have a long history in Republican politics. Lambert\u2019s investment firm, Point Bridge Capital, is best-known for launching the MAGA ETF in 2017, which invests in corporations supportive of Republican candidates. Meanwhile, Schwartz served as a senior advisor to Rudy Giuliani during his tenure as mayor of New York City.\n\nClearview AI sells access to its facial recognition database to law enforcement and federal agencies who use it to identify suspects or find missing people. Because the startup obtained the photos without people\u2019s consent, it has had to fend off multiple privacy suits and fines.\n\nAs of September 2024, Clearview AI has racked up over $100 million in GDPR fines from European data protection agencies in the Netherlands, France, and elsewhere. Clearview AI has historically remained uncooperative, refusing to pay these fines. (Clearview didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch asking if it has paid any yet.)\n\nClearview AI has also faced a lawsuit from conservative investor and self-described investigative journalist Charles Johnson over claims that he was a co-founder and owed a share of commissions. Johnson recently dropped the suit, per a legal filing. But Clearview AI\u2019s counterclaims in the suit, which allege defamation and breach of contract against Johnson, are ongoing, Biometric Update reported.\n\nTon-That declined to elaborate on his plans when asked by TechCrunch. According to his statement, Clearview AI is in its \u201cstrongest position ever\u201d financially, achieving its highest growth and revenue in 2024. However, the startup has struggled to win large federal contracts and remains unprofitable, Forbes reported.\n\nClearview AI, whose investors include Peter Thiel and Naval Ravikant, raised $30 million in a Series B round in 2021 that valued the company at $130 million, according to a post on its website.",

                "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Arize-founders.png?w=700",
                "text": "There are numerous observability platforms that monitor and evaluate cloud software, like Dynatrace and ServiceNow, which flag potential code errors or failures so engineers can find and fix them. Arize AI says it is bringing that same approach to AI models and applications.\n\nArize is an AI observability platform that helps companies evaluate their AI products as they are building them and then monitor those products for errors and issues once they are up and running. Arize\u2019s platform works with a variety of AI applications, from machine learning and computer vision to generative AI.\n\nJason Lopatecki, Arize co-founder and CEO (pictured above, left), told TechCrunch that Arize uses a \u201ccouncil of judges\u201d approach to monitor and evaluate AI. This approach includes evaluating AI with different AI models \u2014 which Lopatecki joked is, yes, very meta \u2014 in addition to having humans in the loop.\n\nThe idea behind Arize came from Lopatecki\u2019s previous company, TubeMogul, a brand advertising company, which was acquired by Adobe for over $500 million in 2016.\n\nEverything at TubeMogul ran on AI, Lopatecki said, and when it would break it would be a \u201cbig deal\u201d since the technology was so complicated. Aparna Dhinakaran, a co-founder and CPO at Arize (pictured above, right), who met Lopatecki through TubeMogul, had run into similar issues developing language models without having the proper tools to test and evaluate as she built.\n\n\u201cWe both saw the problem space and really had that idea that AI is going to be high stakes in more and more organizations everywhere,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, it\u2019s really hard to tell what it\u2019s doing, when it\u2019s broken and how to fix it.\u201d\n\nThe pair launched Arize in 2020 with an initial focus on the AI trend of the day: predictive machine learning. Lopatecki said that when Arize got started, it was really just an idea. Today, five years later, the market gets the problem and Arize\u2019s platform works with everything from AI agents to generative AI.\n\n\u201cSo the last two years have been, I would say, explosive, explosive in growth,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cSimply because [AI] is more accessible. Everyone\u2019s a prompt engineer. Every engineer is a prompt engineer. Everyone is integrating [AI] products into their product lines.\u201d\n\nArize now works with enterprises including Uber, Klaviyo, and Tripadvisor, among others. The company also has an open source offering, Arize Phoenix, which has more than two million monthly downloads.\n\nThe Berkeley, California-based company recently raised a $70 million Series C round led by Adams Street Partners with participation from M12, SineWave Ventures, and OMERS Ventures, among other investors, in addition to strategic backers including Datadog and PagerDuty. This brings the company\u2019s total funding to more than $130 million to date.\n\nThe company plans to put its latest round of funding toward improving its main product and doubling down on growing AI segments, including voice and AI agents. Dhinakaran joked that while their open source product may be their biggest competitor, the company plans to put more money into developing that product, too.\n\n\u201cOur open source Phoenix has just been growing, it\u2019s been growing massively, and so I think we love that. We love open source,\u201d Dhinakaran said.\n\nThe AI observability and evaluation space is becoming increasingly crowded. Dhinakaran said that they think that Arize offers both pre- and post-launch evaluations, and can be used across a variety of different AI applications, which helps the company stand out; although, there are companies with very similar offerings, like Galileo, which has raised $68 million in venture funding, and Patronus AI, which has raised $20 million in funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to build the [infrastructure] to do this, right?\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of why I think the Microsofts and Datadogs are investing in us, or making a bet on us. I think people also now see how big this market can be. You\u2019re going to have a lot of little guys. You\u2019re gonna have big people jumping in it, and I expect it to be a fast, growing, large market.\u201d\n\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect when Arize was founded.",

                "text": "Codeium, an AI-powered coding startup, is raising a new round of funding at a $2.85 billion valuation, including fresh capital, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal.\n\nThe round is being led by returning investor Kleiner Perkins, the people said.\n\nThe new round comes just six months after Silicon Valley-based Codeium announced that it had closed a $150 million Series C at a $1.25 billion post-money valuation led by General Catalyst with participation of Kleiner Perkins and Greenoaks. TechCrunch could not confirm the dollar amount of the new funding.\n\nCodeium and Kleiner Perkins didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), one person said. Based on that revenue figure, Codeium\u2019s implied valuation is roughly 70 times ARR. That\u2019s a lot higher than other AI code editing companies.\n\nLast month, Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, announced a new funding round of financing at a $2.5 billion valuation. Based on its reported $100 million in revenue, investors assigned it a 25 times ARR valuation multiple.\n\nIn addition to Anysphere, which many investors say is the current leader in the category, Codeium competes with Poolside, Magic, Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, and many others.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear how Codeuim negotiated such a rich valuation, sources told TechCrunch that the company wasn\u2019t looking to raise new funds before investors approached it about this round.\n\nCodeium tries to distinguish itself from competitors by targeting companies rather than individual developers. Last summer, the company told TechCrunch that the free tier of its platform was being used by over 1,000 enterprise customers, including Anduril, Zillow, and Dell.\n\nIn November, the company introduced Windsurf Editor, which can write some of the code without human involvement, an approach that\u2019s known as agentic AI, or \u201cagent mode.\u201d Others, such as Cursor, also offer a similar feature.\n\nCodeium was founded in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen. Prior to Codeium, Chen was at Meta, where he helped build software tools for VR headsets like the Oculus Quest. Mohan was a tech lead at Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, responsible for managing the autonomy infrastructure team.",

                "text": "Austin-based defense startup Saronic has raised a $600 million Series C to build an autonomous ship factory called \u201cPort Alpha,\u201d it announced yesterday, quadrupling its valuation to $4 billion from its last round.\n\nInvestor Elad Gil led the round, with General Catalyst joining existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, 8VC, and Caffeinated Capital, among others.\n\nThat should make Saronic the second, possibly third, most valuable defense tech startup in the U.S. after Anduril\u2019s last round valued it at $14 billion. Shield AI could beat that, though, as it is reportedly in talks to hit a $5 billion valuation on a new round of funding. (Anduril is in talks to raise again at double its valuation, to $28 billion.)\n\nSaronic isn\u2019t the only defense tech darling with big manufacturing ambitions: Anduril, for example, announced plans to build a billion-dollar megafactory in Ohio last month.\n\nSaronic hasn\u2019t found a site for Port Alpha yet but is actively searching, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Operations at the port, which Saronic is calling the \u201cshipyard of the future,\u201d are slated to begin within five years, Saronic\u2019s co-founder and CEO Dino Mavrookas told Defense News.\n\nSaronic has already developed three models of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) that are up to 24 feet long \u2014 about half as long as a modern lifeboat. But Saronic says the factory will also build large unmanned ships, while bolstering U.S. shipbuilding capacity compared to China.\n\nUnmanned ships are a hot trend in naval warfare, in part thanks to Ukraine\u2019s successful use of drone ships to drive the Russian Navy out of Crimea, despite Ukraine having effectively no manned navy of its own.\n\nSaronic has now raised almost $850 million, Mavrookas said on CNBC, attributing the quadrupled valuation to Saronic\u2019s speed at developing new vessels and software.\n\nSaronic\u2019s raise is the latest sign that defense tech continues to hit new highs in Silicon Valley, buoyed by similar monster rounds.",

                "text": "For decades, couples going through in vitro fertilization have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on the procedures with no guarantee of success.\n\nIt\u2019s not only an emotionally draining process, but a financially exhausting one as well.\n\nSan Francisco-based startup Future Family wants to help ease some of that burden for couples with a new IVF insurance product in the United States. Built with the support of Munich Re Ventures \u2014 the venture arm of global reinsurer Munich Re \u2014 the new offering essentially offers a money-back guarantee to those going through IVF.\n\nCEO and co-founder Claire Tomkins likens it to trip insurance. A couple pays 20% insurance upfront before starting an IVF cycle. If they don\u2019t have a baby after two cycles or lose the baby within two weeks of birth, they can file a claim to be reimbursed.\n\nThe cost of two IVF cycles can reach $40,000, depending on location. With Orange Shield, Future Family\u2019s new product, the average cost of protection is $3,000 down and $999/month for five months. If treatment doesn\u2019t succeed after two rounds, families can get a refund under their IVF insurance policy.\n\nOrange Shield is available at participating clinics nationwide. Families can pay either via monthly installments or with lump sum payments. Overall, the policy covers all IVF-related expenses up to the selected coverage limit, with a maximum of $50,000. All eligible treatment costs can be included.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: to help build more families by making IVF successful, easy to afford, and less stressful,\u201d said Tomkins, herself a mother to three children born through IVF. \u201cIVF insurance works like other types of insurance \u2014 similar to auto insurance, where you purchase coverage hoping you won\u2019t need to file a claim.\u201d\n\nEligibility criteria is based on a range of underwriting factors, including age and medical history, she said. And patients aged 38 years or older who plan to use their own eggs are not currently eligible for coverage. However, patients 38 and older can qualify for coverage if using donor eggs. Other eligibility factors include lifestyle habits such as tobacco use, intended egg/sperm sources, and infertility history.\n\nSince its 2016 inception, Future Family says it has worked with over 10,000 families to help them navigate the IVF process with a variety of offerings, including fertility financing for IVF and egg freezing, and one-on-one coaching. It says it also has distributed $200 million in credit.\n\nIn total over the years, Future Family \u2014 a Startup Battlefield company \u2014 has secured $150 million in funding, including $100 million in a credit facility announced in 2018. Investors include Munich Re Ventures, TriVentures, MS&AD Ventures, ORIX, Aspect Ventures, Mindset Ventures, at.inc/, and OurCrowd. Its last raise was a $25 million Series B announced in April of 2022.\n\nIn vitro fertilization is an area long tackled by startups. More recently, a new fertility wellness company, Lushi, emerged with $5 million in funding.",

                "text": "The demand for voice and speech recognition technologies is massive \u2014 and growing. An analysis by market research firm Markets and Markets found that the sector could be worth over $28.1 billion by 2027.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of vendors providing voice and speech recognition solutions, but some newer upstarts have managed to carve out niches. Sanas is a good example. Founded in 2020, the company develops software that uses AI to adjust a speaker\u2019s accent in real time.\n\n\u201cAt Sanas, we believe that while technology is transforming the industry, it shouldn\u2019t replace human connection, but rather, enhance it,\u201d Sharath Keshava Narayana, Sanas\u2019 co-founder and president, told TechCrunch. \u201cWith the number of customer interactions continuing to scale globally, the need for human-to-human communication remains critical.\u201d\n\nMaxim Serebryakov launched Sanas with Shawn Zhang and Andr\u00e9s Soderi while in college. The trio was inspired by a fellow student\u2019s frustrating experience working in a call center.\n\n\u201cMax and Shawn\u2019s friend, Raul, who had to return to Nicaragua to support his family, faced accent discrimination at his call center job,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cHis experience with \u2018accent neutralization training\u2019 and the toll it took on him inspired Max and Shawn to build a solution to reduce accent bias.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Narayana, who previously co-founded call center startup Observe.ai, joined Sanas, and the company secured its first tranche of funding.\n\nSanas\u2019 technology analyzes speech and outputs converted speech that matches a specified accent. The company claims it is able to preserve the original speaker\u2019s emotion and \u201cidentity\u201d while minimizing reverb, echo, and noise.\n\n\u201cWhat sets Sanas apart is the company\u2019s patented AI technologies, which recognize phonetic patterns and adjust them instantly while keeping the speaker\u2019s unique identity intact,\u201d Narayana said. \u201cSanas\u2019s AI models are trained with over 50 million utterances of speech using datasets collected from our technology partners and in-house voice actors.\u201d\n\nRecently, Sanas acquired InTone, a competitor, which Narayana said \u201cstrengthens Sanas\u2019 IP portfolio\u201d and positions the startup to serve a wider customer base.\n\nToday, Sanas has around 50 customers in such industries as healthcare, logistics, and hardware manufacturing. Narayana said that the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue has reached $21 million, up $3 million from last year.\n\nSanas is in a bit of a controversial business. Some research suggests that exposure to different accents in fact helps to combat bias. As technologists told The Guardian in a 2022 profile of the startup, Sanas\u2019 solutions run the risk of homogenizing workers across call centers.\n\nNarayana pushed back against this notion.\n\n\u201cWhat makes Sanas special is not just the technology, but its deeply human mission to break barriers, reduce discrimination, and amplify voices across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with my co-founders, we\u2019re building a world where communication is a bridge \u2014 not a barrier.\u201d\n\nThe mixed optics don\u2019t appear to have impacted Sanas\u2019 ability to raise cash. This week, Sanas announced that it closed a $65 million funding round that values the company at over $500 million. Quadrille Capital and Teleperformance led the round, which also had participation from Insight Partners, Quiet Capital, Alorica, and DN Capital.\n\nHaving raised over $100 million in capital to date, Sanas plans to build new \u201cspeech-to-speech\u201d algorithms, expand to new regions, and \u201cexplore opportunities across industries such as healthcare, retail, and\n\nbeyond,\u201d Narayana said.\n\n\u201cWith a clear focus on scaling responsibly and innovating continuously, Sanas is well-prepared to weather potential headwinds,\u201d he continued.\n\nSanas also intends to grow its roughly 150-person team, Narayana added, and open a new office in the Philippines, a country home to millions of contact centers.",

Back in November 2023, OpenAI made a splash with its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Despite being initially restricted to iOS users in the U.S., it managed to attract 500,000 downloads in just six days. (According to Appfigures\u2019 latest metrics, ChatGPT has now been downloaded 350 million times.)\n\nBetween January 10 and January 31, AI player DeepSeek\u2019s mobile app also recorded one million downloads. But that was just the beginning, as the Chinese app went viral in late January \u2014 attracting millions of additional new users in just a few days.\n\nMistral is also facing competition from veteran Big Tech companies, too. The likes of Google and Microsoft also want to take part in the AI assistant race and capture a spot on your phone\u2019s home screen, starting with Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.",

                "text": "Apple Intelligence is heading to the Vision Pro as part of an upcoming operating system update. Apple confirmed on Friday that its generative AI platform will arrive on the extended reality headset as part of visionOS 2.4. A beta version of the software is currently available for developers. The public version is set for an April release.\n\nLike the iPhone and Mac before it, the Vision Pro will receive Apple Intelligence updates in waves. The first set includes several familiar offerings, focused primarily on generating text and images. The company sees the addition of features like Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize as key components for on-device workflow.\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Apple has framed Vision Pro as a \u201cspatial computing\u201d device since the outset. For all the video, gaming, and other entertainment features, the company has sought to set the system apart from its extended reality predecessors by positioning it as an extension of desktop computing \u2014 or, as TechCrunch framed it in our review, \u201cThe infinite desktop.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, composing text is a mixed bag on the headset. The default typing method requires the wearer to look at a letter, before pinching two fingers together to select. While well implemented, it\u2019s cumbersome when faced with writing more than a word or two at a time. Voice addresses this bottleneck to a degree, and Apple\u2019s recent AI-powered Siri supercharge bodes well for the smart assistant\u2019s Vision Pro future.\n\nApple is banking on the combination of voice dictation and generative AI writing tools to deliver a smoother experience to convince more Vision Pro users to incorporate the headset into more of their existing workflows. At the very least, features like Message Summaries and email Smart Reply streamline interaction with different apps, without taking the user away from a given task.\n\nImage Playground is the other big piece of the puzzle, bringing image generation to the wearable display as part of the visionOS 2.4 update. The feature is integrated directly into the visionOS Photos app, allowing users to create images through verbal prompts.\n\nAll of the above features have previously been rolled out on iOS, macOS, and iPadOS. There are no new Apple Intelligence features specific to Vision Pro arriving in this update.\n\nAlong with visionOS 2.4, Apple has also launched a Vision Pro iPhone app arriving with iOS 18.4, which is also now in beta. The app serves a few different purposes. Foremost is the ability to browse visionOS content, like TV shows and movies, which can then be transferred onto the headset. This feature appears to be, in part, a response to the limitations of wearing the headset, both in terms of personal comfort and battery life. If you\u2019re going to be scrolling through content, you might as well do it from the comfort of your iPhone.\n\nWhen an iPhone is unlocked and within proximity of the headset, the new app can also be used to manage guest accounts. The Vision Pro will prompt its owner when someone is attempting to sign in as a guest. A streaming image of the guest\u2019s in-headset view is accessible through the new app, as well.",

                "text": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\n\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\n\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a \u2018unified\u2019 next-gen release\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI\u2019s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model\u2019s thought process\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \u201cthought\u201d process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \u201cchain of thought\u201d that shows more of the model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot\u2019s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for \u2018deep research\u2019\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI \u201cagent\u201d called deep research that\u2019s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \u201cagent\u201d is intended for instances where you don\u2019t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nOpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user\u2019s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models\u2019 responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest \u2018reasoning\u2019 model\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI \u201creasoning\u201d model, o3-mini, the newest in the company\u2019s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are 85% male, report says\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\n\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\n\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like \u2018chatty\u2019 and \u2018Gen Z\u2019\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nDecember 2024\n\nChatGPT Search can be tricked into misleading users, new research reveals\n\nChatGPT Search can be fooled into generating completely misleading summaries, The Guardian has found. They found ChatGPT could be prompted to ignore negative reviews and generate \u201centirely positive\u201d summaries by inserting hidden text into websites it created and that ChatGPT Search could also be made to spit out malicious code using this method.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI reportedly have a finance-centric definition of AGI\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have a very specific, internal definition of AGI based on the startup\u2019s profits, according to a new report from The Information. The two companies reportedly signed an agreement stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profit, which is far from the rigorous technical and philosophical definition of AGI many would expect.\n\nOpenAI trained o1 and o3 to \u2018think\u2019 about its safety policy\n\nOpenAI released new research outlining the company\u2019s approach to ensure AI reasoning models stay aligned with the values of their human developers. The startup used \u201cdeliberative alignment\u201d to make o1 and o3 \u201cthink\u201d about OpenAI\u2019s safety policy. According to OpenAI\u2019s research, the method decreased the rate at which o1 answered \u201cunsafe\u201d questions while improving its ability to answer benign ones.\n\nOpenAI announces new o3 reasoning models\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the successors to its o1 reasoning model family: o3 and o3-mini. The models are not widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview. The reveal marks the end of the \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event, which saw announcements for real-time vision capabilities, ChatGPT Search, and even a Santa voice for ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline\n\nIn an effort to make ChatGPT accessible to as many people as possible, OpenAI announced a 1-800 number to call the chatbot \u2014 even from a landline or a flip phone. Users can call 1-800-CHATGPT, and ChatGPT will respond to your queries in an experience that is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode \u2014 minus the multimodality.\n\nOpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply.\n\nOpenAI brings its ChatGPT Search to more users\n\nOpenAI is bringing ChatGPT Search to free, logged in users. Search gives ChatGPT the ability to access real-time information on the web to better answer your queries, but was only available for paid users when it launched in October. Not only is Search available now for free users, but it\u2019s also been integrated into Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nOpenAI blames massive ChatGPT outage on a \u2018new telemetry service\u2019\n\nOpenAI is blaming one of the longest outages in its history on a \u201cnew telemetry service\u201d gone awry. OpenAI wrote in a postmortem that the outage wasn\u2019t caused by a security incident or recent product launch, but by a telemetry service it deployed to collect Kubernetes metrics.\n\nYou can make ChatGPT sound like Santa for a limited time\n\nOpenAI announced that ChatGPT users could access a new \u201cSanta Mode\u201d voice during December. The feature allows users to speak with ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, but with a Christmas twist. The voice sounds, well, \u201cmerry and bright,\u201d as OpenAI described it. Think boomy, jolly \u2014 more or less like every Santa you\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nOpenAI adds vision to Advanced Voice Mode\n\nOpenAI released the real-time video capabilities for ChatGPT that it demoed nearly seven months ago. ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what\u2019s on a device\u2019s screen through screen sharing.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\n\nChatGPT and Sora hit with a major outage\n\nChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbus denied it in a post on X, saying the \u201coutage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.\u201d\n\nChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we've recovered. https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 12, 2024\n\nCanvas rolls out to everyone\n\nCanvas, OpenAI\u2019s collaboration-focused interface for writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs.\n\nOpenAI pauses Sora sign-ups due to high demand\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. The company released Sora as part of its \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d event following nearly a year of teasing the product.\n\ndemand higher than expected; signups will be disabled on and off and generations will be slow for awhile.\n\n\n\ndoing our best! https://t.co/JU3WxE5bGl \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 9, 2024\n\nOpenAI has finally released its text to video model, Sora. The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be \u201cremixed\u201d through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers (except in the EU).\n\nIn Monday\u2019s \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d livestream, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get \u201cunlimited\u201d generations in their \u201cslow queue mode\u201d and 500 \u201cnormal\u201d generations per month.\n\nThere are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23.

The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbot hit 200 million weekly active users in August 2024 and just over a year after reaching 100 million weekly active users in November 2023.\n\nNovember 2024\n\nUsers discovered the name \u2018David Mayer\u2019 crashed ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questions asked about a \u201cDavid Mayer,\u201d and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it: digital privacy requests.\n\nAds might be headed to ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI is toying with the idea of getting into ads. CFO Sarah Friar told the Financial Times it\u2019s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d about when and where ads appear \u2014 though she later stressed that the company has \u201cno active plans to pursue advertising.\u201d Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently said ads would be a \u201clast resort.\u201d\n\nCanadian news companies sue OpenAI\n\nA group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI. The companies behind the suit said that OpenAI infringed their copyrights and are seeking to win monetary damages \u2014 and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work.\n\nGPT-4o gets an upgrade\n\nOpenAI announced that its GPT-4o model has been updated to feature more \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cengaging\u201d creative writing abilities as well as more thorough responses and insights when accessing files uploaded by users.\n\nGPT-4o got an update \ud83c\udf89\n\n\n\nThe model\u2019s creative writing ability has leveled up\u2013more natural, engaging, and tailored writing to improve relevance & readability.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also better at working with uploaded files, providing deeper insights & more thorough responses. \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) November 20, 2024\n\nOpenAI brings ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode to the web\n\nChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode feature is expanding to the web, allowing users to talk to the chatbot through their browser.

When the feature is enabled, OpenAI will automatically send the section of code you\u2019re working on through its chatbot as context, alongside your prompt.\n\nOpenAI loses another lead safety researcher\n\nLilian Weng announced on X that she is departing OpenAI. Weng served as VP of research and safety since August, and before that was the head of OpenAI\u2019s safety systems team. It\u2019s the latest in a long string of AI safety researchers,policy researchers, and other executives who have exited the company in the last year.\n\nAfter working at OpenAI for almost 7 years, I decide to leave. I learned so much and now I'm ready for a reset and something new.\n\n\n\nHere is the note I just shared with the team. \ud83e\ude75 pic.twitter.com/2j9K3oBhPC \u2014 Lilian Weng (@lilianweng) November 8, 2024\n\nChatGPT told 2M people to get their election news elsewhere\n\nOpenAI stated that it told around 2 million users of ChatGPT to go elsewhere for information about the 2024 U.S. election, and instead recommended trusted news sources like Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI said that ChatGPT sent roughly a million people to CanIVote.org when they asked questions specific to voting in the lead-up to the election and rejected around 250,000 requests to generate images of the candidates over the same period.\n\nOpenAI acquires Chat.com\n\nAdding to its collection of high-profile domain names, Chat.com now redirects to ChatGPT. Last year, it was reported that HubSpot co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah acquired Chat.com for $15.5 million, making it one of the top two all-time publicly reported domain sales \u2014 though OpenAI declined to state how much it paid for it.\n\nMeta\u2019s former hardware lead for Orion is joining OpenAI\n\nThe former head of Meta\u2019s augmented reality glasses efforts is joining OpenAI to lead robotics and consumer hardware. Kalinowski is a hardware executive who began leading Meta\u2019s AR glasses team in March 2022. She oversaw the creation of Orion, the impressive augmented reality prototype that Meta recently showed off at its annual Connect conference.\n\nApple users will soon be able to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus in the Settings app\n\nApple is including an option to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus inside its Settings app, according to an update to the iOS 18.2 beta spotted by 9to5Mac. This will give Apple users a direct route to sign up for OpenAI\u2019s premium subscription plan, which costs $20 a month.\n\nOctober 2024\n\nSam Altman says a lack of compute capacity is delaying product releases\n\nIn a Reddit AMA, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that a lack of compute capacity is one major factor preventing the company from shipping products as often as it\u2019d like, including the vision capabilities for Advanced Voice Mode first teased in May. Altman also indicated that the next major release of DALL-E, OpenAI\u2019s image generator, has no launch timeline, and that Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video-generating tool, has also been held back.\n\nAltman also admitted to using ChatGPT \u201csometimes\u201d to answer questions throughout the AMA.\n\nOpenAI launches its Google search challenger\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Search, an evolution of the SearchGPT prototype it unveiled this summer. Powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model, ChatGPT Search serves up information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources, at which point you can ask follow-up questions to refine an ongoing search.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Introducing ChatGPT search \ud83c\udf10\n\n\n\nChatGPT can now search the web in a much better way than before so you get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.https://t.co/7yilNgqH9T pic.twitter.com/z8mJWS8J9c \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) October 31, 2024\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode comes to Mac and PC\n\nOpenAI has rolled out Advanced Voice Mode to ChatGPT\u2019s desktop apps for macOS and Windows.

How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",

                "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, released Grok 3, its long-awaited flagship AI model, last week. Grok 3 powers the Grok chatbot apps for mobile and the web, as well as the Grok experience on the Musk-owned social network X.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s so much competition in the AI chatbot space these days, it wasn\u2019t a foregone conclusion that Grok 3 would make much of an impact. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT alone has grown to 400 million weekly active users. However, preliminary data suggests that the new model has indeed gotten people to download and try Grok.\n\nAccording to estimates from Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, worldwide and U.S. mobile app downloads of Grok during the week of Grok 3\u2019s release increased more than 10x each compared to the previous week. Daily active users for Grok\u2019s U.S. app soared more than 260% last week, meanwhile, while global daily active users climbed 5x week-over-week.\n\nMuddying the waters somewhat is the fact that Grok 3\u2019s release coincided with the Grok app\u2019s expansion to several markets in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Some of the app\u2019s global growth is likely attributable to this.\n\nGrok\u2019s web app also saw growth over the same period, though, independent of the mobile apps. According to digital intelligence platform Similarweb, U.S. daily visits to the Grok web app \u2014 to be specific, Grok.com \u2014 increased from around 189,000 to more than 900,000 in the days following Grok 3\u2019s release. Worldwide, daily visits grew from 627,000 to 4.5 million.\n\nThey\u2019re impressive numbers, to be sure. But the big question is whether xAI can maintain the momentum and retain those users.\n\nRecent controversies threaten to dampen enthusiasm for Grok 3. Over the weekend, the model briefly censored certain unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, a change that xAI attributed to a rogue employee. A few days earlier, users discovered that Grok 3 would consistently say that President Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty. xAI quickly patched that issue, as well.",

                "text": "DeepSeek has gone viral.\n\nChinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek\u2019s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts \u2014 and technologists \u2014 to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.\n\nBut where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s trader origins\n\nDeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.\n\nAI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.\n\nIn 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.\n\nFrom day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s strong models\n\nDeepSeek unveiled its first set of models \u2014 DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat \u2014 in November 2023. But it wasn\u2019t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.\n\nDeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks \u2014 and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek\u2019s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.\n\nDeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek\u2019s notoriety.\n\nAccording to DeepSeek\u2019s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta\u2019s Llama and \u201cclosed\u201d models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.\n\nEqually impressive is DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI\u2019s o1 model on key benchmarks.\n\nBeing a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.\n\nThere is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek\u2019s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they\u2019re subject to benchmarking by China\u2019s internet regulator to ensure that its responses \u201cembody core socialist values.\u201d In DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot app, for example, R1 won\u2019t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan\u2019s autonomy.\n\nA disruptive approach\n\nIf DeepSeek has a business model, it\u2019s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value \u2014 and gives others away for free.\n\nThe way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however.\n\nWhatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek\u2019s models, which aren\u2019t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek\u2019s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 \u201cderivative\u201d models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \u201cupending AI\u201d and \u201cover-hyped.\u201d The company\u2019s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia\u2019s stock price to drop by 18% on Monday, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nMicrosoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft\u2019s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek\u2019s impact on Meta\u2019s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a \u201cstrategic advantage\u201d for Meta.\n\nAt the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.\n\nAs for what DeepSeek\u2019s future might hold, it\u2019s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

                "text": "By Ricardo Amper\n\n\n\nThe digital revolution has reshaped industries and everyday life, unlocking unprecedented opportunities. Yet, beneath its promise lies a growing menace: critical vulnerabilities that threaten the very systems we rely on. When systems falter\u2014from financial networks that underpin economies to public services essential to daily activities\u2014the resulting chaos ripples across societies, disrupting businesses, eroding trust, and endangering livelihoods.\n\nEnter \u201cFraud as a Service\u201d (FaaS), a sinister twist on the \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d (SaaS) model that has revolutionized legitimate industries. Fueled by deepfake technology and scalable tools, FaaS has proliferated on the dark web, evolving\n\ninto accessible and affordable platforms. These platforms target and exploit our digital lifelines, amplifying fraud to an unprecedented heights.\n\nCybercriminals no longer need sophisticated tools or advanced technical expertise to execute disruptive illegal activities. The barriers to accessing AI and deepfake devices have virtually disappeared\u2014they are now just a few clicks away.\n\nMultiple reports reveal an alarming surge in fraudulent incidents within the fintech industry, with increases of several hundred percent in 2023, highlighting the growing scale and accessibility of these schemes.\n\nFaaS platforms offer generative AI-powered fraud services through subscription like models, enabling even non-technical users to deploy realistic voice, video, and image manipulations. For as little as $20, anyone can impersonate executives, forge identities, or create convincing videos to bypass security protocols.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just fraud\u2014it\u2019s fraud at an industrial scale. A single individual can now target thousands of employees simultaneously. In short, welcome to the democratization of fraud.\n\nFighting Back in the New Digital Age\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, the battle against fraud in this digital era is far from hopeless. While traditional security systems\u2014such as passwords, knowledge based authentication, and basic biometric checks\u2014are proving increasingly inadequate, multi-layered approaches are emerging as robust solutions to these growing threats and problems.\n\nFraudsters can exploit outdated technologies to bypass identity checks that rely solely on static images or voice recordings. However, innovative solutions, such as advanced biometric technologies paired with comprehensive fraud detection systems, are rendering such practices ineffective.\n\nAt Incode, the company I co-founded nearly a decade ago, we developed a wide-ranging variety of tools that not only verify identities but also actively distinguish between genuine and fraudulent users, eliminating digital vulnerabilities at their source.\n\nSome of the key solutions we offer to prevent and detect fraudulent activities include:\n\nAdvanced Personhood Detection: Real-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks.\n\nReal-time liveness detection, facial recognition, and document verification ensure that only authorized individuals gain access to digital networks. Streamlined Integration: A frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions.\n\nA frictionless setup within existing technology stacks accelerates deployment and enhances verification for sensitive interactions. Continuous Identity Monitoring: AI-driven monitoring tracks and highlights suspicious identity signals across interactions, enabling proactive defenses against generative AI threats.\n\nThese technologies allow organizations to build a robust ecosystem capable of combating the evolving tactics of fraudsters, securing digital systems, and restoring trust in the digital age.\n\nThe once-reliable multi-factor authentication (MFA) system, a cornerstone of modern security, is increasingly inadequate against sophisticated attacks. AI has significantly undermined its effectiveness; by mimicking vocal patterns or generating lifelike images, attackers can easily bypass MFA, making social engineering attacks more prevalent than ever. Meanwhile, physical identification methods, such as ID documents, are equally vulnerable to digital manipulation.\n\nIn short, most traditional security systems are no match for the new capabilities of generative AI.\n\nTo combat these advanced threats, Incode\u2019s cutting-edge technology provides the robust solutions organizations are seeking to safeguard their operations. Our tools address these vulnerabilities head-on, offering reliable protection against the costly, disruptive consequences of AI-driven fraud.\n\nFinancial Sector: A Canary in the Coal Mine\n\nBanks and financial institutions are on the frontlines of this battle. In 2024, a Hong Kong firm lost $25 million after an employee fell victim to a deepfake video impersonating their CFO. This was not an isolated incident; many such cases remain unreported. Generative AI\u2019s ability to produce hyper-realistic content has made it an ideal weapon for fraudsters.\n\nAccording to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, AI-enabled fraud losses are projected to grow to $40 billion in 2027, from $12.3 billion in 2023 \u2013or more than quadruple its estimated current cost. The financial sector\u2019s reliance on identity verification, trust, and authenticity makes it uniquely vulnerable to such threats, necessitating a robust response.\n\nIncode Workforce: Protecting Organizations at Scale\n\nOur Incode Workforce platform exemplifies a multi-layered approach. Designed to secure access at every stage of the employee lifecycle, it enhances Identity Access Management Systems (IAM), integrating advanced personhood detection, seamless biometric verification, and fraud detection. Whether onboarding remote employees or safeguarding sensitive operations, Incode Workforce ensures that only verified, living individuals interact with your business systems and assets.\n\nIn partnership with Okta, the leading independent Identity partner that frees everyone to safely use any technology, we\u2019ve even extended our capabilities to enable organizations to securely verify the \u201creal world identity\u201d of who they\u2019re interacting with.\n\nThe Incode-Okta Workforce Identity integration strengthens security for high-risk scenarios such as:\n\nIdentity Verification at MFA Enrollment: . Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment.\n\n. Enabling identity proofing for all employees before MFA enrollment. Help Desk and Account Recovery: Minimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets.\n\nMinimize social engineering risks by automating identity validation and reducing support tickets. Step-Up Verification for Critical Workflows: Secure high-value transactions through our biometric verification, protect sensitive data access, and more.\n\n\u201cAs a security practitioner, I see Incode\u2019s partnership with Okta as a pivotal step in addressing emerging threats like AI-driven fraud. The combination of biometric verification with robust IAM capabilities ensures a higher standard of security for enterprises navigating today\u2019s complex risk landscape,\u201d said Mukund Sarma, Security Lead at Chime.\n\nKeeping Pace: Accelerating Fraud Prevention\n\nAs FaaS continues to evolve, fraud is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Defenses must keep up. By investing in advanced biometric systems and adopting proactive, multi-layered defense strategies, organizations can stay ahead of these escalating challenges.\n\nIncode\u2019s recognition as a Leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Identity Verification highlights our commitment to innovation and excellence in addressing these critical issues. This achievement reflects our technological leadership and validates our focus on building trust through cutting-edge solutions.\n\nBeing named a Leader underscores the strength of our robust, scalable, and user-friendly solutions to combat AI-driven fraud. It reaffirms our belief that organizations can achieve top-tier security without compromising agility or customer experience.\n\nAt Incode, our mission is to empower businesses with the tools to not only defend against today\u2019s threats but also anticipate tomorrow\u2019s challenges. With industry-leading solutions and an unwavering commitment to trust, we\u2019re ensuring the digital world remains a secure and reliable foundation for global progress.\n\nRicardo Amper is the CEO of ID verification and fraud prevention company Incode",

                "text": "Breaking Banking Barriers in Mexico\n\nWhat if getting a loan in Mexico was as easy as ordering a burger on your phone? Crediclub, a fast-growing fintech, is rewriting the rules of financial inclusion with AI-driven lending and digital-first savings and financial services. By cutting bureaucracy and enabling instant loan approvals, the company is bridging the financial gap for millions of underserved Mexicans\u2014one transaction at a time.\n\nIn a country where over 50% of the economy operates informally, traditional banking has left millions without access to fair credit and savings solutions. But Crediclub is changing that. With a digital-first model, AI-powered risk assessments, and a $85 million funding round led by L Catterton, the company is expanding its reach, fueling economic growth, and proving that fintech can be a force for financial empowerment.\n\nFrom Savings Platform to Full-fledged Fintech Disruption\n\nCrediclub\u2019s Savings Platform, SuperTasas.com, made its appearance in 2016, becoming Mexico\u2019s first fully digital, high return, savings platform. It offers investments from as little as one peso\u2014with zero commissions, remarkable returns, and high security (backed by a Moody\u2019s A+ rating).\n\nFast forward to 2024, and Crediclub has scaled massively, deploying US$750M in loans, mainly to women owning small businesses, also including in its portfolio credit cards, buy now pay later, savings and insurance solutions, with a customer centric and digital first approach.\n\nUnlike traditional banks, which impose high barriers and extensive paperwork, Crediclub\u2019s AI-driven 5-1 Model collects customer\u2019s data in 5 minutes, making the approval decision in 1 second. Currently 80% of its annually granted 600k loans are approved under this model, leveraging cloud-based analytics, alternative data and behavioral models.\n\nKey Differentiator: While 75-90% of Mexico\u2019s transactions are still cash-based, Crediclub is actively accelerating the country\u2019s transition to digital finance by integrating cutting-edge generative AI and machine learning.\n\nScaling Innovation with Data & Strategic Partnerships\n\nBeyond speed, Crediclub\u2019s competitive edge lies in its tech stack. With partnerships including VISA, Galileo, Oracle and Microsoft Azure, the company has built a data-powered ecosystem designed to refine risk assessment and unlock financial opportunities at scale.\n\nKey innovations include:\n\nData Ring & Data Ring Canvas \u2013 Proprietary analytics tools that transform raw data into real-time financial insights.\n\nAI-Powered Credit Scoring \u2013 Alternative data sources, including behavioral patterns, enable faster and more inclusive lending.\n\nEmbedded Finance \u2013 Seamless integration with e-commerce and digital payment ecosystems.\n\nThese advancements aren\u2019t just about efficiency\u2014they\u2019re setting new benchmarks for financial accessibility in emerging markets.\n\nMeet the Founders Shaping Mexico\u2019s Fintech Future\n\nAt the helm of Crediclub is Juan Francisco Fernandez, who co-founded the company along with Gabriel Ruelas nearly two decades ago with a bold vision: to break down the financial barriers that have long excluded millions of Mexicans.\n\nTheir passion comes from personal experience.

                "text": "By Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries and creating extraordinary opportunities for startups to thrive. For founders, AI offers vast potential\u2014but maximizing that opportunity requires access to powerful, reliable, and affordable tools. This is where modern cloud computing proves invaluable.\n\nCloud infrastructure that integrates high throughput and low latency networking, storage, and the latest GPUs empowers startups to build, train, and deploy AI models without becoming distributed computing PhDs. These tools take on the heavy lifting, allowing founders to focus on solving meaningful problems, scaling their businesses, and bringing their ideas to life \u2013 faster.\n\nAs AI startups navigate a shifting landscape of privacy regulations, fierce competition for computing power, and pressure from industry incumbents, they face critical decisions about their infrastructure. Let\u2019s explore the key considerations for success\u2014and how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) delivers unmatched value, end-to-end capabilities, and robust computing power to help startups build, serve, and scale their AI models and applications cost-effectively.\n\nEnterprise-Grade AI Power for Startups on Demand\n\nFirst, Oracle gives startups access to some of the world\u2019s biggest AI clusters \u2014 comparable to those that Meta and xAI build for their own massive AI workloads. That brings a lot of power for startups to apply to their own workloads on a pay-as-they-go basis. Currently, companies such as Evidium, Inworld, Suno, and more are leveraging OCI AI infrastructure to deliver the computing power and performance they need to build their next-generation AI solutions. Use of OCI gives these startups a leg up if they want to work with the huge installed base of Oracle Database and Fusion Applications customers. In addition, OCI has startup accelerator programs which provides free credits for startups up to $100K, so startups can get more out of their investment while building cutting-edge new solutions.1\n\nScalability remains critical. OCI\u2019s Zettascale cluster capability can offer aggregate network throughput of 100 petabytes per second with only microseconds of latency from machine-to-machine. This scale was unheard of in the industry until just a few months ago. By combining this high-powered network with OCI\u2019s advanced storage solutions, startups can train models faster, run workloads more efficiently, and achieve a better total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nRun Faster, Pay Less\n\nCost is a big deal for small-but-growing companies, and the architecture you choose should deliver high performance while training and serving generative AI models cost-effectively. AI startups should look for infrastructure that\u2019s optimized to run these workloads faster on a true pay-as-you-go pricing model\u2014like OCI. Unlike others, OCI has the same low price globally, so you don\u2019t have the overhead and complexity of picking from thousands of different compute SKUs. Remember, for startups as well as larger companies, the faster your jobs run, the less you pay.\n\nFurthermore, OCI offers a complete platform that goes beyond just training models. Unlike GPU-only specialists, once you\u2019re ready to launch your product, OCI provides the best value for hosting your model and applications. Or if you want to deploy the industry\u2019s leading LLMs from Hugging Face, Meta, Mistral, and others for your own use you can do this via OCI Data Science with just a few clicks. By combining high-speed performance with a comprehensive suite of tools, OCI is uniquely positioned to help startups succeed in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nPutting Security and Reliability at the Core\n\nSecurity anchors our platform. Customer A\u2019s data must never be accessible to Customer B\u2014by accident or otherwise. Strong data isolation and clear policies govern how data is managed and used for training AI models, helping ensure trust and compliance. Being able to share a cluster network across multiple jobs run by a startup or a startup\u2019s customers with strong isolation provides higher security, protects sensitive information, and enables startups to innovate with confidence. This foundation matters because the quality of data directly drives the quality of AI outcomes.\n\nBy building security and reliability into every layer of the platform Oracle ensures that startups can focus on developing cutting-edge AI solutions, and worry less about data breaches or compliance issues. Startups and enterprises alike trust Oracle\u2019s infrastructure to safeguard their data while supporting their innovation goals.\n\nInnovation Beyond GPUs: The Role of Resiliency, Networking and Distributed Cloud\n\nStartups require an AI platform that minimizes the need to directly manage resources. What they need is a reliable, high-performance platform that gets the fundamentals right including a great network and great storage. Even minor failures in AI infrastructure disrupt workflows and waste valuable resources. OCI mitigates these risks with robust fault-tolerant architecture, which ensures developers can focus on solving critical business challenges instead of troubleshooting interruptions.\n\nOf course, raw compute power is key, but AI workloads depend on more than the fastest GPUs. Networking also plays a critical role, and Oracle introduced innovations that streamline those technologies.\n\nTake RoCE or RDMA over Converged Ethernet networking for example. RDMA has powered Oracle Exadata databases for decades, and we were the first to run multi-tenant workloads on RoCE\u2014even before AI became mainstream. By applying optimized RoCE to enable seamless communication across tens of thousands of GPUs, we can deliver multiple gigaflops of performance per cluster, giving startups the efficiency and scalability needed. We also support InfiniBand networking for use cases such as AI training that require ultra-low latency to offer our customers choices in leading networking technologies. In addition, Oracle works closely with partners and industry leaders, driving standards through initiatives like UEC to deliver the best performance for AI workloads.\n\nFor over a decade, cloud providers focused on delivering cloud services in a handful of public cloud regions. OCI changed that equation by making full cloud services available for specific governments, for the EU, and even on-premises. This provides new ways for AI startups to provide their services and for customers to consume them. OCI\u2019s deployment options\u2014which allow companies to run their cloud services securely in a sovereign cloud setting\u2014are attractive to startups targeting markets with strict data location and privacy requirements.\n\nStartups like Fireworks AI are already leveraging these innovations. By using OCI\u2019s high-performance AI solutions with industry-leading RDMA networking, the startup is building a hyper-optimized inferencing engine to help other startups maximize the value of their GPUs\u2014an essential step in deploying AI models efficiently.\n\nUnlocking the Transformative Potential of Cloud AI\n\nThink about the transition from the Yellow Pages to Google Search\u2014a revolution that drastically sped access to information, whether it was finding a restaurant or mapping out the fastest route. Cloud-enabled AI takes this transformation much further. It doesn\u2019t just save time; it effectively shrinks the time it takes to perform complex tasks and creates entirely new possibilities. AI agents can now collaborate with each other to solve complex problems across industries, enabling faster research, deeper insights into behaviors, and improved trend analysis.\n\nThis rapid pace of innovation requires robust cloud infrastructure to sustain growth. With OCI, startups have access to the same versatile and cost-effective tools leveraged by the world\u2019s leading enterprises. This enables these businesses to focus on their core vision, without the distractions of managing hardware or worrying about prohibitive costs.\n\nStartups can find out more at the OCI AI Solutions Hub and check out developer sandboxes or packaged deployments of popular software.\n\n1Available to startups nominated by Oracle that meet specific qualification criteria.

                "text": "By Rajeev Behera, CEO of Every\n\nMost founders spend their time thinking about product-market fit and customer acquisition strategies. But there\u2019s a critical foundation that often gets overlooked: the legal structure of your company. Get this wrong, and you might find yourself unable to raise capital, regardless of your startup\u2019s potential.\n\nHaving raised over $130M across multiple companies \u2014 first with Reflektive (acquired) and now with Every \u2014 I\u2019ve seen how early incorporation decisions can significantly impact a startup\u2019s ability to raise capital. The process isn\u2019t particularly complex, but it requires attention to specific details that many first-time founders miss.\n\nLeave your job first\n\nYou must leave your current position before incorporating your new startup. The primary reason is intellectual property rights \u2014 most employment contracts have broad IP assignment clauses that could give your employer claims to your startup\u2019s IP. While there may be legal workarounds to this situation, they require careful navigation with an experienced startup attorney. It is very risky to try to figure this out on your own. For most founders, the decision to leave and incorporate a startup typically arrives at one of two critical moments: either when you\u2019ve secured your first customer, or when an investor expresses serious interest. These triggers often provide the concrete validation needed to leave your former career behind and make the leap to being a founder.\n\nIncorporate in Delaware as a C-Corp\n\nVCs and angel investors will only invest in Delaware C-Corporations. Period. Try to pitch them an LLC or a corporation registered in another state, and you\u2019ll likely get a hard pass before they even look at your business metrics.\n\nWhy? C-Corporations provide the standard share issuance and governance structure that investors require. And Delaware isn\u2019t just another state choice \u2014 it\u2019s the gold standard, offering investor-friendly tax laws, robust legal protections, and clear corporate governance guidelines that VCs understand inside and out. Nearly half of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. are incorporated in Delaware for good reason.\n\nWhile you can technically restructure your company later, it\u2019s an expensive and time-consuming process that can derail funding rounds. Starting with a Delaware C-Corp from day one removes this potential roadblock.\n\nStructure your stock to maximize your returns\n\nLet\u2019s talk about structuring your founder shares strategically. While there are certain terms investors won\u2019t budge on \u2014 like a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff \u2014 there\u2019s room to optimize the structure in your favor.\n\nHere\u2019s a founder-friendly move that most investors will be ok with: the double trigger acceleration clause. This provision accelerates your vesting if two things happen: your company gets acquired, and you\u2019re terminated. Without this protection, you could find yourself pushed out with a significant portion of your equity still unvested. With it, you maintain leverage in acquisition scenarios and protect your upside. Smart investors understand and accept this term, so don\u2019t leave it on the table.\n\nUse incorporation docs that are built for tech startups\n\nA costly mistake I often see founders make: using incorporation documents with generic instead of startup-specific verbiage. When investors conduct due diligence, they\u2019ll expect to see startup-specific clauses in your incorporation documents. If your paperwork doesn\u2019t match what they\u2019re used to, you\u2019ll end up spending thousands in legal fees to restructure everything.\n\nAt Every, we\u2019ve built our incorporation documents specifically for this purpose \u2014 setting up your company to be investible while maximizing founder returns. Like everything else we do, these documents have been crafted based on our experience operating multiple tech startups. We handle all the setup work to ensure your documentation matches exactly what tech investors expect to see.\n\n\n\nGet Started with Every.io and incorporate your startup correctly for $0.",

The idea is that the same entrepreneurial spirit and niche expertise that has helped creators build community is what would make them great founders.\n\nAccording to Slow Ventures partner Megan Lightcap, it comes down to trust and audience attachment.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about creators is oftentimes they start [on YouTube], right? Because it\u2019s the most obvious place to begin,\u201d Lightcap explains, \u201cBut the difference between creator-led opportunities and what opportunities may exist for an existing brand is that, because the audience attaches to the creator as a whole person, the surface area and permission of what they can go build is actually much greater than, you know, a singular product coming.\u201d\n\nToday on Equity, Rebecca Bellan sits down with Lightcap to dive into the unique way Slow Ventures has structured its creator fund, why YouTube remains the dominant platform for serious creators, how niche community trust translates into scalable businesses, and what this new fund means for the creator economy.\n\nListen to the full episode to hear more about:\n\nHow this \u201cnew asset class\u201d has the potential to scale.\n\nThe firm\u2019s success stories so far, including Marina Mogilko\u2019s baby snack company and other ventures.\n\nThe parallels between backing creators and traditional seed-stage founders.\n\nThe \u201ckey man risk\u201d and how investors navigate the challenge.\n\nEquity is TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nSubscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

                "text": "Creating corporate training videos for software is a time-consuming ordeal, especially if you\u2019re an organization with a lot of software licenses. Training videos can help get employees up to speed, but they\u2019re a big lift. They often take entire teams to produce.\n\nTel Aviv-based entrepreneur Yoav Einav thought there might be an alternative, cheaper way to create software training videos. So he teamed up with a friend, Dan Sahar, to try to build it. In 2020, their project became a startup: Guidde.\n\nGuidde uses AI to automatically create video clips that instruct viewers on how to use different applications. It works by capturing a user\u2019s in-app activity, and then transforming the recording into a video with a \u201cstoryline.\u201d\n\nGuidde-created videos can optionally feature an AI-generated voice in a desired language, background music, and tags that highlight key aspects of a software app\u2019s functionality. Guidde also offers basic video editing tools with effects such as motion transitions, frame timing adjustment, and cropping.\n\nGuidde\u2019s platform lets users create and customize corporate training videos for applications. Image Credits:Guidde\n\nYou might be wondering: Do people actually watch training videos? It\u2019s a fair question. According to a 2019 Kaltura survey, 67% of employees admit to not giving in-house training videos their full attention, instead skimming the videos or listening to them while doing something else.\n\nEinav thinks it\u2019s a two-pronged issue. Often, he said, training videos aren\u2019t very compelling \u2014 the production quality isn\u2019t particularly high. On top of that, the videos tend to be buried in tough-to-navigate interfaces.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in recent months, Guidde has dipped a toe into video recommendations, launching a feature called Guidde Broadcast that delivers personalized content to a company\u2019s staff. Einav described it as a \u201cNetflix for organizations\u201d \u2014 a way to drive software engagement by providing contextual, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d training content within a user\u2019s workflow.\n\nGuidde is on a steady positive growth trajectory, according to Einav, having increased revenue by four times in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s platform now serves over 100,000 users across 2,000 organizations, including American Eagle Outfitters, Carta, and Nasdaq.\n\nGuidde\u2019s tools tap AI to automate certain aspects of the video production and publishing process. Image Credits:Guidde\n\nThis month, 35-employee Guidde secured $15 million in new funding in a round led by Qualcomm Ventures. Bringing the startup\u2019s total raised to $30 million, the new cash will be used to expand Guidde\u2019s localization tools, enterprise sales and customer success teams, and global market presence, Einav said.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to weather the storm so far, and continue to take a conservative and humble approach to our finances \u2014 a strategy that has proven effective so far,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that the future lies in a solution that seamlessly combines creation and delivery of highly engaging AI-driven and video-first content. Our goal is to lead this emerging category and set the standard for intelligent, immersive content experiences.\u201d",

                "text": "Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has announced her new startup. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s focused on AI.\n\nCalled Thinking Machines Lab, the startup, which came out of stealth today, intends to build tooling to \u201cmake AI work for [people\u2019s] unique needs and goals,\u201d and to create AI systems that are \u201cmore widely understood, customizable, and generally capable\u201d than those currently available.\n\nMurati is heading up Thinking Machines Lab as CEO. OpenAI co-founder John Schulman is the company\u2019s chief scientist, and Barret Zoph, OpenAI\u2019s ex-chief research officer, is the CTO.\n\nIn a blog post shared with TechCrunch, Thinking Machines Lab wrote that while AI capabilities have advanced dramatically, \u201ckey gaps\u201d remain.\n\n\u201cThe scientific community\u2019s understanding of frontier AI systems lags behind rapidly advancing capabilities,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cKnowledge of how these systems are trained is concentrated within the top research labs, limiting both the public discourse on AI and people\u2019s abilities to use AI effectively. And, despite their potential, these systems remain difficult for people to customize to their specific needs and values.\u201d\n\nThinking Machines Lab plans to focus on building \u201cmultimodal\u201d systems that \u201cwork with people collaboratively,\u201d according to the blog post, and that can \u201cadapt to the full spectrum of human expertise and enable a broader spectrum\u201d of applications.\n\n\u201c[W]e are building models at the frontier of capabilities in domains like science and programming,\u201d the blog post stated. \u201cUltimately, the most advanced models will unlock the most transformative applications and benefits, such as enabling novel scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs.\u201d\n\nAI safety will be another core tenet of Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s work. The company said that it plans to contribute to safety by preventing misuse of the models it releases, sharing best practices and recipes for how to build safe AI systems with the industry, and supporting external research on alignment by sharing code, datasets, and model specifications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll focus on understanding how our systems create genuine value in the real world,\u201d Thinking Machines Lab wrote in its blog post. \u201cThe most important breakthroughs often come from rethinking our objectives, not just optimizing existing metrics.\u201d\n\nMurati left OpenAI last October after six years at the company. At the time, she said she was stepping away to \u201cdo her own exploration.\u201d\n\nMurati came to OpenAI in 2018 as VP of applied AI and partnerships. After being promoted to CTO in 2022, she led the company\u2019s work on ChatGPT, the text-to-image AI DALL-E, and the code-generating system Codex, which powered early versions of GitHub\u2019s Copilot programming assistant.\n\nMirati was briefly OpenAI\u2019s interim CEO after CEO Sam Altman\u2019s abrupt firing. Altman has described her as a close ally.\n\nFor months, rumors have flown of Murati hiring high-profile AI researchers and staffers for an AI venture. Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s blog lists 29 employees from OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind, among other top firms.\n\nThinking Machines Lab is actively hiring machine learning scientists and engineers, as well as a research program manager, per the company\u2019s post.\n\nAt one point, Murati was said to be in talks to raise over $100 million from unnamed VC firms. The blog didn\u2019t confirm or deny this.\n\nBefore OpenAI, Murati spent three years at Tesla as a senior product manager of the Model X, the automaker\u2019s crossover SUV, during which Tesla released early versions of Autopilot, its AI-enabled driver-assistance software. She also was VP of product and engineering at Leap Motion, a startup building hand- and finger-tracking motion sensors for PCs.\n\nMurati joins a growing list of former OpenAI execs launching startups, including rivals such as Ilya Sutskever\u2019s Safe Superintelligence and Anthropic.\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "When he was a senior studying at Texas A&M University, Matthew Iommi realized that there were no good options for transporting groups of people. Fellow college students heading out for the night together didn\u2019t have access to on-demand rides with the same convenience, accessibility, and affordability of typical ride-hail platforms, like Uber and Lyft.\n\n\u201cOnce you hit that six to seven [person] mark, you had to split up and take multiple cars, which is inefficient and not great for sustainability. Plus it\u2019s an inferior experience because everyone can\u2019t ride together,\u201d Iommi, now 28, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe other option was to reserve a charter vehicle days or weeks in advance.\u201d\n\nThe latter choice usually entails paying for more hours than the group needs the ride, with no easy way to split the payment between friends.\n\nIn 2020, he and his co-founder Justin Rath decided to buy a party bus and experiment with creating an on-demand group rideshare service that serves between seven to 14 passengers. They named it Fetii, a French Oceanic term for an extension of one\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cWe like to say that the mantra of rideshare is bringing people together,\u201d Iommi said.\n\nFive years later, Fetii now claims to be operating in 68 cities across six states \u2014 including Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Phoenix, and Scottsdale \u2014 and transporting over 200,000 passengers each month. And while Fetii does offer the ability to reserve rides in advance, Iommi says the majority \u2014 75% to 80% \u2014 are on-demand.\n\nThe Austin-based startup has closed a $7.35 million seed round led by Mark Cuban, with participation from Y Combinator, Goodwater Capital, and others. Fetii will use that money to expand into new markets, including Florida, California, and Massachusetts.\n\nFor young people, by young people\n\nFetii co-founder and CEO Matthew Iommi Image Credits:Fetii\n\nFetii isn\u2019t the first startup to build a business around group rides. Years ago, there was Chariot, a commuter shuttle startup that Ford acquired in 2016, before shutting it down in 2019. Iommi explains that Chariot\u2019s focus on employee and commuter rides is a difficult model because it only requires service for a couple of hours in the morning and a couple of hours in the evening.\n\nIn 2022, Uber launched Uber Charter in partnership with US Coachways as a way to help riders book party buses and passenger vans through the app, but that quietly went bust, too.\n\nThese failures were lessons for Iommi and Rath. As a couple of college kids bootstrapping a startup they, \u201chad to figure out a way to launch in a city without burning millions of dollars, like these rideshare companies typically do whenever they just raise these huge rounds and just try to figure it out.\u201d\n\nRather than target corporate events, weddings, or other use cases that charter companies typically focus on at the start, Fetii honed in on college students.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the biggest thing that people before us haven\u2019t figured out, is creating a service and a brand that\u2019s more geared towards young adults and people who tend to congregate in groups more often,\u201d Iommi said.\n\nMost of Fetii\u2019s riders are between 21 and 30 years old, and the platform\u2019s use cases range from nights out and bachelorette parties to weddings and sports games. Fetii also provides rides for groups doing corporate events, conferences, and festivals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re using us multiple times a week, whether it\u2019s just to go out with friends or they have a formal or an event or anything like that,\u201d Iommi said.\n\nThinking through the payments system was also a unique challenge for Fetii.\n\n\u201cWhen that van shows up, the way [riders] pay is a lot like Lime and Bird by scanning a QR code, so each person in the group \u2014 rather than one person having to put the whole payment down and hope they get paid back \u2014 can individually pay their fare,\u201d Iommi said, noting that the typical fare is about $5 per person.\n\nBy focusing on college students first, Fetii has developed a playbook to scale.\n\n\u201cWe like to start on universities first. We partner with a lot of the orgs, the sports teams, the fraternities, the sororities, and really teach them how the product is used,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first ride is always free, which Iommi says helps Fetii build a foundation in the college community. This allows the startup to attract drivers and ensures that there\u2019s a supply-demand equilibrium.\n\nFetii uses a program called \u201cFetii VSP\u201d (vehicle service provider), which allows entities with their own fleets and drivers to put their vans on Fetii\u2019s platform.\n\nOnce the startup establishes a base in colleges, it expands outward. People start seeing branded Fetii vans driving around and word of mouth spreads. As Iommi pointed out, each rider in a group can be converted into a customer, who can then go on to convert others, resulting in healthy, cost-efficient growth.\n\nIn fact, it was rave reviews from one user, Mark Cuban\u2019s daughter, that attracted the billionaire investor and former \u201cShark Tank\u201d star to Fetii\u2019s seed round.\n\n\u201cMy daughter used Fetii nonstop with her friends and raved about it,\u201d Cuban told TechCrunch. \u201cShe told me I should invest. So I reached out to Matthew and the more I heard about it, the more I liked it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Cuban was trying to make up for rejecting an offer to invest in Uber in 2009, he said: \u201cUber was first, so it was a different market back then. Fetii has a chance to be global and do amazing things.\u201d\n\nIommi told TechCrunch that when he started the business, an Uber or Lyft acquisition was top of mind as an exit strategy. That changed over time, though Fetii would still be interested in partnering with the ride-hail giants.\n\nCuban also didn\u2019t seem jazzed about Fetii going the M&A route. \u201cI always prefer to be obscenely profitable and throw off cash,\u201d he said.",

                "text": "Last decade, companies like Segment rewrote the book on how organizations used APIs to merge data from disparate apps to improve marketing strategies. Today, a startup called Hightouch \u2014 co-founded by a former engineering manager at Segment \u2014 is announcing $80 million in funding for the next chapter: a platform that lets sales, marketing, and customer service teams synchronize data warehouses and other locations, along with AI agents to do that work and build those experiences for them.\n\nSapphire Ventures is leading this Series C round, with NVC, Amplify Ventures, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, and Y Combinator also participating. The funding, notably, catapults Hightouch to a $1.2 billion post-money valuation. For some context on that valuation, it roughly doubles the company\u2019s valuation from its last round in 2023.\n\nThe funding will be used to continue developing Hightouch\u2019s technology, as well as for business development and hiring.\n\nTejas Manohar \u2014 the co-CEO of Hightouch, who co-founded the company with Kashish Gupta (co-CEO) and Josh Curl (CTO) \u2014 said that at Segment, where he and Curl were also colleagues, there was work to be done beyond building a way to use APIs to improve integrations. That was a key evolution, but it was one that took a page from how developers worked, and thus could be too technical to execute in practice due to the number of data sources an organization might use.\n\n\u201cAsking customers to get data into Segment was an onerous task,\u201d Manohar recalled, not least because data from warehouses, where a lot of data ended up, was primarily used for analytics \u2014 not marketing \u2014 purposes.\n\nIn 2019, as Segment scaled (eventually to the point of getting acquired by Twilio for $3.2 billion), Manohar and Curl teamed up with Curl\u2019s friend Gupta, a machine learning specialist, to strike out on their own to build Hightouch.\n\nHightouch has focused on developing tools in two main areas.\n\nThe first is its core customer data platform (CDP) product. Designed both for non-technical users as well as data scientists, Hightouch\u2019s CDP was a bit of a breakthrough when it launched in 2020 because of how it shifted away from looking at data in apps and focused on using machine learning and other tooling to make it easier to use data from data warehouses in marketing, sales, and customer service work.\n\n\u201cThey realized that cloud data warehouses are the new customer data platforms,\u201d Rajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, said in an interview. (He is joining the board with this round.)\n\nUses include building personalization campaigns, loyalty programs, syncing data from data warehouses to a wide range of tools (more than 250, the company says, including all the big CRM and marketing platforms), and more. As we\u2019ve described previously, users can create SQL queries to send data from data warehouses to different apps for specific uses, and there is a graphical interface for non-technical people to create queries.\n\nHightouch\u2019s second product is a newer offering, AI Decisioning, which goes deeper into machine learning and automation to do what the name says: It is an agentic AI product that can be prompted with a particular goal, which then runs multiple experiments and tests to suggest optimal campaigns.\n\nAI Decisioning has been around since August 2024. But while Hightouch was not looking to raise money before \u2014 it\u2019s \u201ccapital efficient\u201d as investors like to say, with money in the bank \u2014 customer interest in the AI product is what led the company to put together this Series C.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what motivated us to say, \u2018All right, let\u2019s have this conversation, and let\u2019s raise the round,\u2019\u201d said Gupta, \u201cbecause now we finally have a good use for capital.\u201d\n\nManohar admitted take-up of the AI product was helped by it getting rolled out to all of its existing customers \u2014 which include companies like Spotify, PetSmart, Tripadvisor, Grammarly, and more. But such is the juggernaut of AI right now that Hightouch found it was also picking up new business as a result of AI Decisioning.\n\nWhile \u201cdo things faster\u201d has long been one strong use case for adopting AI, as Manohar describes it, motivations are maturing.\n\n\u201cCompanies, at the CEO and chief digital officer and chief marketing officer level, are really interested in like, how do we use AI to give our customers a better experience and increase lifetime value and revenue across our customer base?\u201d he said. The AI Decisioning agents can \u201crun thousands of experiments to figure out the best experience to deliver,\u201d Manohar added.\n\nHightouch\u2019s previous fundraises include a seed round in 2020 from Y Combinator and others, a $40 million round led by ICONIQ Growth, and a $38 million round in 2023.",

                "text": "Monolinguists wanting to communicate with the global masses have never had it so easy. Trusty old Google Translate can convert the content of images, audio, and entire websites across hundreds of languages, while newer tools such as ChatGPT also serve as handy pocket translators.\n\nOn the back end, DeepL and ElevenLabs have have reached lofty billion-dollar valuations for various language-related smarts that businesses can funnel into their own applications. But a new player is now entering the fray, with an AI-powered localization engine that serves the infrastructure to help developers go global \u2014 a \u201cStripe\u201d for app localization, if you will.\n\nFormerly known as Replexica, Lingo.dev targets developers who want to make their app\u2019s front end fully localized from the get-go; all they need to worry about is shipping their code as usual, with Lingo.dev bubbling away under the hood on autopilot. The upshot is that there is no copy/pasting text between ChatGPT (for quick and dirty translations), or messing around with multiple translation files in different formats sourced from myriad agencies.\n\nToday, Lingo.dev counts customers such as French unicorn Mistral AI and open source Calendly rival Cal.com. To drive the next phase of growth, the company has announced it has raised $4.2 million in a seed round of funding led by Initialized Capital, with participation from Y Combinator and a slew of angels.\n\nFound in translation\n\nLingo.dev is the handiwork of CEO Max Prilutskiy and CPO Veronica Prilutskaya (pictured above) who announced that they sold a previous SaaS startup called Notionlytics to an undisclosed buyer last year. The duo had already been working on the foundations of Lingo.dev since 2023, with the first prototype developed as part of a hackathon at Cornell University. This led to their first paying customers, before going on to join Y Combinator\u2019s fall program last year.\n\nAt its core, Lingo-dev is a Translation API that can either be called locally by developers through their CLI (command line interface), or through a direct integration with their CI/CD system via GitHub or GitLab. So in essence, development teams receive pull requests with automated translation updates whenever a standard code change is made.\n\nAt the heart of all this, as you might expect, is a large language model (LLM) \u2014 or several LLMs, to be exact, with Lingo.dev orchestrating the various input and outputs between them all. This mix-and-match approach, which combines models from Anthropic and OpenAI, among other providers, is designed to ensure that the best model is chosen for the task at hand.\n\n\u201cDifferent prompts work better in some models over other models,\u201d Prilutskiy explained to TechCrunch. \u201cAlso depending on the use case, we might want better latency, or latency might not matter all.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about LLMs without also talking about data privacy \u2014 one of the reasons that some businesses have been slower to adopt generative AI. But with Lingo.dev, the focus is substantively on localizing front-end interfaces, though it also caters to business content such as marketing sites, automated emails, and more \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t funnel into any customers\u2019 personal identifiable information (PII), for instance.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect any personal data to be sent to us,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\n\nThrough Lingo.dev, companies can build translation memories (a store of previously translated content) and upload their style guide to tailor the brand voice for different markets.\n\nLingo.dev: Building a brand voice Image Credits:Lingo.dev\n\nBusinesses can also specify rules around how particular phrases should be handled and in what situations. Moreover, the engine can analyze the placement of specific text, making necessary adjustments along the way \u2014 for example, a word when translated from English into German might have double the number of characters, meaning that it would break the UI. Users can instruct the engine to circumvent that problem by rephrasing a piece of text so it matches the length of the original text.\n\nWithout the broader context of what an application actually is, it can be difficult to localize a small piece of standalone text, such as a label on an interface. Lingo.dev gets around this using a feature dubbed \u201ccontext awareness,\u201d whereby it analyzes the entire content of the localization file, including adjacent text or event system keys that translation files sometimes have. It\u2019s all about understanding the \u201cmicrocontext,\u201d as Prilutskiy puts it.\n\nAnd more is coming on this front in the future, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on a new feature that uses screenshots of the app\u2019s UI, which Lingo.dev would use to extract even more contextual hints about the UI elements and their intent,\u201d he said.\n\nLingo.dev dashboard Image Credits:Lingo.dev\n\nGoing local\n\nIt\u2019s still fairly early days for Lingo.dev in terms of its path to full localization. For example, colors and symbols may have different meanings between different cultures, something that Lingo.dev doesn\u2019t directly cater to. Moreover, things like metric/imperial conversions is something that still needs to be addressed by the developer at the code level.\n\nHowever, Lingo.dev does support the MessageFormat framework, which handles differences in pluralization and gender-specific phrasing between languages. The company also recently released an experimental beta feature specifically for idioms; for instance, \u201cto kill two birds with one stone\u201d has an equivalent in German that translates roughly into \u201cto hit two flies with one swat.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Lingo.dev is also carrying out applied AI research to improve various facets of the automated localization process.\n\n\u201cOne of the complex tasks we\u2019re currently working on is preserving feminine/masculine versions of nouns and verbs when translating between languages,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cDifferent languages encode different amounts of information. For example, the word \u2018teacher\u2019 in English is gender-neutral, but in Spanish it\u2019s either \u201cmaestro\u201d (male) or \u201cmaestra\u201d (female). Making sure these nuances are preserved correctly falls under our applied AI research efforts.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the game-plan is about much more than simple translation: It wants to get things as close as possible as to what you might get with a team of professional translators.\n\n\u201cOverall, the [goal] with Lingo.dev is to eliminate friction from localization so thoroughly, that it becomes an infrastructure layer and natural part of the tech stack,\u201d Prilutskiy said. \u201cSimilar to how Stripe eliminated friction from online payments so effectively that it became a core developer toolkit for payments.\u201d\n\nWhile the founders most recently were based in Barcelona, they\u2019re moving their formal home to San Francisco. The company counts just three employees total, with a founding engineer making up the trio \u2014 and this is a lean startup philosophy that they plan to follow.\n\n\u201cFolks at YC, myself and other founders, we\u2019re all huge believers in that,\u201d Prilutskiy said.\n\nTheir previous startup, which provided analytics for Notion, was entirely bootstrapped, with high-profile customers including Square, Shopify, and Sequoia Capital \u2014 and it had a grand total of zero employees beyond Max and Veronica.\n\n\u201cWe were two people, full time, but with some contractors for various things now and then,\u201d Prilutskiy added. \u201cBut we know how to build things with minimal resources. Because the previous company was bootstrapped, so we had to find a way for that to work. And we are replicating the same lean style \u2014 but now with funding.\u201d",

                "text": "Generative AI is getting better at interpreting dense texts, and this progress has proven to be a boon for startups attacking one of the most complex sets of texts there is: the law. It makes sense then that we\u2019ve been seeing a new burst of activity in the legal tech space off the back of advancements in AI in the last year or so.\n\nLegal tech startup Eudia bagged $105 million only last week; London-based Genie AI raised \u20ac16 million last year; U.S.-based Harvey landed a $300 million round led by Sequoia; and Lawhive raised $40 million to go after \u201cmain street\u201d U.S. lawyers. The latest addition to that list is Luminance, which is billing itself \u201clegal-grade\u201d AI.\n\nClaiming to be capable of highly accurate interrogation of legal issues and contracts, Luminance has raised $75 million in a Series C funding round led by Point72 Private Investments. The round is notable because it\u2019s one of the largest capital raises by a pure-play legal AI company in the U.K. and Europe. The company says it has raised over $115 million in the last 12 months, and $165 million in total.\n\nLuminance was originally developed by Cambridge-based academics Adam Guthrie (founder and chief technical architect) and Dr. Graham Sills (founder and director of AI). It was seed-funded by the late Dr. Mike Lynch, founder of Autonomy, who died in a tragic accident last year.\n\nLuminance uses what it calls a \u201cPanel of Judges\u201d AI system to automate and augment a business\u2019 approach to contracts \u2014 including generation, negotiation, and post-execution analysis. The startup uses a proprietary large language model (LLM) to power its main product, Lumi Go, which lets customers send draft agreements to a counterparty and have the AI auto-negotiate on their behalf.\n\nRather than using a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), Luminance uses what it describes as an LPT (legal pre-trained transformer) that\u2019s trained on over 150 million verified legal documents. Many of these documents are not publicly available, which, the company says, makes its platform relatively defensible. Other legal tech startups tend to build on existing general-purpose LLMs. \u201cIt\u2019s a domain-specialized AI that is built with lawyers in mind [\u2026] They need to understand that the outputs have been validated and can be trusted, and that\u2019s exactly what our specialized AI can achieve,\u201d said Eleanor Lightbody, the startup\u2019s CEO who took over from the founders after its Series A round.\n\nLightbody explained that the platform was built with the understanding that each model is good at different things. \u201cWhat you want is to have a mixed model approach, where the models can check each other\u2019s \u2018homework,\u2019 and you can get the most accurate and the most transparent answers,\u201d she said.\n\nShe claimed this approach sets Luminance apart from its competition as its clients can use its platform across the entire contract life cycle.\n\nLuminance currently has more than 700 clients across over 70 countries and includes names like AMD, Hitachi, LG Chem, SiriusXM, Rolls-Royce, and Lamborghini. Its headcount has tripled in North America after it opened three offices in San Francisco, Dallas, and Toronto, and expanded its U.S. headquarters in New York.\n\nThe Series C also saw participation from Forestay Capital, RPS Ventures, and Schroders Capital, as well as existing investors March Capital, National Grid Partners, and Slaughter and May.",

                "text": "Level Zero Health, a female-founded medical device startup that\u2019s aiming to break new ground by developing a device for continuous hormone monitoring, has closed an oversubscribed $6.9 million pre-seed funding round despite being only a little over a year old. The startup wants to do away with the need for invasive blood draws and support research which could lead to new treatments for conditions linked to hormone imbalances or even new healthcare innovations, such as individual dosing for hormone-based contraception.\n\n\u201cOne of our investors told us there are companies who build fundamental technologies and there are companies who build wrappers around that technology; you guys are creating new technology here,\u201d says co-founder and CEO Ula Rustamova, discussing the company\u2019s development since we last checked in with them last fall when they presented onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt as part of the Startup Battlefield competition.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to create a whole new market out of this, right? The same way CGMs [continuous glucose monitors] did. They literally, out of nothing, created a multibillion-dollar market,\u201d she goes on. \u201cThis is, by definition, a whole new product category of its own \u2014 that hopefully will inspire people to use the device and the data to create a lot of companies on top of that and have a ripple effect in the next few decades.\u201d\n\nStep by step\n\nBuilding a whole new product category of any stripe can take time. Factor in this being a hardware startup, and a medical device to boot, it\u2019s clear Level Zero Health isn\u2019t going to be able to serve up a paradigm shift in how hormones are monitored overnight.\n\nThis is why the team is also working on a stepping stone single-use product (pictured above in prototype form), which they hope to get cleared for prescription use next year \u2014 to support intermittent hormone testing associated with medical use cases such as fertility (IVF) and low testosterone (TRT).\n\nThe current prototype wearable contains tiny needles that allow it to take samples just under the skin to detect trace amounts of hormones.\n\nThis is a step toward the hormone monitoring wearable they ultimately hope to bring to market \u2014 tentatively slated for 2028 \u2014 that\u2019s able to pull a continuous measure of things like progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone from the wearer\u2019s interstitial fluid. (That is fluid that fills the spaces around cells, acting as an intermediary between blood plasma and cells \u2014 hence why biochemical compounds in the blood can also be detected in interstitial fluid.)\n\nA continuous hormone monitoring device \u2014 or, rather, the data it picks up \u2014 could play a transformative role in boosting scientific understanding of the roles hormones play in human biology \u2014 much like CGMs have transformed diabetes management (and more besides).\n\nBut Level Zero Health is also building a business \u2014 initially a B2B business, aiming to sell technology into healthcare provider networks \u2014 so the founders are working on twin product development tracks to shorten time-to-market and bridge the gap between the big bang mission and what\u2019s currently possible.\n\n\u201cWe think that we have this source of truth that we can tap into \u2014 which is interstitial fluid,\u201d Rustamova tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we think that there\u2019s an immediate, shorter-term product here that we should launch first.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that continuous [hormone monitoring] \u2026 is the holy grail \u2014 that is the future \u2014 because it makes sense, in a way because it\u2019s again frictionless, you can put it on, and you can sort of get really consistent measurements. But also we understand that, today, we need to enter the market in a way where we would not try to change the protocol \u2014 and not have a seven-year research question of \u2018let\u2019s try and interpret this data\u2019 \u2014 so our first device is actually similar to finger stick devices, but it\u2019s also a patch.\u201d\n\nThe prototype wearable is able to take measurements throughout the day when worn \u2014 extracting a series of data points with the goal of \u201cdelivering value immediately\u201d for use cases such as IVF, where a woman might otherwise need to have multiple blood draws to monitor hormone levels.\n\nRustamova says the team hopes to have concluded clinical trials and secured clearance for this single-use intermittent monitoring patch next year \u2014 with eyes on obtaining approval both from the U.S. regulator, the FDA, and a CE marking to allow them to sell into European healthcare markets (she says they\u2019re not sure which may come first).\n\n\u201cHopefully, this year we want to show some level of correlation [between levels of hormones the wearable patch can detect and levels detected via a blood draw] \u2014 that\u2019s the promise I want to deliver with the pre-seed money,\u201d she adds.\n\nCTO and co-founder Irene Jia tells us the team\u2019s goal is to be able to demonstrate a 90%+ correlation with what their patch can pick up compared to measuring hormone levels via a blood draw.\n\nRisk vs. reward\n\nAlthough later on \u2014 when we\u2019re discussing the delay between blood-based readings and detection via interstitial fluid \u2014 Rustamova chimes in to underscore the difference in medical risk between CGMs and hormone monitoring. She points out that the risk for someone with diabetes (i.e., if blood glucose readings are delayed or off) is likely to be extremely high, whereas hormone monitoring is typically not that high stakes.\n\n\u201cFor glucose, you have potential lethal consequences of giving a wrong reading or having that delay\u2026 [but when it comes to hormone monitoring] the risk of having a slight deviation or sort of correlation not being as tight,\u201d she tells us. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re going to try and correlate as much as possible \u2014 but \u2026 there\u2019s this very different risk profile here.\u201d She also noted that the first CGMs to market had a lower correlation with blood readings than these devices now do.\n\nThe suggestion is the team\u2019s goal is to keep raising the bar on accuracy. Which \u2014 perhaps \u2014 hints at the reason investors have been keen to pile into this medtech startup\u2019s early round \u2014 with the potential rewards versus risks being skewed in a positive direction.\n\nThe other \u2014 doubtless \u2014 helpful factor here is that Level Zero Health isn\u2019t solely focused on women\u2019s health issues; monitoring male hormones is a core piece of the initial business plan. (And it remains the case that most tech investors are still men placing bets on solving problems that speak to their interests.)\n\nLevel Zero Health\u2019s pre-seed funding round was led by European VC Redalpine. HAX (SOSV), Entrepreneur First (EF), and industry experts also contributed to the round \u2014 with SOSV having previously accepted the startup onto its deeptech/hardware HAX accelerator program, and Rustamova also being an EF alum.\n\nCommenting in a statement, Philip Kneis, investor at Redalpine and a Level Zero Health board member, said: \u201cWe did it for blood pressure and will do it again for hormones. Continuous hormone measurement is one of the holy grails of diagnostics, and as fundamental science transitions to engineering, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to back Level Zero Health in their mission to transform hormone tracking with their novel biosensor \u2014 paving the way for a new era of personalized health management.\u201d",

                "text": "As gaming platforms like Roblox and Minecraft continue to grow in popularity among young children, and with platforms like YouTube consuming hours of their daily screen time, edtech companies face challenges in capturing their attention.\n\nPolymath aims to tackle this by combining gamified mechanics inspired by these popular games with adaptive math lessons to make the learning experience more enjoyable.\n\nThe educational sandbox game allows children to explore a virtual island where they can customize avatars, build using bricks and other materials, and interact with villagers. To progress in the game, kids must complete math-related questions, which ensures they remain focused on their educational goals.\n\nThe startup announced on Monday its $1 million pre-seed funding round, which will help its platform reach additional markets. The raise was co-led by Blackbird Ventures and GD1. Notably, Liam Don, ClassDojo\u2019s chief technology officer, is an angel investor.\n\nImage Credits:Screenshot of Polymath platform by TechCrunch\n\nSophie Silver, co-founder and CEO of Polymath, studied human learning, memory, and developmental psychology at University College London (UCL). While working as a part-time nanny during her studies, she noticed a gap in children\u2019s mathematical abilities and realized it was becoming increasingly difficult to make lessons entertaining for them.\n\n\u201cThe kids really did not enjoy maths, and so I would start to invent games, mainly with cards or dice, to try and motivate them to do their multiplication or whatever they needed to do,\u201d Sophie Silver told TechCrunch. \u201c[I realized] the way that these kids are learning is not aligned with how the brain works.\u201d\n\nPolymath uses an adaptive algorithm to personalize learning for each child based on their progress. The company analyzes children\u2019s answers to identify the best question to ask next, recognizes knowledge gaps, and optimizes the timing of new information to prevent the kid from being overwhelmed.\n\nIn addition to the core math lesson feature, there are learning opportunities inside the virtual world. For instance, if players want to build a house in the game, they need to measure the dimensions and calculate how many wood blocks they need.\n\nImage Credits:Polymath\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shopkeeper where you can buy things like resources from it, and sometimes that shopkeeper is unreliable and will give you the wrong price. Each block of wood costs 5 \u201ccubos\u201d (the currency in Polymath). You\u2019re asking to buy 4, but it\u2019s trying to charge you 30 cubos. That\u2019s a critical thinking moment for the student to recognize that the price is wrong,\u201d Christian Silver, co-founder and CTO, said.\n\nPolymath offers both an at-home version and a classroom version. The classroom version allows teachers to monitor students in real time. In this version, all players can work together in a shared space, answering questions simultaneously. If the classroom doesn\u2019t have enough devices available, Polymath has an option that calls on players to answer the next question, so every student is involved.\n\nThe at-home version enables parents to manage their child\u2019s experience and receive weekly email reports about their child\u2019s progress. There is also a parent app, Polymath Relate, where parents can view detailed answers to every question their child has answered.\n\nAdditionally, kids can connect with a friend on Polymath using a unique friend code. However, when playing in multiplayer mode, no chat function is available.\n\nPolymath launched in January 2023 through the Startmate accelerator in New Zealand. It has garnered thousands of users across Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, and Virginia, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.\n\nFuture plans for the game include expanding the curriculum to offer more advanced learning opportunities and allowing for collaborative play, where kids can work together on problems. Additionally, Polymath plans to introduce purchasable avatar assets as a revenue stream in the future.\n\nPolymath is free to play on the web, iOS, and Android devices.",

Scheduled to take place in Isla Mujeres, Mexico from May 30 to June 2, tickets just went on sale, ranging from $1,400 to a truly brazen $1.1 million \u2014 even though no artists have been confirmed, and McFarland himself isn\u2019t sure if he can legally leave the country to attend, as he told the Today show Monday morning.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly unexpected. Back in 2017, McFarland masterminded a wildly successful viral campaign for Fyre Festival, promising an ultra-luxurious music event in the Bahamas. Influencers flocked to promote it, but when guests arrived, they found FEMA tents, sad cheese sandwiches, and no running water. The debacle became a defining moment of influencer culture gone wrong, immortalized on Instagram. (Lost in the mayhem was Fyre Festival\u2019s original purpose: to promote Fyre Media, McFarland\u2019s \u201cUber for the performing arts,\u201d a platform connecting event organizers with musicians.)\n\nMcFarland\u2019s ineptitude landed him in prison for fraud, and while the terms of his 2022 release could prevent him from traveling internationally, don\u2019t be shocked if people again buy what he\u2019s selling.

Now, Beeper is releasing the first set of redesigned apps for iOS and desktop in beta after the merger.\n\nIn a blog post, Beeper said that it built the desktop app using Texts.com app\u2019s foundation, and the iOS app from scratch. The company added that the new set of apps are faster and less battery hungry.\n\nOn X, Texts.com founder Kishan Bagaria said that while users can still use the old app, eventually the company will provide an easy way to migrate to the new set of apps.\n\nCurrently, the app uses Beeper Cloud to store messages and credentials for other services. In upcoming versions, all this data will be stored on-device. What\u2019s more, the new apps will have on-device encryption for better privacy and security, and support multiple accounts associated with the same messaging service. Bagaria also mentioned that down the line, the Mac app will allow users to send and receive iMessages.\n\nBeeper was founded by Eric Migicovsky, who was the founder of the Pebble smartwatch and a partner at Y-Combinator. After the acquisition, Migicovsky became the outfit\u2019s head of messaging. However, last month Migicovsky announced that he is focused on building Pebble again.",

                "text": "The U.K. government is pushing forward with plans to attract more AI companies to the region by changing copyright law. The proposed changes would allow developers to train AI models on artists\u2019 content found online \u2014 without permission or payment \u2014 unless creators proactively \u201copt out.\u201d Not everyone is marching to the same beat, though.\n\nOn Monday, a group of 1,000 musicians released a \u201csilent album,\u201d protesting the planned changes. The album \u2014 titled \u201cIs This What We Want?\u201d \u2014 features tracks from Kate Bush, Imogen Heap, and contemporary classical composers Max Richter and Thomas Hewitt Jones, among others. It also features co-writing credits from hundreds more, including big names like Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn, Billy Ocean, The Clash, Mystery Jets, Yusuf / Cat Stevens, Riz Ahmed, Tori Amos, and Hans Zimmer.\n\nBut this is not Band Aid part 2. And it\u2019s not a collection of music. Instead, the artists have put together recordings of empty studios and performance spaces \u2014 a symbolic representation of what they believe will be the impact of the planned copyright law changes.\n\n\u201cYou can hear my cats moving around,\u201d is how Hewitt Jones described his contribution to the album. \u201cI have two cats in my studio who bother me all day when I\u2019m working.\u201d\n\nTo put an even more blunt point on it, the titles of the 12 tracks that make up the album spell out a message: \u201cThe British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.\u201d\n\nThe album is just the latest move in the U.K. to bring attention to the issue of how copyright is being handled in AI training. Similar protests are underway in other markets, like the U.S., highlighting a global concern among artists.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, who organized the project, has simultaneously been leading a bigger campaign against AI training without licensing. A petition he started has now been signed by more than 47,000 writers, visual artists, actors, and others in the creative industries, with nearly 10,000 of them signing up in just the last five weeks since the U.K. government announced its big AI strategy.\n\nNewton-Rex said he has also been \u201crunning a nonprofit in AI for the last year where we\u2019ve been certifying companies that basically don\u2019t scrape and train on great work without permission.\u201d\n\nNewton-Rex arrived at advocating for artists after having batted for both sides. Classically trained as a composer, he later built an AI-based music composition platform called Jukedeck that let people bypass using copyrighted works by creating their own. Its catchy pitch, where he rapped and riffed on the virtues of using AI to write music, won the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition in 2015. Jukedeck was eventually acquired by TikTok, where he worked for some time on music services.\n\nAfter several years at other tech companies like Snap and Stability, Newton-Rex is back to considering how to build the future without burning the past. He\u2019s contemplating that idea from a pretty interesting vantage point: He now lives in the Bay Area with wife Alice Newton-Rex, VP of product at WhatsApp.\n\nThe album release comes just ahead of the planned changes to copyright law in the U.K, which would force artists who do not want their work used for AI training purposes to proactively \u201copt out.\u201d\n\nNewton-Rex thinks this effectively creates a lose-lose situation for artists since there is no opt-out method in place, or any clear way of being able to track what specific material has been fed into any AI system.\n\n\u201cWe know that opt-out schemes are just not taken up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just going to give 90% [to] 95% of people\u2019s work to AI companies. That\u2019s without a doubt.\u201d\n\nThe solution, say the artists, is to produce work in other markets where there might be better protections for it. Hewitt Jones \u2014 who threw a working keyboard into a harbor in Kent at an in-person protest not long ago (he fished it out, broken, afterwards) \u2014 said he\u2019s considering markets like Switzerland for distributing his music in the future.\n\nBut the rock and hard place of a harbor in Kent are nothing compared to the Wild West of the internet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told for decades to share our work online because it\u2019s good for exposure. But now AI companies and, incredibly, governments are turning around and saying, \u2018Well, you put that online for free \u2026\u201d Newton-Rex said. \u201cSo now artists are just stopping making and sharing their work. A number of artists have contacted me to say this is what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe album will be posted widely on music platforms sometime Tuesday, the organizers said, and any donations or proceeds from playing it will go to the charity Help Musicians.",

                "text": "Ofcom, the U.K.\u2019s internet safety regulator, has published another new draft guidance as it continues to implement the Online Safety Act (OSA) \u2014 the latest set of recommendations aim to support in-scope firms to meet legal obligations to protect women and girls from online threats like harassment and bullying, misogyny, and intimate image abuse.\n\nThe government has said that protecting women and girls is a priority for its implementation of the OSA. Certain forms of (predominantly) misogynist abuse \u2014 such as sharing intimate images without consent or using AI tools to create deepfake porn that targets individuals \u2014 are explicitly set out in the law as enforcement priorities.\n\nThe online safety regulation, which was approved by the U.K. parliament back in September 2023, has faced criticism that it\u2019s not up to the task of reforming platform giants, despite containing substantial penalties for non-compliance \u2014 up to 10% of global annual turnover.\n\nChild safety campaigners have also expressed frustration over how long it\u2019s taking to implement the law, as well as doubting whether it will have the desired effect.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC in January, even the technology minister Peter Kyle \u2014 who inherited the legislation from the previous government \u2014 called it \u201cvery uneven\u201d and \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d But the government is sticking with the approach. Part of the discontent around the OSA can be traced back to the long lead time ministers allowed for implementing the regime, which requires parliament to approve Ofcom compliance guidance.\n\nHowever, enforcement is expected to start to kick in soon in relation to core requirements on tackling illegal content and child protection. Other aspects of OSA compliance will take longer to implement. And Ofcom concedes this latest package of practice recommendations won\u2019t become fully enforceable until 2027 or later.\n\nApproaching the enforcement start line\n\n\u201cThe first duties of the Online Safety Act are coming into force next month,\u201d Ofcom\u2019s Jessica Smith, who led development of the female safety-focused guidance, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cSo we will be enforcing against some of the core duties of the Online Safety Act ahead of this guidance [itself becoming enforceable].\u201d\n\nThe new draft guidance on keeping women and girls safe online is intended to supplement earlier broader Ofcom guidance on illegal content \u2014 which also, for example, provides recommendations for protecting minors from seeing adult content online.\n\nIn December, the regulator published its finalized guidance on how platforms and services should shrink risks related to illegal content, an area where child protection is a clear priority.\n\nIt has also previously produced a Children\u2019s Safety Code, which recommends online services dial up age checks and content filtering to ensure kids are not exposed to inappropriate content such as pornography. And as it\u2019s worked toward implementing the online safety regime, it\u2019s also developed recommendations for age assurance technologies for adult content websites, with the aim of pushing porn sites to take effective steps preventing minors from accessing age-inappropriate content.\n\nThe latest set of guidance was developed with help from victims, survivors, women\u2019s advocacy groups, and safety experts, per Ofcom. It covers four major areas where the regulator says females are disproportionately affected by online harm \u2014 namely: online misogyny; pile-ons and online harassment; online domestic abuse; and intimate image abuse.\n\nSafety by design\n\nOfcom\u2019s top-line recommendation urges in-scope services and platforms to take a \u201csafety by design\u201d approach. Smith told us the regulator wants to encourage tech firms to \u201ctake a step back\u201d and \u201cthink about their user experience in the round.\u201d While she acknowledged some services have put in place some measures that are helpful in shrinking online risks in this area, she argued there\u2019s still a lack of holistic thinking when it comes to prioritizing the safety of women and girls.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really asking for is just a sort of step change in how the design processes work,\u201d she told us, saying the goal is to ensure that safety considerations are baked into product design.\n\nShe highlighted the rise of image generating AI services, which she noted have led to \u201cmassive\u201d growth in deepfake intimate image abuse as an example of where technologists could have taken proactive measures to crimp the risks of their tools being weaponized to target women and girls \u2014 yet did not.\n\n\u201cWe think that there are sensible things that services could do at the design phase which would help to address the risk of some of those harms,\u201d she suggested.\n\nExamples of \u201cgood\u201d industry practices Ofcom highlights in the guidance includes online services taking actions such as:\n\nRemoving geolocation by default (to shrink privacy/stalking risks);\n\nConducting \u201cabusability\u201d testing to identify how a service could be weaponized/misused;\n\nTaking steps to boost account security;\n\nDesigning in user prompts that are intended to make posters think twice before posting abusive content;\n\nAnd offering accessible reporting tools that let users report issues.\n\nAs is the case with all Ofcom\u2019s OSA guidance, not every measure will be relevant for every type or size of service \u2014 since the law applies to online services large and small, and cuts across various arenas, from social media, to online dating, gaming, forums and messaging apps, to name a few. So a big part of the work for in-scope companies will be understanding what compliance means in the context of their product.\n\nWhen asked if Ofcom had identified any services currently meeting the guidance\u2019s standards, Smith suggested they had not. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to do across the industry,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also tacitly acknowledged that there may be growing challenges given some of the retrograde steps taken vis-\u00e0-vis trust and safety by some major industry players. For example, since taking over Twitter and rebranding the social network as X, Elon Musk has gutted its trust and safety headcount \u2014 in favor of pursuing what he has framed as a maximalist approach to free speech.\n\nIn recent months, Meta \u2014 which owns Facebook and Instagram \u2014 appears to have taken some mimicking steps, saying it\u2019s ending thirty-party fact-checking contracts in favor of deploying an X-style \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system of crowdsourced labeling on content disputes, for example.\n\nTransparency\n\nSmith suggested that Ofcom\u2019s response to such high-level shifts \u2014 where operators\u2019 actions could risk dialing up, rather than damping down, online harms \u2014 will focus on using transparency and information-gathering powers it wields under the OSA to illustrate impacts and drive user awareness.\n\nSo, in short, the tactic here looks set to be \u201cname and shame\u201d \u2014 at least in the first instance.\n\n\u201cOnce we finalize the guidance, we will produce a [market] report \u2026 about who is using the guidance, who is following what steps, what kind of outcomes they\u2019re achieving for their users who are women and girls, and really shine a light on what protections are in place on different platforms so that users can make informed choices about where they spend their time online,\u201d she told us.\n\nSmith suggested that companies wanting to avoid the risk of being publicly shamed for poor performance on women\u2019s safety will be able to turn to Ofcom\u2019s guidance for \u201cpractical steps\u201d on how to improve the situation for their users, and address the risk of reputational harm too.\n\n\u201cPlatforms that are operating in the U.K. will have to comply with the U.K. law,\u201d she added in the context of the discussion on major platforms de-emphasizing trust and safety. \u201cSo that means complying with the illegal harms duties and the protection of children duties under the Online Safety Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is where our transparency powers also come in \u2014 if the industry is changing direction and harms are increasing, this is where we will be able to shine a light and share relevant information with U.K. users, with media, with parliamentarians.\u201d\n\nTech to tackle deepfake porn\n\nOne type of online harm where Ofcom is explicitly beefing up its recommendations even before it\u2019s actively started OSA enforcement is intimate image abuse \u2014 as the latest draft guidance suggests the use hash matching to detect and remove such abusive imagery, whereas earlier Ofcom recommendations did not go that far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve included additional steps in this guidance that go beyond what we\u2019ve already set out in our codes,\u201d Smith noted, confirming Ofcom plans to update its earlier codes to incorporate this change \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is a way of saying to platforms that you can get ahead of that enforceable requirement by following the steps that are set down in this guidance,\u201d she added.\n\nOfcom recommended the use of hash matching technology to counter intimate image abuse due to a substantial increase in this risk, per Smith \u2014 especially in relation to AI-generated deepfake image abuse.\n\n\u201cThere was more deepfake intimate image abuse reported in 2023 than in all previous years combined,\u201d she noted, adding that Ofcom has also gathered more evidence on the effectiveness of hash matching to tackle this harm.\n\nThe draft guidance as a whole will now undergo consultation \u2014 with Ofcom inviting feedback until May 23, 2025 \u2014 after which it will produce final guidance by the end of this year.\n\nA full 18 months after that, Ofcom will then produce its first report reviewing industry practice in this area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting into 2027 before we\u2019re producing our first report on who\u2019s doing what [to protect women and girls online] \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing to stop platforms acting now,\u201d she added.\n\nResponding to criticism that the OSA is taking Ofcom too long to implement, she said it\u2019s right that the regulator consults on compliance measures. However, with the final measure taking effect next month, she noted that Ofcom anticipates a shift in the conversation surrounding the issue, too.\n\n\u201c[T]hat will really start to change the conversation with platforms, in particular,\u201d she predicted, adding that it will also be in a position to start demonstrating progress on moving the needle when it comes to reducing online harms.",

                "text": "In a bold move last month, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post, telling President Trump that \u201cAmerica must win the AI war.\u201d\n\nThe statement sparked mixed reactions, as seen during Wang\u2019s appearance Sunday during the opening night of Web Summit Qatar. When Wang\u2019s interviewer, Axios\u2019 Felix Salmon, polled the room, asking how many people agreed with that opinion, he counted just two hands. When he asked the room how many disagreed, Salmon noted an \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of hands went up.\n\nSo Salmon asked Wang to defend his opinion. \u201cAI is going to fundamentally change the nature of national security,\u201d Wang explained. He noted that he grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico \u201cthe birthplace of the atomic bomb\u201d and that both of his parents were physicists who worked at the National Lab.\n\nWang said he views this as a race between the U.S. and China. And he expressed concern that AI will allow China to \u201cleapfrog\u201d the military might of \u201cWestern powers,\u201d which is what prompted the full-page ad.\n\nWang was echoing language that\u2019s increasingly coming from defense tech startups and VCs. They are pushing for more autonomy in AI weapons and more AI weapons generally. They point to China, hypothesizing a situation where China releases fully autonomous AI weapons, while the U.S. is slowed by requiring a human decision-maker in the loop before firing.\n\nBeyond the hypothetical weapons of another nation, Wang tried to make the case for choosing between China and the U.S. for baseline LLM models. He believes this will also be a two-horse race, not mentioning other players like France\u2019s Mistral. He argued that U.S. models bake in free speech where Chinese models reflect communist society viewpoints.\n\nIt\u2019s true that researchers have discovered that many popular Chinese LLM models have their government\u2019s censorship baked in. And concerns over Chinese government backdoors for data gathering plague the Chinese models as well.\n\nWang\u2019s stated concerns about government influence in AI seemed especially timely as his talk coincided with Scale announcing an agreement with the Qatar government. Announced on Sunday, Wang said Scale will help Qatar build out 50 AI-powered government apps, ranging from education to healthcare.\n\nScale is mostly known for employing legions of contract workers, often overseas from the U.S., to manually help train models. It works with Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta, most of the major U.S. foundational models. It also offers other products, like an AI data engine and AI apps, some designed for the defense industry.\n\nThe overt pro-American language likely serves Scale AI well with its DoD customers. But the Web Summit talk also showcased how many people seem equally uncomfortable with the U.S. having AI superpowers, too.",

                "text": "In late January, a warning spread through the London-based Facebook group Are We Dating the Same Guy?\u2014but this post wasn\u2019t about a bad date or a cheating ex. A connected network of male-dominated Telegram groups had surfaced, sharing and circulating nonconsensual intimate images of women. Their justification? Retaliation.\n\nOn January 23, users in the AWDTSG Facebook group began warning about hidden Telegram groups. Screenshots and TikTok videos surfaced, revealing public Telegram channels where users were sharing nonconsensual intimate images. Further investigation by WIRED identified additional channels linked to the network. By scraping thousands of messages from these groups, it became possible to analyze their content and the patterns of abuse.\n\nAWDTSG, a sprawling web of over 150 regional forums across Facebook alone, with roughly 3 million members worldwide, was designed by Paolo Sanchez in 2022 in New York as a space for women to share warnings about predatory men. But its rapid growth made it a target. Critics argue that the format allows unverified accusations to spiral. Some men have responded with at least three defamation lawsuits filed in recent years against members, administrators, and even Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company. Others took a different route: organized digital harassment.\n\nPrimarily using Telegram group data made available through Telemetr.io, a Telegram analytics tool, WIRED analyzed more than 3,500 messages from a Telegram group linked to a larger misogynistic revenge network. Over 24 hours, WIRED observed users systematically tracking, doxing, and degrading women from AWDTSG, circulating nonconsensual images, phone numbers, usernames, and location data.\n\nFrom January 26 to 27, the chats became a breeding ground for misogynistic, racist, sexual digital abuse of women, with women of color bearing the brunt of the targeted harassment and abuse. Thousands of users encouraged each other to share nonconsensual intimate images, often referred to as \u201crevenge porn,\u201d and requested and circulated women\u2019s phone numbers, usernames, locations, and other personal identifiers.\n\nAs women from AWDTSG began infiltrating the Telegram group, at least one user grew suspicious: \u201cThese lot just tryna get back at us for exposing them.\u201d\n\nWhen women on Facebook tried to alert others of the risk of doxing and leaks of their intimate content, AWDTSG moderators removed their posts. (The group\u2019s moderators did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Meanwhile, men who had previously coordinated through their own Facebook groups like \u201cAre We Dating the Same Girl\u201d shifted their operations in late January to Telegram's more permissive environment. Their message was clear: If they can do it, so can we.\n\n\"In the eyes of some of these men, this is a necessary act of defense against a kind of hostile feminism that they believe is out to ruin their lives,\" says Carl Miller, cofounder of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media and host of the podcast Kill List.\n\nThe dozen Telegram groups that WIRED has identified are part of a broader digital ecosystem often referred to as the manosphere, an online network of forums, influencers, and communities that perpetuate misogynistic ideologies.",

                "text": "As the so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to rampage through the United States government by making sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, numerous ongoing lawsuits allege that the group\u2019s access to sensitive data violates the Watergate-inspired Privacy Act of 1974 and that it needs to halt its activity. Meanwhile, DOGE cut staff this week at the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and gained access to CISA\u2019s digital systems after the agency had already frozen its eight-year-old election security initiatives late last week.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology was also bracing this week for roughly 500 staffers to be fired, which could have serious impacts on NIST\u2019s cybersecurity standards and software vulnerability tracking work. And cuts last week at the US Digital Service included the cybersecurity lead for the central Veterans Affairs portal, VA.gov, potentially leaving VA systems and data more vulnerable without someone in his role.\n\nMultiple US government departments are now considering bans on China-made TP-Link routers following recent aggressive Chinese digital espionage campaigns. (The company denies any connection to cyberattacks.) A WIRED investigation found that users of Google\u2019s ad tech can target categories that shouldn\u2019t be available under the company\u2019s policies, including people with chronic diseases or those in debt. Advertisers could also target national security \u201cdecision makers\u201d and people involved in the development of classified defense technology.\n\nGoogle researchers warned this week that hackers tied to Russia have been tricking Ukrainian soldiers with fake QR codes for Signal group invites that exploited a flaw to allow the attackers to spy on target messages. Signal has rolled out updates to stop exploitation. And a WIRED deep dive examines how difficult it can be for even the most connected web users to have nonconsensual intimate images and videos of themselves removed from the web.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nRunning a cryptocurrency exchange is a risky business, as hacking victims like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, FTX, and plenty of others can attest. But never before has a platform for buying and selling crypto lost a 10-figure dollar sum in a single heist. That new record belongs to ByBit, which on Friday revealed that thieves hacked its Ethereum-based holdings. The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic\u2014the largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.\n\nByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a \u201cmusked transaction\u201d\u2014likely a misspelling of \u201cmasked transaction\u201d\u2014to trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. \u201cPlease rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,\u201d Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. \u201cAll withdraws are NORMAL.\u201d Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.\n\nThe theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit\u2019s $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.\n\nThe British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users\u2019 end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple\u2019s Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it\u2014not even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK\u2019s pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" the company said. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move\u2014and the UK\u2019s push for it\u2014will weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.\n\nThe only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps\u2014malware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim\u2019s movements and communications\u2014is when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims\u2019 information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware\u2019s registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.",

                "text": "TP-Link is one of the most popular router manufacturers in the US, but the company is facing a potential ban due to security concerns about its links to China. A December report from The Wall Street Journal revealed that the US Commerce, Defense, and Justice Departments are investigating TP-Link, though no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing has yet emerged.\n\n\u201cWe are a US company,\u201d Jeff Barney, president of TP-Link told WIRED, \u201cWe have no affiliation with TP-Link Tech, which focuses on mainland China, and we can prove our separateness.\u201d\n\nThe investigation was sparked by a letter from John Moolenaar, a Republican for Michigan, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat of Illinois. Both are on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. They outlined concerns that Chinese state-sponsored hackers may be able to compromise TP-Link\u2019s routers more easily than other brands and thereby infiltrate US systems, and that TP-Link is subject to Chinese law, meaning it can be forced to hand over sensitive US information by Chinese intelligence officials.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nTP-Link was founded in China in 1996 by two brothers, and TP-Link USA was established in 2008. It wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the Chinese and US wings began to split. The process of moving the 170 subsidiaries and all the related ownership out of Hong Kong and into the United States was delayed by the pandemic, says Barney, but it was divested and restructured by 2024.\n\nTP-Link now has headquarters in California, a branch in Singapore, and manufactures in Vietnam. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures everything except chipsets in-house, according to Barney. \u201cOur entities in China are governed directly by us, our employees badged by us, secured by us, in our own facilities.\u201d He also says TP-Link has shared documentation with investigators and that its factory in Vietnam was audited by US retail partners like Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a Nexus in China,\u201d Barney says. He claims that American rival Netgear uses Chinese ODMs (original device manufacturers) to build its products and that even Apple relies on manufacturing in China. Netgear says its routers are manufactured in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand, not China.\n\nCompetition Concerns\n\nThe WSJ report suggests that TP-Link has a leading 64.9 percent share of the US router market, but TP-Link disputes this. The company claims its share hovered around 20 percent for the last few years, but jumped to a 36.5 percent unit share and a 30.7 percent dollar share in 2024, according to Circana data. But even TP-Link\u2019s lower estimate shows a company in the ascendancy. This dominance has been driven by aggressively low prices and a relatively early roll-out of Wi-Fi 7 routers, perceived by some as a concerted effort to flood the US market.\n\n\u201cTechnology should not be exorbitant,\u201d Barney says. \u201cWe're trying to democratize these products.\u201d\n\nHowever, the wide product range raises questions, with many wondering how TP-Link can profit from routers sold at such low prices compared to the competition. Former CNET reviewer Dong Ngo explores this point on the in-depth router review website, Dong Knows.",

The fears were heightened last week when some NIST workers witnessed a handful of people they believed to be associated with DOGE inside Building 225, which houses the NIST Information Technology Laboratory at the agency\u2019s Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, according to multiple people briefed on the sightings. The DOGE staff were seeking access to NIST\u2019s IT systems, one of the people said.\n\nSoon after the purported visit, NIST leadership told employees that DOGE staffers were not currently on campus, but that office space and technology were being provisioned for them, according to the same people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Axios and Bloomberg reported that NIST had begun informing some employees that they could soon be laid off. About 500 recent hires who are still in probationary status and can be let go more easily were among those expected to be affected, according to the reports. Three sources tell WIRED that the cuts likely impact lauded technical experts in leadership positions, including three lab directors who were promoted within the last year. One person familiar with the agency tells WIRED that the official layoff notices may come Friday.\n\nThe White House and a spokesperson for NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce, did not yet return requests for comment.\n\nOne NIST team that has been fearing cuts because of its number of probationary employees is the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created after former President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI issued in October 2023. Trump rescinded the order shortly after taking office last month, describing it as a \u201cbarrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe AI Safety Institute and its roughly two dozen staffers have been working closely with AI companies, including rivals to Musk\u2019s startup xAI like OpenAI and Anthropic, to understand and test the capabilities of their most powerful models. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI and is currently suing the startup over its decision to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.\n\nAISI\u2019s inaugural director, Elizabeth Kelly, announced she was leaving her role earlier this month. Several other high-profile NIST leaders working on AI have also departed in recent weeks, including Reva Schwartz, who led NIST\u2019s Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI program, and Elham Tabassi, NIST\u2019s chief AI adviser. Kelly and Schwartz declined to comment. Tabassi did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at wak.01, peard33.24, and leahfeiger.86.\n\nUS vice president JD Vance recently signaled the new administration\u2019s intent to deprioritize AI safety at the AI Action Summit, a major international meeting held in Paris last week that AISI and other government staffers were not invited to attend, according to three familiar with the matter. \u201cI'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,\u201d Vance said in his first major speech as VP. \u201cI'm here to talk about AI opportunity.\u201d",

                "text": "For more than a decade now, Russian cyberwarfare has used Ukraine as a test lab for its latest hacking techniques, methods that often target Ukrainians first before they're deployed more broadly. Now Google is warning of a Russian espionage trick that's been used to obtain Ukrainians' messages on the encrypted platform Signal\u2014and one that both Ukrainians and other Signal users worldwide should protect themselves against with a new update to the app.\n\nGoogle's threat intelligence team on Wednesday released a report revealing how multiple hacker groups that serve Russian state interests are targeting Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging tool that has become widely accepted as a standard for private communications and is now often used by Ukrainians, including in the Ukrainian military's battlefield communications. Those Russia-linked groups, which Google has given the working names UNC5792 and UNC4221, are taking advantage of a Signal feature that allows users to join a Signal group by scanning a QR code from their phone. By sending phishing messages to victims, often over Signal itself, both hacker groups have spoofed those group invites in the form of QR codes that instead hide javascript commands that link the victim's phone to a new device\u2014in this case, one in the hands of an eavesdropper who can then read every message the target sends or receives.\n\n\u201cIt looks exactly like a group invite, and everything would function exactly like that, except when you scan it, it links the device out,\u201d says Dan Black, a Google cyberespionage researcher and former NATO analyst. \u201cIt instantly pairs your device with theirs. And all your messages are now, in real time, being delivered over to the threat actor while you're receiving them.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, Google began warning the Signal Foundation that maintains the private communications platform about Russia's use of the QR code phishing technique, and Signal last week finished rolling out an update for iOS and Android designed to counter the trick. The new safeguard warns users when they link a new device and checks with them again at a randomized interval a few hours after that device is added to confirm that they still want to share all messages with it. Signal now also requires a form of authentication such as entering a passcode or using FaceID or TouchID on iOS to add a new linked device.\n\nIn fact, Signal had already been working to update those forms of phishing protections aimed specifically at exploitation of its linked device feature prior to Google's warning, says Signal's senior technologist, Josh Lund. But Google's report about Russia's spying in Ukraine provided an \u201cacute\u201d example of the problem that pushed them to move quickly to protect users, he says.\n\n\u201cWe're really grateful to the Google team for their help in making Signal more resilient to this type of social engineering,\u201d says Lund, using the cybersecurity term for tricks that deceive victims into giving hackers sensitive information or access to their systems.",

                "text": "As the United States reels from the upheaval caused by Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), hackers from countries the US considers hostile continue to wreak havoc from afar.\n\nNew research shows that China\u2019s Salt Typhoon hacking group has expanded its targets list to include universities around the world and at least two more telecoms operating in the US. That brings the total number of US telecommunications networks breached by Salt Typhoon to at least 11.\n\nRussia\u2019s notorious Sandworm hacking unit may be best known for its attacks on Ukraine, including multiple blackouts caused by its cyberattacks and its release of the destructive NotPetya malware. However, a hacking group within Sandworm is now taking aim at targets in Western nations, including Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, according to research released this week by Microsoft. The group, which Microsoft calls BadPilot, is known as an \u201cinitial access operation,\u201d breaching targets for the purpose of handing over access to those systems to other Sandworm hackers.\n\nMeanwhile, we dug into the slimy world of romance scammers who are making ill-gotten fortunes by capitalizing on the loneliness epidemic, and we dipped into the opaqueness of online advertising data that could pose a threat to US national security. Finally, we found that US funding cuts under the new Trump administration are hurting the organizations protecting children from exploitation, abuse, and human trafficking.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s DOGE finally started publishing some information about its activities on its threadbare website this week. But it wasn\u2019t the only entity publishing on the site.\n\nTwo web developers, working independently, found that it is possible to push updates to the DOGE.gov domain, which claims to be an official US government website. The website uses a database that can be edited by anyone online, the experts told 404Media. To demonstrate the insecurity, they left a couple of messages on the DOGE site: \u201cThis is a joke of a .gov site,\u201d one read, while the other says: \u201cTHESE \u2018EXPERTS\u2019 LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.\u201d\n\nThe messages stayed on the website for at least 12 hours and remained visible for some time on Friday. The DOGE website was launched in January and until this week was a single landing page containing very little information. The web experts who discovered the vulnerabilities told 404Media that the website appeared to have been \u201cslapped together.\u201d\n\nThe website only started being populated this week\u2014with some figures purporting to show the size of the US government\u2014after Musk promised his organization would be \u201cmaximally transparent.\u201d That transparency may have gone a step too far, however, with HuffPost reporting on Friday that the site included classified material.",

                "text": "A WIRED investigation into the inner workings of Google\u2019s advertising ecosystem reveals that a wealth of sensitive information on Americans is being openly served up to some of the world\u2019s largest brands despite the company\u2019s own rules against it. Experts say that when combined with other data, this information could be used to identify and target specific individuals.\n\nDisplay & Video 360 (DV360), one of the dominant marketing platforms offered by the search giant, is offering companies globally the option of targeting devices in the United States based on lists of internet users believed to suffer from chronic illnesses and financial distress, among other categories of personal data that are ostensibly banned under Google\u2019s public policies.\n\nOther lists of American users accessible for a price across the platform raise serious national security concerns, experts say, as they reveal data brokers striving to isolate millions of mobile devices carried by government workers\u2014from US judges and military service members to executive agency staff and employees on Capitol Hill.\n\nFirst reviewed by WIRED, an internal spreadsheet obtained from a US-based data broker shows the DV360 platform currently hosting hundreds if not thousands of restricted or otherwise sensitive \u201caudience segments,\u201d each containing a large tranche of data that points to countless mobile devices and online profiles of people in the US. The segments are generated not by Google, but by DV360 customers who upload them to the system, where others can use them to target ads at specific audiences.\n\nThe data\u2014first obtained by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Ireland's oldest independent human rights body\u2014reveals segments targeting hundreds of millions of device users based exclusively on health conditions, from chronic pain and menopause to, among others, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, arthritis, high cholesterol, and hypertension.\n\n\u201cAs with other demand-side platforms, advertisers are able to upload audience lists to Display & Video 360, based either on their own first-party data or from segment providers,\u201d says Erica Walsh, a Google spokesperson. \u201cOur policies do not permit audience segments to be used based on sensitive information like employment, health conditions, financial status, etc.\u201d\n\nDespite this, numerous segments contained in the data are clearly targeted at households and businesses based purely on data suggesting they\u2019re experiencing financial hardship\u2014aiming, for instance, to help advertisers identify people who are in the process of bankruptcy or burdened by long-term debt.\n\nAllison Bodack, another Google spokesperson, tells WIRED that when the company detects \u201cnon-compliant audience segments, we will take action.\u201d Asked to explain why Google had not detected segments with descriptions such as \u201cIndividuals likely to have a Cardiovascular condition,\u201d or \u201cParents of children likely to have a respiratory disease, like Asthma,\u201d Bodack did not respond.\n\nSegments accessible through DV360 that target Americans with asthma contain at least hundreds of millions of mobile IDs\u2014among them, a list simply titled, \u201cPeople who have asthma.\u201d Hundreds of millions more were found on lists for no other reason than the fact that their users are believed to have diabetes. A vast number of devices and user profiles are spread out across lists that target users determined likely to need specific medications, including some controlled substances, such as Ambien. One list links more than 140 million mobile IDs to opioid usage, suggesting the users need relief from a common \"opioid-induced\" side effect.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampages through the US government, its access to sensitive data is alarming federal agencies and Americans who interact with them. In the month since the Trump administration began its purge of federal workers, opponents fighting DOGE in court have been pinning their hopes of stopping the world\u2019s richest man on a 50-year-old law.\n\nIn just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management, government payment data at the Department of the Treasury, data on student loan recipients at the Department of Education, information on disaster victims at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and vast amounts of employment- and workplace-related data at the Department of Labor. White House staffers are even pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to grant DOGE access to US taxpayer records. The acting head of the Social Security Administration recently resigned rather than give DOGE access to her agency\u2019s reams of sensitive personal data.\n\nMore than half a dozen lawsuits are seeking to block DOGE employees from rifling through these vast troves of data. One thing they all have in common: They allege that DOGE\u2019s actions violate the Privacy Act of 1974.\n\nHere\u2019s how a law passed after Watergate could rein in another president whose self-professed zeal for retribution is unnerving constitutional experts.\n\nWhat Is the Privacy Act?\n\nThe Privacy Act is a law that limits how the federal government can collect, use, and share information about US citizens and other people in the United States.\n\nThe law\u2019s core features include letting people access government records about them; letting people correct those records if they contain mistakes; requiring agencies to limit information collection, publish lists of records databases, and protect data from hackers; and restricting how agency employees and third parties can access records.\n\nThose restrictions on accessing data are at the heart of the ongoing DOGE saga.\n\nThe Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing someone\u2019s records\u2014even within the agency\u2014unless that person approves in writing or the agency meets one of the law\u2019s 12 exceptions. Most of the exceptions deal with fairly specific circumstances, such as congressional oversight, law enforcement investigations, court orders, census work, statistical research, and National Archives preservation. But there are also two broad, vague exceptions: Agencies can share records with their own employees who \u201chave a need for the record in the performance of their duties\u201d or with third parties for \u201ca routine use\u201d (defined as one that is \u201ccompatible with the purpose for which [the data] was collected\u201d).\n\nWhy Did Congress Pass the Privacy Act?\n\nPresident Richard Nixon illegally used the powers of the government to investigate, intimidate, and punish his political enemies. He tried to use the IRS to target liberal political groups with audits and scrutiny of their tax exemptions, and he deployed the FBI to spy on and harass his political opponents. After Nixon\u2019s resignation over the Watergate scandal, lawmakers sought to prevent future presidents from weaponizing government power.\n\n\u201cCongress must act before sophisticated new systems of information gathering and retention are developed, and before they produce widespread abuses,\u201d North Carolina Democratic senator Sam Ervin said as he introduced one of the bills that inspired the Privacy Act. \u201cThe peculiarity of new complex technologies is that once they go into operation, it is too late to correct our mistakes or supply our oversight.\u201d",

                "text": "Last year, a media investigation revealed that a Florida-based data broker, Datastream Group, was selling highly sensitive location data that tracked United States military and intelligence personnel overseas. At the time, the origin of that data was unknown.\n\nNow, a letter sent to US senator Ron Wyden\u2019s office that was obtained by an international collective of media outlets\u2014including WIRED and 404 Media\u2014claims that the ultimate source of that data was Eskimi, a little-known Lithuanian ad-tech company. Eskimi, meanwhile, denies it had any involvement.\n\nEskimi\u2019s alleged role\u2014and its denials\u2014highlight the opaque nature of the location data industry: A data broker in Florida claims a Lithuanian company provided data on US military personnel in Germany. That data could theoretically be sold to essentially anyone. But the exact ways in which the data is collected, compiled, and shared remains unclear.\n\nThis article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a global insider threat risk, from some unknown advertising companies, and those companies are essentially breaking all these systems by abusing their access and selling this extremely sensitive data to brokers who further sell it to government and private interests,\u201d says Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push, referring to the ad-tech ecosystem broadly.\n\nIn December, the joint investigation by WIRED, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), and Netzpolitik.org analyzed a free sample of location data provided by Datastream. The investigation revealed that Datastream was offering access to precise location data from devices likely belonging to American military and intelligence personnel overseas\u2014including at German airbases believed to store US nuclear weapons. Datastream is a data broker in the location data history, sourcing data from other providers and then selling it to customers. Its website previously said it offered \u201cinternet advertising data coupled with hashed emails, cookies, and mobile location data.\u201d\n\nThat dataset contained 3.6 billion location coordinates, some logged at millisecond intervals, from up to 11 million mobile advertising IDs in Germany over a one-month period. The data was likely collected through SDKs (software development kits) embedded in mobile apps by developers who knowingly integrate tracking tools in exchange for revenue-sharing agreements with data brokers.\n\nFollowing this reporting, Wyden\u2019s office demanded answers from Datastream Group about its role in trafficking the location data of US military personnel. In response, Datastream identified Eskimi as its alleged source, claiming it obtained the data \u201clegitimately from a respected third-party provider, Eskimi.com.\u201d\n\nVytautas Paukstys, CEO of Eskimi, says that \u201cEskimi does not have or have ever had any commercial relationship with Datasys/Datastream Group,\u201d referring to another name that Datastream has used, and that Eskimi \u201cis not a data broker.\u201d A subsequent email from a company spokesperson says, \u201cEskimi does not have any commercial relationship with Datastream Group. Without a doubt, Eskimi did not share or sell location data of military personnel or any other data in Germany or Europe with Datastream group.\u201d\n\nIn an email responding to detailed questions from the reporting collective, M. Seth Lubin, an attorney representing Datastream Group, described the data as lawfully sourced from a third party. While Lubin acknowledged to Wyden that the data was intended for use in digital advertising, he stressed to the reporting collective that it was never intended for resale. Lubin declined to disclose the source of the data, citing a nondisclosure agreement, and dismissed the reporting collective\u2019s analysis as reckless and misleading.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) declined to answer specific questions related to our investigation. However, in December, DOD spokesperson Javan Rasnake said that the Pentagon is aware that geolocation services could put personnel at risk and urged service members to remember their training and adhere strictly to operational security protocols.",

                "text": "Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022, hackers and security researchers have tried to find holes in large language models (LLMs) to get around their guardrails and trick them into spewing out hate speech, bomb-making instructions, propaganda, and other harmful content. In response, OpenAI and other generative AI developers have refined their system defenses to make it more difficult to carry out these attacks. But as the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek rockets to prominence with its new, cheaper R1 reasoning model, its safety protections appear to be far behind those of its established competitors.\n\nToday, security researchers from Cisco and the University of Pennsylvania are publishing findings showing that, when tested with 50 malicious prompts designed to elicit toxic content, DeepSeek\u2019s model did not detect or block a single one. In other words, the researchers say they were shocked to achieve a \u201c100 percent attack success rate.\u201d\n\nThe findings are part of a growing body of evidence that DeepSeek\u2019s safety and security measures may not match those of other tech companies developing LLMs. DeepSeek\u2019s censorship of subjects deemed sensitive by China\u2019s government has also been easily bypassed.\n\n\u201cA hundred percent of the attacks succeeded, which tells you that there\u2019s a trade-off,\u201d DJ Sampath, the VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, tells WIRED. \u201cYes, it might have been cheaper to build something here, but the investment has perhaps not gone into thinking through what types of safety and security things you need to put inside of the model.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have had similar findings. Separate analysis published today by the AI security company Adversa AI and shared with WIRED also suggests that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a wide range of jailbreaking tactics, from simple language tricks to complex AI-generated prompts.\n\nDeepSeek, which has been dealing with an avalanche of attention this week and has not spoken publicly about a range of questions, did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about its model\u2019s safety setup.\n\nGenerative AI models, like any technological system, can contain a host of weaknesses or vulnerabilities that, if exploited or set up poorly, can allow malicious actors to conduct attacks against them. For the current wave of AI systems, indirect prompt injection attacks are considered one of the biggest security flaws. These attacks involve an AI system taking in data from an outside source\u2014perhaps hidden instructions of a website the LLM summarizes\u2014and taking actions based on the information.\n\nJailbreaks, which are one kind of prompt-injection attack, allow people to get around the safety systems put in place to restrict what an LLM can generate. Tech companies don\u2019t want people creating guides to making explosives or using their AI to create reams of disinformation, for example.\n\nJailbreaks started out simple, with people essentially crafting clever sentences to tell an LLM to ignore content filters\u2014the most popular of which was called \u201cDo Anything Now\u201d or DAN for short. However, as AI companies have put in place more robust protections, some jailbreaks have become more sophisticated, often being generated using AI or using special and obfuscated characters. While all LLMs are susceptible to jailbreaks, and much of the information could be found through simple online searches, chatbots can still be used maliciously.",

Amid the hype, researchers from the cloud security firm Wiz published findings on Wednesday that show that DeepSeek left one of its critical databases exposed on the internet, leaking system logs, user prompt submissions, and even users\u2019 API authentication tokens\u2014totaling more than 1 million records\u2014to anyone who came across the database.\n\nDeepSeek is a relatively new company and has been virtually unreachable to press and other organizations this week. In turn, the company did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment about the exposure. The Wiz researchers say that they themselves were unsure about how to disclose their findings to the company and simply sent information about the discovery on Wednesday to every DeepSeek email address and LinkedIn profile they could find or guess. The researchers have yet to receive a reply, but within a half hour of their mass contact attempt, the database they found was locked down and became inaccessible to unauthorized users. It is unclear whether any malicious actors or authorized parties accessed or downloaded any of the data.\n\n\u201cThe fact that mistakes happen is correct, but this is a dramatic mistake, because the effort level is very low and the access level that we got is very high,\u201d Ami Luttwak, the CTO of Wiz tells WIRED. \u201cI would say that it means that the service is not mature to be used with any sensitive data at all.\u201d\n\nExposed databases that are accessible to anyone on the open internet are a long-standing problem that institutions and cloud providers have slowly worked to address. But the Wiz researchers note that the DeepSeek database they found was visible almost immediately with minimal scanning or probing.\n\n\u201cUsually when we find this kind of exposure, it\u2019s in some neglected service that takes us hours to find\u2014hours of scanning,\u201d says Nir Ohfeld, the head of vulnerability research at Wiz. But this time, \u201chere it was at the front door.\u201d Ohfeld adds that the \u201ctechnical difficulty of this vulnerability is the bare minimum.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say that the trove they found appears to have been a type of open source database typically used for server analytics called a ClickHouse database. And the exposed information supported this, given that there were log files that contained the routes or paths users had taken through DeepSeek\u2019s systems, the users\u2019 prompts and other interactions with the service, and the API keys they had used to authenticate. The prompts the researchers saw were all in Chinese, but they note that it is possible the database also contained prompts in other languages. The researchers say they did the absolute minimum assessment needed to confirm their findings without unnecessarily compromising user privacy, but they speculate that it may even have been possible for a malicious actor to use such deep access to the database to move laterally into other DeepSeek systems and execute code in other parts of the company\u2019s infrastructure.",

                "text": "Brandon Russell, arguably one of the most influential figures in the American neofascist revival of the past decade, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore\u2019s power grid and trigger a race war.\n\nThe 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization that was responsible for five homicides and a number of bomb plots before the FBI dismantled it in 2020, Russell was arrested by federal agents in February 2023 along with his girlfriend, Sarah Clendaniel. If convicted of his charges of conspiring to destroy an energy facility, Russell could face 20 years behind bars thanks to a prior conviction and the potential penalty for his current charges.\n\nRussell\u2019s case represents one of the last gasps of the Biden administration\u2019s hard-charging approach to tackling violent far-right extremism that is all but guaranteed to change during US president Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office. It also offers a unique look inside federal law enforcement\u2019s investigation into an insidious accelerationist propaganda network that mixes neo-Nazi ideology with nihilist, Columbine-style violence to inspire mass casualty events in the United States and beyond.\n\nRussell allegedly hatched the plot to black out Baltimore while, according to prosecutors, participating in a noxious, prolific propaganda network hellbent on fomenting violence and chaos. The Terrorgram Collective, which took its name following a massive influx of neo-Nazis to Telegram at the end of the last decade, ran several channels on the messaging\u200b\u200b app and developed a series of \u201chow-to\u201d domestic terrorism manuals that sought to inspire disaffected young men and women into committing mass casualty events. Terrorgram is currently designated a \u201ctier one\u201d extremism threat by the US Department of Justice.\n\nTo date, Terrorgram has released four publications\u2014a blend of ideological motivation, mass-murder worship, neofascist indoctrination, and how-to manuals for chemical weapons attacks, infrastructure sabotage, and ethnic cleansing. Court records indicate there are at least three unreleased Terrorgram Collective compendiums, including \u201cThe Saint Encyclopedia\u201d of the far-right mass killers they venerate, including Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Timothy McVeigh; and \u201cThe List,\u201d a collection of politicians, government officials, business leaders, journalists, activists, and other people deemed legitimate assassination targets.\n\nThe screeds appear to have directly inspired a series of ideologically motivated attacks around the world, including a 2022 mass shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, successful attacks on power infrastructure in North Carolina and similar failed plots in Baltimore and New Jersey, and a stabbing spree in the Turkish city of Eskisehir. There are currently more than a dozen separate federal prosecutions around the United States that involve people alleged to be core Terrorgram Collective members or individuals allegedly inspired toward violent attacks on infrastructure or civilians.\n\nIn one of the Biden administration\u2019s last policy moves against right-wing extremism, on January 13, the State Department formally classified the Terrorgram Collective as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a listing usually reserved for militant groups that hold territory and have a formal real-world paramilitary structure as opposed to a loose propaganda network that seeks to inspire mass casualty events. While it is not unique\u2014the British Home Office formally proscribed Terrorgram as an extremist organization last May, and Russell\u2019s Atomwaffen Division was banned by the UK, Australia, and Canada\u2014it is likely to be the last such action taken toward neo-Nazi groups by the United States government for the foreseeable future.",

                "text": "The United States\u2019 recent regulatory action against the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok prompted mass migration to another Chinese app, the social platform \u201cRednote.\u201d Now, a generative artificial intelligence platform from the Chinese developer DeepSeek is exploding in popularity, posing a potential threat to US AI dominance and offering the latest evidence that moratoriums like the TikTok ban will not stop Americans from using Chinese-owned digital services.\n\nDeepSeek, an AI research lab created by a prominent Chinese hedge fund, recently gained popularity after releasing its latest open source generative AI model that easily competes with top US platforms like those developed by OpenAI. However, to help avoid US sanctions on hardware and software, DeepSeek created some clever workarounds when building its models. On Monday, DeepSeek\u2019s creators limited new sign-ups after claiming the app had been overrun with a \u201clarge-scale malicious attack.\u201d\n\nWhile DeepSeek has several AI models, some of which can be downloaded and run locally on your laptop, the majority of people will likely access the service through its iOS or Android apps or its web chat interface. Like with other generative AI models, you can ask it questions and get answers; it can search the web; or it can alternatively use a reasoning model to elaborate on answers.\n\nDeepSeek, which does not appear to have established a communications department or press contact yet, did not return a request for comment from WIRED about its user data protections and the extent to which it prioritizes data privacy initiatives.\n\nAs people clamor to test out the AI platform, though, the demand brings into focus how the Chinese startup collects user data and sends it home. Users have already reported several examples of DeepSeek censoring content that is critical of China or its policies. The AI setup appears to collect a lot of information\u2014including all your chat messages\u2014and send it back to China. In many ways, it\u2019s likely sending more data back to China than TikTok has in recent years, since the social media company moved to US cloud hosting to try to deflect US security concerns\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a panic over Chinese AI to remind people that most companies in the business set the terms for how they use your private data\u201d says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab. \u201cAnd that when you use their services, you\u2019re doing work for them, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nWhat DeepSeek Collects About You\n\nTo be clear, DeepSeek is sending your data to China. The English-language DeepSeek privacy policy, which lays out how the company handles user data, is unequivocal: \u201cWe store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\u201d\n\nIn other words, all the conversations and questions you send to DeepSeek, along with the answers that it generates, are being sent to China or can be. DeepSeek\u2019s privacy policies also outline the information it collects about you, which falls into three sweeping categories: information that you share with DeepSeek, information that it automatically collects, and information that it can get from other sources.",

They\u2019ll frequently stoop to blackmail\u2014and are constantly creating more devious approaches to incorporate it into their grifts. In recent months, cybercriminals have taken their blackmailing efforts up a notch, creating realistic-looking \u201cnews\u201d videos that claim their victims are wanted for crimes.\n\nScammers based in West Africa, likely in Nigeria, and going under the broad umbrella of the Yahoo Boys, have increasingly been seen sending blackmail victims videos likely using AI-generated news anchors in a bid to pressure victims into paying up. A WIRED review of posts on Telegram by self-styled Yahoo Boys shows the cybercriminals are impersonating television stations based in the US and sharing tutorials about how to create the blackmailing videos.\n\nThe videos follow a sinister pattern. One video\u2014which can be seen in the image below\u2014uses CNN\u2019s logo and branding to impersonate the news organization, with text at the bottom of the screen describing the \u201cbreaking news.\u201d On the screen, a likely AI-generated newsreader starts talking.\n\n\u201cGood day. My name is Kristina Lawson, reporting from New Jersey,\u201d the anchor says in the nearly minute-long clip. \u201cJust in: We have received a credible report regarding a disturbing incident.\u201d The fake presenter says that a \u201cyoung lady\u201d has come forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted by an older man. In the video, the man, who is the target of the scam, is named, and a photograph of him appears onscreen.\n\nOther videos seen by WIRED feature different news readers and names of news channels, but they also show more graphic photos of the potential blackmail targets, including nude and explicit images. In one \u201cnews\u201d clip, the screen is split in two, with a photo of a man\u2019s face on one side and the other side is a short video clip of him allegedly masturbating.\n\nDavid Maimon, the head of fraud insights at SentiLink and a professor at Georgia State University who first spotted the CNN video in December, says the fraudsters have made a number of \u201cdisturbing\u201d changes to their blackmailing tactics in recent months, including trying to humiliate people and potentially targeting those outside of English-speaking countries.",

                "text": "This week started off with a bang and just kept going. In the wee hours of Saturday night, TikTok cut off access to users in the United States ahead of Sunday\u2019s deadline that forced Apple and Google to remove the video-sharing app from their app stores. While TikTok was dark, US users raced to get around the TikTok ban while several other unexpected apps saw their access to Americans severed as well. By midday on Sunday, however, TikTok access was already coming back in the US. By Monday night, newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump had signed an executive order delaying the TikTok ban by 75 days.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made good on his promise to free Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road dark-web market, where users sold drugs, guns, and worse. Ulbricht had spent more than 11 years behind bars after he was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and later sentenced to life in prison. Trump\u2019s decision to pardon Ulbricht is largely seen as linked to the support he\u2019s received from the libertarian cryptocurrency community, which has long considered the Silk Road creator a martyr.\n\nAs the world enters the second Trump era, WIRED sat down with Jen Easterly, who recently left her top spot as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to discuss the cyber threats facing the US and CISA\u2019s uncertain future as the frontline watchdog against nation-state hackers and other digital security threats facing the US.\n\nLastly, we detailed new research that revealed how trivial bugs had exposed Subaru\u2019s system for tracking the locations of its customers\u2019 vehicles. The researchers found they could access a web portal for Subaru employees that allowed them to pinpoint up to a years\u2019 worth of a car\u2019s location\u2014down to the parking spots they use. The flaws are now patched, but Subaru employees still have access to sensitive driver location data.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nA US judge in New York this week found that the FBI\u2019s practice of searching data on US persons under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without obtaining a warrant is unconstitutional. FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform \u201cbackdoor searches\u201d for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. \u201cTo hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702\u2014including those of US persons\u2014that can later be searched on demand without limitation,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nAn \u201cissue\u201d with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare\u2019s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples\u2019 internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person\u2019s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image\u2014and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.\n\nIn one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency\u2019s advisory committees. This includes the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was investigating widespread attacks on the US telecommunications system by the China-backed hacker group Salt Typhoon. US authorities revealed in mid-November that Salt Typhoon had embedded itself in at least nine US telecoms for espionage purposes, potentially exposing anyone using unencrypted calls and text message to surveillance by Beijing. While the future of the CSRB remains uncertain, sources tell reporter Eric Geller that their investigation into Salt Typhoon\u2019s attacks is effectively \u201cdead.\u201d",

                "text": "Curry and Shah reported their findings to Subaru in late November, and Subaru quickly patched its Starlink security flaws. But the researchers warn that the Subaru web vulnerabilities are just the latest in a long series of similar web-based flaws they and other security researchers working with them have found that have affected well over a dozen carmakers, including Acura, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, and many others. There\u2019s little doubt, they say, that similarly serious hackable bugs exist in other auto companies' web tools that have yet to be discovered.\n\nIn Subaru's case, in particular, they also point out that their discovery hints at how pervasively those with access to Subaru's portal can track its customers' movements, a privacy issue that will last far longer than the web vulnerabilities that exposed it. \u201cThe thing is, even though this is patched, this functionality is still going to exist for Subaru employees,\u201d Curry says. \u201cIt's just normal functionality that an employee can pull up a year's worth of your location history.\u201d\n\nWhen WIRED reached out to Subaru for comment on Curry and Shah's findings, a spokesperson responded in a statement that \u201cafter being notified by independent security researchers, [Subaru] discovered a vulnerability in its Starlink service that could potentially allow a third party to access Starlink accounts. The vulnerability was immediately closed and no customer information was ever accessed without authorization.\u201d\n\nThe Subaru spokesperson also confirmed to WIRED that \u201cthere are employees at Subaru of America, based on their job relevancy, who can access location data.\" The company offered as an example that employees have that access to share a vehicle's location with first responders in the case when a collision is detected. \u201cAll these individuals receive proper training and are required to sign appropriate privacy, security, and NDA agreements as needed,\u201d Subaru's statement added. \u201cThese systems have security monitoring solutions in place which are continually evolving to meet modern cyber threats.\u201d\n\nResponding to Subaru's example of notifying first responders about a collision, Curry notes that would hardly require a year's worth of location history. The company didn't respond to WIRED asking how far back it keeps customers' location histories and makes them available to employees.\n\nShah and Curry's research that led them to the discovery of Subaru's vulnerabilities began when they found that Curry's mother's Starlink app connected to the domain SubaruCS.com, which they realized was an administrative domain for employees. Scouring that site for security flaws, they found that they could reset employees' passwords simply by guessing their email address, which gave them the ability to take over any employee's account whose email they could find. The password reset functionality did ask for answers to two security questions, but they found that those answers were checked with code that ran locally in a user's browser, not on Subaru's server, allowing the safeguard to be easily bypassed. \u201cThere were really multiple systemic failures that led to this,\u201d Shah says.\n\nThe two researchers say they found the email address for a Subaru Starlink developer on LinkedIn, took over the employee's account, and immediately found that they could use that staffer's access to look up any Subaru owner by last name, zip code, email address, phone number, or license plate to access their Starlink configurations. In seconds, they could then reassign control of the Starlink features of that user's vehicle, including the ability to remotely unlock the car, honk its horn, start its ignition, or locate it, as shown in the video below.",

                "text": "When I walk into Jen Easterly\u2019s office on a bright January day in Arlington, Virginia, I\u2019m greeted by a giant shark head lurking on the floor. I instantly spot a Rubik\u2019s Cube\u2014an Easterly hallmark\u2014emblazoned with the logo of the organization she\u2019s run for the past three and a half years\u2014the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which President Donald Trump created during his first term.\n\nEasterly, who is 56 years old, jumps to her feet to greet me. The first thing that hits me is her denim pants, which have a dragon on one leg and a serpent on the other. Then she launches into updates on CISA\u2019s animated \u201cSecure Our World\u201d video series and, in the same breath, laments that she hasn\u2019t had time for a private guitar lesson in weeks. Seemingly a regular day on the job for her, except for one thing. As of January 20, Inauguration Day, Easterly\u2019s time at CISA would be over. Trump had fired the agency\u2019s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn\u2019t asked to stay. Rumors are swirling that CISA programs\u2014or even the entire agency\u2014may soon be on Trump\u2019s chopping block.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group called Salt Typhoon spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year\u2014warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.\n\nThe work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn\u2019t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be \u201csmaller\u201d and \u201cmore nimble.\u201d And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board\u2014who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches\u2014were let go.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nWhen Easterly officially became the agency\u2019s second director, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack\u2014SolarWinds. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn\u2019t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or\u2014more realistically\u2014get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.\n\nIt takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley\u2019s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she\u2019s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there\u2019s her eclectic style\u2014high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks\u2014but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions.

                "text": "A little over 11 years and three months ago, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in the science fiction section of a public library in San Francisco, caught with his laptop still logged in to the Silk Road, the world\u2019s first dark-web drug market that he created and ran under the pseudonym the Dread Pirate Roberts.\n\nNow, after being sentenced to life in prison and spending more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht will walk free, thanks to Donald Trump\u2014and to the president\u2019s ever-closer ties to the American cryptocurrency world.\n\n\u201cI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\u201d president Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, misspelling Ulbricht's last name. \u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!\u201d\n\nFor close to two and a half years after Ulbricht created the Silk Road in 2011, the dark-web site facilitated the sale of vast amounts of narcotics, as well as counterfeit documents, money laundering services and, at times, guns, for hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin payments. After the FBI located the Silk Road\u2019s server in Iceland in 2013 and arrested then 29-year-old Ulbricht in San Francisco, he was convicted on seven charges relating to the distribution of narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, as well as a \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise\u201d statute\u2014sometimes known as the \u201ckingpin statute\u201d\u2014usually reserved for mob bosses and cartel leaders. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison, a punishment beyond even the 20-plus years that prosecutors in the case requested.\n\nSince then, a Free Ross movement has steadily pressed for Ulbricht\u2019s release, first in a failed appeal, then in petitions for clemency. Many of Ulbricht\u2019s supporters have long argued that the Silk Road was a principled libertarian experiment in free trade, one in which Ulbricht allowed only \u201cvictimless crime\u201d\u2014despite prosecutors arguing during his trial that at least six people died of opioid overdoses from drugs linked to the Silk Road. They point out that Ulbricht never actually sold or possessed drugs himself, and rather ran a website that facilitated their sale. And they argue that by moving the sale of narcotics online, he reduced violence in the drug trade and committed no violence himself.\n\nThat argument has been complicated, however, by allegations that Ulbricht tried to have six people killed who presented a threat to him or the Silk Road. Ultimately all six alleged murders-for-hire were fake\u2014one was staged by undercover DEA agents and five more were a scam. Ulbricht was charged with only one of those alleged paid killings in a separate prosecution in Maryland, which was then dropped after he received a life sentence in his New York trial. But evidence presented at Ulbricht\u2019s trial showed him allegedly arranging those killings and even pinpointed transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that showed a payment for them from Ulbricht\u2019s laptop to the would-be killer.\n\nThose allegations of murders-for-hire, in fact, dissuaded the first Trump administration from granting clemency to Ulbricht. The White House in 2020 considered freeing Ulbricht but ultimately rejected the idea because of the alleged role of violence in the case, according to one former government official involved in the process who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity.\n\nSince then, however, the Trump administration has shifted its stance on Ulbricht\u2019s case\u2014in part, perhaps, due to its embrace of the libertarian cryptocurrency community, for whom Ulbricht has become a martyr and cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. At the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, last May, then presidential candidate Trump promised to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence \u201con day one\u201d if reelected. (Ultimately, day one passed with no clemency for Ulbricht, even as Trump pardoned more than a thousand participants in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, though Trump ally Elon Musk promised in a post to X on Monday evening that \u201cRoss will be freed too.\u201d)",

                "text": "Honorable Mentions\n\nThere are a few products we've tested that we liked but didn't love that are still worth mentioning, in case you're considering them.\n\nThe Boring Hybrid Mattress for $799: Boring Mattress is a new company founded by two alums from Tuft & Needle. Simplicity is the company's selling point. There is just one option: the Boring Hybrid Mattress. (You are allowed to pick a size.) This 10-inch hybrid has four layers of both foam and springs. I\u2019m very sensitive to joint pain, and certain beds tend to make it worse, which is why pressure relief is super important for me. Having slept on a variety of different mattresses throughout the years, I was doubtful that this one would work. But I\u2019ve slept on the hybrid mattress for months now and have yet to feel any pain at all. It strikes an excellent balance between firmness and support that my very particular self hasn\u2019t been able to find with other options on the market. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that its layers come equipped with an open-cell design that\u2019s designed to move heat from your body while sleeping. I\u2019m usually cold, so this feature isn\u2019t that important to me. But on nights when I\u2019ve cranked the heat up in my room and woken up sweating a bit, I can\u2019t say it worked all that well for me. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but I wouldn\u2019t buy it solely for that. \u2014Brenda Stolyar\n\nThe Airweave Advanced for $4,500: The unique Airweave Advanced (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great pick for anyone who wants something they can easily move and wash and who likes a firm mattress. Designed by a Japanese engineer and inspired by a tangled fishing line, the Airweave is filled with blocks made from a unique ultra-fine woven polyethylene. My king-sized tester came with three slabs of filler to be combined inside the cover, each weighing less than 40 pounds. I am a large-bodied side sleeper and prefer a slightly softer bed, but I slept very well on the Airweave during my week of testing. Note that Airweaves are very spendy, with a queen going for $4,500.\n\nCasper The One for $599: Casper was a leader in the first wave of bed-in-a-box makers in 2014. The company has changed ownership and design a few times over the past decade but last year's launch of The One finds the company keeping pace with competitors. This is an all-foam mattress that stands 11 inches tall. Because it's all foam, it\u2019s on the light side, with a queen weighing an easily movable 66 pounds. One of the main issues with all-foam beds is that they get too hot, but Casper\u2019s The One uses an open-cell foam layer called Breathe Flex Foam on the top, which makes it both pleasantly squishy and breathable. Two more layers of foam add up to a medium-firm feel, with the middle layer designed to cradle your hips, and the base layer designed to provide support.\n\nNolah Evolution 15 for $1,624:: The Nolah Evolution 15 is a big, sturdy, and firm bed that is made with quality materials and that sleeps more like a traditional innerspring mattress than most hybrids. It felt like an overstuffed balloon out of the box and took two full weeks to break in. It has seven layers, including a full inch of high-density foam and a layer of heavy-duty 13.75-gauge pocketed coils.\n\nThe Winkbed for $1,499: Reviewer Julian Chokkattu slept on the luxury firm version of the WinkBed for almost two years and he was quite happy in that time. His favorite perk? The edge support is fantastic, so his partner never wakes when he slips into bed late at night. The plush pillowtop also adds a luxe, hotel-like feel to a relatively firm bed.\n\nNest Bedding Quail for $1,039: When it comes to all-foam mattresses from classic bed-in-a-box brands, I prefer the Casper above but the Quail by Nest is a nice option if you want an all-foam bed that's a little firmer and you're willing to pay a little more. My biggest issue with the Nest was that despite its claimed cooling system\u2014the foam is infused with minerals and designed with an airflow layer\u2014I did sleep a little hot on it during my week of testing.\n\nPhotograph: Wired\n\nHelix Sunset Elite for $2,999: Our top pick, Helix, also has an Elite collection that consists of seven mattresses along a spectrum of softness. At 16 inches high, this is \"the tallest mattress on the internet,\" and comes shipped in two separate boxes, each heavy enough to max out FedEx requirements. The firmness is dictated by the foam density of the upper layer, which zips into a larger support system. This makes the mattress adjustable if you end up regretting your order. The bottom section has two separate layers of microcoils. I spent a month sleeping on the softest model from the Elite line, dubbed the Sunset, and appreciated the deep cradling effect. Helix offers a 100-day trial period on all of its mattresses.\n\nLinenspa 10-Inch Hybrid Mattress for $300: You will spend a third of your life on your mattress and if you have more than $300 to spend, you should. If you don't\u2014or if you need a cheap temporary bed for some reason\u2014the 10-inch Linenspa is about as cheap as hybrids get and was perfectly serviceable in my weeks of testing. You may notice some minor manufacturing flaws in this bed, which is made in Macedonia. If you dig into the 100,000-plus Amazon reviews you'll also see some complaints about its durability.\n\nWayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $405: This plush mattress has a top layer of cooling gel that conforms to your body for comfort and has classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foams with varying thickness surrounding the coils for extra support (the coils and memory foam mixture helps with low motion transfer, too). The top knit cover and sides help with breathability and the overall cooling effect. The mattress is also compatible with an adjustable bed base, has solid edge support, is CertiPUR-US and Oeko-Tex Certified (ensuring no harmful toxins), and has a 10-year warranty. This bed is super comfy if you like a more plush mattress.\n\nMattresses to Avoid\n\nThere are some models you should avoid. Many of these beds are extremely affordable, and if you aren't picky, they may feel fine. In other cases, the mattress is decent but the price is not.\n\nTempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt for $2,199: Tempur-Pedic is one of the country's best-known and loved mattress brands, but two separate WIRED reviewers (Martin Cizmar and Nena Farrell) have both disliked different mattresses from the company over the past two years. Nena found the Tempur-Adapt totally lacking in support, and felt like she was sinking into a void when she laid on it. Her spine and muscles both ached after sleeping on it so she gave it to her sister who also hated it, describing it as like sleeping on a leaky air mattress,\n\nMagniflex Magnistretch 12 for $3,079: This mattress is Italian-made and advertises itself as stretching the spine. It\u2019s endorsed by retired Italian soccer player Giorgio Chiellini and current pro basketballer Stefano Tonut, who plays for the Italian equivalent of the Boston Celtics. Well, the Magniflex definitely does something to the spine, though I found it very unwelcome. (It's worth noting that I am not the same Martin Cizmar who played a little pro soccer in Slovakia.) I lasted only two nights on the Magnistretch before crying uncle and limping over to my next tester. The morning-after sensation was as if I'd slept on a hammock made of chainlink fence, and my lower back was left feeling weak and creaky\u2014very possibly it was stretched, and if so, it turns out I don't like having my back stretched.\n\nSleep Number Climate360 Smart Bed for $7,999: This bed (5/10, WIRED Review) can be temperature-controlled, which is amazing. The adjustable base means you can be comfortable when watching TV, reading, or sleeping. Unfortunately, the price tag has too many digits, and sleep experts recommend avoiding electronic usage before bed\u2014advice the Sleep IQ app defies. Did we mention it costs as much as a used Buick and the weight is not far behind?\n\nAmazon Basics mattress for $408: This one is made of cheap foam that isn't dense enough, causing too much sinkage.\n\nParachute Eco Comfort Mattress for $2,400: This mattress just doesn't live up to its extravagant price. The model we tested didn't have enough proper padding above its coils.",

                "text": "The rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI platform, heightened concerns this week over the United States\u2019 AI dominance as Americans increasingly adopt Chinese-owned digital services. With ongoing criticism over alleged security issues posed by TikTok\u2019s relationship to China, DeepSeek\u2019s own privacy policy confirms that it stores user data on servers in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, security researchers at Wiz discovered that DeepSeek left a critical database exposed online, leaking over 1 million records, including user prompts, system logs, and API authentication tokens. As the platform promotes its cheaper R1 reasoning model, security researchers tested 50 well-known jailbreaks against DeepSeek\u2019s chatbot and found lagging safety protections as compared to Western competitors.\n\nBrandon Russell, the 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore\u2019s power grid and trigger a race war. The trial provides a look into federal law enforcement\u2019s investigation into a disturbing propaganda network aiming to inspire mass casualty events in the US and beyond.\n\nAn informal group of West African fraudsters calling themselves the Yahoo Boys are using AI-generated news anchors to extort victims, producing fabricated news reports falsely accusing them of crimes. A WIRED review of Telegram posts reveals that these scammers create highly convincing fake news broadcasts to pressure victims into paying ransoms by threatening public humiliation.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal, hacking groups with known ties to China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea are leveraging AI chatbots like Google Gemini to assist with tasks such as writing malicious code and researching potential attack targets.\n\nWhile Western officials and security experts have long warned about AI's potential for malicious use, the Journal, citing a Wednesday report from Google, noted that the dozens of hacking groups across more than 20 countries are primarily using the platform as a research and productivity tool\u2014focusing on efficiency rather than developing sophisticated and novel hacking techniques.\n\nIranian groups, for instance, used the chatbot to generate phishing content in English, Hebrew, and Farsi. China-linked groups used Gemini for tactical research into technical concepts like data exfiltration and privilege escalation. In North Korea, hackers used it to draft cover letters for remote technology jobs, reportedly in support of the regime\u2019s effort to place spies in tech roles to fund its nuclear program.\n\nThis is not the first time foreign hacking groups have been found using chatbots. Last year, OpenAI disclosed that five such groups had used ChatGPT in similar ways.\n\nOn Friday, WhatsApp disclosed that nearly 100 journalists and civil society members were targeted by spyware developed by the Israeli firm Paragon Solutions. The Meta-owned company alerted affected individuals, stating with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that at least 90 users had been targeted and \u201cpossibly compromised,\u201d according to a statement to The Guardian. WhatsApp did not reveal where the victims were located, including whether any were in the United States.\n\nThe attack appears to have used a \u201czero-click\u201d exploit, meaning victims were infected without needing to open a malicious link or attachment. Once a phone is compromised, the spyware\u2014known as Graphite\u2014grants the operator full access, including the ability to read end-to-end encrypted messages sent via apps like WhatsApp and Signal.",

We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d Other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut and Lemon8, also disappeared from US app stores.\n\nSuch a ban has never existed in the US before, so the technical methods being employed to implement it are still evolving, and circumvention techniques may need to change as well. The law driving the situation, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), doesn\u2019t make it illegal to have TikTok on your phone. And, notably, it also doesn\u2019t say that TikTok itself has to stop the app from working in the US.\n\nNonetheless, the company said in the days before the law took effect that it planned to make the app inaccessible to US users\u2014a level of cooperation and accommodation that the outgoing Biden White House called a \u201cstunt\u201d on Saturday afternoon. Even if TikTok itself had obligations under the law, the Biden White House had signaled that it did not plan to enforce the ban before Trump took office on Monday.\n\nRather than putting the pressure on TikTok, PAFACA requires app stores and cloud hosting services to stop doing anything to \u201cdistribute, maintain or update\u201d TikTok. That puts the pressure on Apple and Google to stop new users from downloading TikTok, as well as infrastructure providers like Oracle to keep new content or software updates from reaching the app\u2019s users. Over time, TikTok would likely degrade and become unusable.\n\nOfficials in India banned TikTok in 2020, and the company also proactively blacked out the app in that case. When Indian users who already had the app installed tried to launch it, a pop-up appeared telling them that they couldn\u2019t access the service.\n\nDevashish Gosain, a network analysis researcher and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, says that in India, TikTok users must remove their Indian SIM card from their phone or use an international SIM card and then run a VPN in order to load content in the app.",

                "text": "In my testing, speeds with TunnelBear were competitive with the other options listed here. One of my favorite parts of TunnelBear is the free trial option, which makes it easy to test-drive it and see what your speeds are like without committing. TunnelBear has fewer geographic server locations than some of our other options, but unless you're traveling abroad or need to get around a specific geo-restriction, that shouldn't matter for most users.\n\nTunnelBear costs $3.33 per month if you buy one year upfront.\n\nThe Fastest VPN\n\nNordVPN has been in our guide for years, though after some bad customer-service incidents we pulled it out to retest. After testing NordVPN over the past six months, and repeatedly asking customer service to solve problems, which they did, I am adding it back to our list of recommendations.\n\nIn 2020 Nord Security merged with Surfshark VPN (recommended above). Both VPNs continue to operate independently, but there is considerable overlap in the services offered. Nord's parent company is based in Panama, which is outside the 14-Eyes Alliance, meaning there's nothing forcing NordVPN to gather user data.\n\nNordVPN has much to recommend about it, perhaps the highlight being speed, especially when it comes to upload speeds, which makes it a popular choice for sharing torrents. I like the built-in ad and tracking blocker in the mobile app, and NordVPN is great for unblocking entertainment sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Max. The NordVPN apps offer a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and it supports multi-hop VPN connections. NordVPN supports a good variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and what the company calls NordLynx, which is based on WireGuard.\n\nNordVPN's track record for privacy is pretty good too. In October 2024, in connection with a criminal investigation, NordVPN received a binding warrant from the Panamanian government to provide user data. The company says \u201cthe only information we were able to provide was payment-related data and confirmation about the existence of the account tied to the email address provided to us by the authorities.\u201d\n\nBest for High-Risk Use Cases\n\nIf you're in a situation where personal security is of the utmost importance, do not rely on a VPN. Use Tor (ideally through Tails) instead. Using the Tor network accomplishes some of the same things as a VPN, but it's different. Tor provides anonymity, meaning no one can figure out who you are, but not necessarily privacy. People still might be able to see what you're doing, they won't know it's you doing it. (VPNs provide privacy because no one can see what you're doing while you're going out of a VPN tunnel, but you don't have anonymity because the VPN provider knows who you are.)\n\nTor is simple to set up. All you need to do is download the Tor browser and it will connect you to the web. Once connected to the Tor network, you can browse the web normally. Except everything will be slower. When using Tor, your request for a website hops around the Tor network, bouncing between servers, before emerging and connecting to the site you want to visit. This makes Tor slow, sometimes incredibly slow, but that's necessary to protect your anonymity. And yes, you can combine a VPN with Tor, though that's somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.\n\nOther VPNs We\u2019ve Tried\n\nExpressVPN: We also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it.\n\nWe also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it. Google One VPN: Google One VPN was part of Google One but is slated to be shut down. We never recommended it\u2014let us not forget that Google has repeatedly been caught collecting data that it said it wasn't collecting, which is not what you want to hear from a VPN provider. Nor do we recommend the VPN that comes with Google Fi or the one available in Pixel phones. If you aren't paying for your VPN, two things will happen: It will either shut down, or you will be the thing being sold. Most of the VPNs we recommend are about $5 per month; real privacy is worth $5 a month.\n\nThere are a lot of VPNs out there, but most are not worth your money. If all you want to do is circumvent some Netflix geographic restrictions, then just about any of them will work (we still suggest sticking with our recommended options, but if you can't be stopped, then carry on). For anything more serious, like actually protecting your privacy and data, learn to use Tor. Yes, it's a little technical, but trust me, it's worth learning how to do if your life, family, and job are at stake.\n\nThe Best Free VPN\n\nAs noted above, ProtonVPN has a free version. It's limited to a single device and there are only three servers to connect to which means it can be slow. There are no logs, no ads, and no other limits. In my testing, it was slower than the paid account, but it does work. Several other VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, here's the details on NordVPN's refund policy.\n\nOther than that, it's worth keeping in mind the adage, \u201cIf you're not paying for it, you are the product.\u201d Do not trust a VPN that isn't taking your money (and don't trust many that are either). The good news is that all the picks above offer free trials, which allow you to evaluate how well each VPN will work in your unique situation and for your needs.",

                "text": "If you're worried about possible expansions of government surveillance and access to your information, or simply want to do some digital purging so you're not saddled with old data, there are a bunch of concrete steps you can take to protect your digital privacy. Just as archeologists study carefully preserved tombs and ancient trash heaps to gain insight into historic communities, your long-forgotten digital footprint could be more revealing and sensitive than you realize. And while you can't control everything\u2014particularly information stolen in breaches or gathered by data brokers\u2014you probably have a digital attic full of old data that you can delete or download and save offline. First stop? Old message histories.\n\nChats are a good place to start your digital decluttering. Their real-time nature makes it easy to forget that if you don't have auto-delete turned on for a chat (or if a platform doesn't offer it), all of those \u201cbe there in 10 minutes,\u201d \u201cwait, what color is this dress???\u201d and \u201cwelp, I have covid\u201d messages are still knocking around years later. If you sent them on an end-to-end encrypted platform like Signal or WhatsApp, they only exist on your device and the devices of the other person or people you were chatting with. That means that for governments or bad actors to read them, they would need direct control of your device\u2014a good level of protection, though not foolproof.\n\nCrucially, though, messages that you sent on regular web apps like Slack, Facebook Messenger for most of its history, and Google Chat/Hangouts/Gchat are sitting on a cloud server somewhere. And while they're probably stored in an encrypted form to protect against theft, the platform itself has the keys to decrypt your data and would be able to comply with government requests for it, no matter how old the information is. Sure, all of those \u201cu up?\"s may not seem significant now, but years and years of chat histories can paint a very detailed picture of your life, associations, political beliefs, and past movements and activity.\n\n\u201cDoing a good digital cleaning from time to time is a great habit, especially with social media and old chat messages,\u201d says Kenn White, security principal at the database developer MongoDB and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. \u201cWho you were five or 10 years ago is probably very different than who you are today, so it's worth asking yourself, \u2018Do I really need those seven-year-old inside jokes and sarcastic posts? Do I need to keep old group chat messages and carry them forward to every new phone I get?\u2019\u201d\n\nSome programs like Apple's Messages make it easy to auto-delete your chat histories after a set period of time. On iOS, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and then scroll and tap Keep Messages. Then choose whether to keep messages forever, for one year, or for 30 days before auto-deleting.\n\nOn the free version of Slack, data older than a year is automatically deleted. The company keeps data forever on paid plans, unless the administrator sets up rolling deletion. This is useful if you have an active Slack with your friends, but most people who use Slack at work don't make decisions about administrative policies and can't control deletion. Keep this in mind for any communication you do on an employer's platforms. You may be able to go through and delete messages or files one by one, but you likely won't have the access to make policy decisions about automatic or batch deletion.",

If you own a more recent smartphone from Apple, you might be able to use precision location data to find the hidden device.\n\nMonths after the release of the AirTag, Apple launched the Tracker Detect app for Android phones, where users had to initiate the scan. Google and Apple since have continued working together to make it easier for Android phones to detect unwanted AirTag trackers and for Apple phones to spot Android trackers. Recently, Google rolled out automatic smartphone alerts for unknown Bluetooth trackers, similar to what iPhone owners receive for AirTags.\n\nPhotograph: Google\n\nWhile some guides to finding AirTags recommend using Bluetooth scanners, Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation does not consider this method to be reliable for tracker searching. \u201cI have tried using various Bluetooth scanners in order to detect AirTags, and they do not work all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nMillions of Americans still do not own a smartphone. Without a device on hand, you must rely on visual and audible clues to find any hidden AirTags. The circular white disc is slightly larger than a quarter. As reported by The New York Times, Ashley Estrada discovered an AirTag lodged under her license plate, and her video documenting the incident was viewed more than 22 million times on TikTok.\n\nWhen the AirTag was first released, the tracker would emit a beeping noise if away from the owner for longer than three days. Apple has since shortened the time to 24 hours or less. Despite the update, you might not want to rely only on sound to detect AirTags. Numerous videos on YouTube offer DIY instructions to disable the speaker, and noiseless versions of the trackers were even listed for a short time on Etsy.\n\nWhat if I Find One?\n\nThe best way to disable an AirTag is to remove the battery. To do this, flip the AirTag so the metallic side with an Apple logo is facing you. Press down on the logo and turn counterclockwise. Now you will be able to remove the cover and pop out that battery.\n\nApple\u2019s support page for the AirTag suggests reaching out to the police if you believe you are in a dangerous situation. \u201cIf you feel your safety is at risk, contact your local law enforcement, who can work with Apple to request information related to the item,\u201d the support page reads. \u201cYou might need to provide the AirTag, set of AirPods, Find My network accessory, and the device's serial number.\u201d One way to figure out the serial number is to hold the top of an iPhone or other near-field-communication-enabled smartphone to the white side of an AirTag. A website with the serial number will pop up.",

So when DOGE terminated Jonathan Kamens in its agency purge, it may not have fully grasped that it was firing the security lead for the Department of Veterans Affairs website\u2014the digital hub that connects veterans with their benefits and hosts sensitive personal data, including medical records.\n\nInterviews with multiple current and former VA sources, along with veterans who now work in private-sector cybersecurity, indicate that Kamens\u2019 firing could have disastrous privacy consequences for millions of US veterans.\n\n\u201cI believe that his abrupt firing puts the security of veterans services at risk,\u201d one source with knowledge of VA systems, who was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, told WIRED about Kamens. \u201cEliminating the person responsible for the security of veteran information on VA.gov erodes the quality of the service for the veteran. It\u2019s reckless.\u201d\n\nVA.gov is what Kamens calls \u201cthe front door\u201d for all VA benefits. The site served more than 20 million registered users in the past 12 months, resulting in more than 53 million transactions. Veterans go there to access, among other things, financial, educational, health care, and death benefits. In other words, VA digital services are not only central to the lives of many veterans and their families but also a repository of deeply private information about their lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that the cybersecurity practice within VA.gov is going to suffer and that they are going to fall behind on what they are required to do in order to keep cybersecurity on VA.gov where it needs to be,\u201d Kamens says. \u201cAnd the result of that is it\u2019s going to get worse, and eventually it will get bad enough that there will be an incident.\u201d\n\nKamens was not the only person working on VA digital security and was far from the only person there who cares about safeguarding veterans' personal data. But he served a vital role in a large and important government apparatus that is notoriously strapped for resources. In particular, Kamens says, he was the only staffer working full-time on VA.gov cybersecurity and, therefore, the point person for overseeing protective upgrades and services from third-party security vendors.\n\n\u201cThis is sensitive data that in the wrong hands can do harm to people,\u201d Kamens says. \u201cThere was always too much work to do and not enough people to do it, and now all of a sudden I\u2019m gone. DOGE is all about efficiency, and that is not going to make VA more efficient.\u201d\n\nThe VA did not comment in response to WIRED's questions about changes in the cybersecurity staffing for VA.gov. In addition to cuts at USDS, more than 1,000 workers were fired from the VA itself last week. \u201cPresident Trump's looking for efficiencies so that we can do our job better,\" said secretary of veterans affairs Doug Collins in a video statement on Thursday. \u201cWhen you're doing things, you're making moves, you're making good moves, motion causes friction.\u201d",

The move represents the first major example of the country\u2019s cyberdefense agency accommodating President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud and online censorship.\n\nIn a memo sent Friday to all CISA employees and obtained by WIRED, CISA\u2019s acting director, Bridget Bean, said she was ordering \u201ca review and assessment\u201d of every position at the agency related to election security and countering mis- and disinformation, \u201cas well as every election security and [mis-, dis-, and malinformation] product, activity, service, and program that has been carried out\u201d since the federal government designated election systems as critical infrastructure in 2017.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at ericgeller.01.\n\n\u201cCISA will pause all elections security activities until the completion of this review,\u201d Bean added. The agency is also cutting off funding for these activities at the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center, a group funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that has served as a coordinating body for the elections community.\n\nIn her memo, Bean confirmed that CISA had, as first reported by Politico, placed employees \u201cinitially identified to be associated with the elections security activities and the MDM program\u201d on administrative leave on February 7.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\u201d she told employees in the memo.\n\nWhile Bean is temporarily leading CISA, she is officially the agency\u2019s executive director, its top career position. CISA\u2019s first director created the executive-director role to provide continuity during political transitions. Previously, Bean was a Trump appointee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during his first term.\n\nIn justifying CISA\u2019s internal review, which will conclude on March 6, Bean pointed to Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order on \u201cending federal censorship.\u201d Conservatives have argued that CISA censored their speech by coordinating with tech companies to identify online misinformation in 2020, during the final year of Trump\u2019s first term. CISA has denied conducting any censorship, and the US Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit over the government\u2019s work. But in the wake of the backlash, CISA halted most conversations with tech platforms about online mis- and disinformation.\n\nCISA and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince 2017, state and local election officials have relied on CISA\u2019s expertise and resources\u2014as well as its partnerships with other agencies\u2014to improve their physical and digital security. Through on-site consultations and online guidance, CISA has helped election administrators secure voting infrastructure against hackers, harden polling places against active shooters, and create polling-place backup plans to deal with ballot shortages or power outages.\n\nElection supervisors have always struggled to overcome serious funding challenges, but in recent years, their jobs have become even more stressful as intense voter scrutiny has given way to harassment and even death threats. Election officials of both parties have repeatedly praised CISA for its apolitical support of their work, saying the agency\u2019s recommendations and free security services have been critical in boosting their own efforts.",

                "text": "When the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon was revealed last fall to have deeply penetrated major US telecommunications companies\u2014ultimately breaching no fewer than nine of the phone carriers and accessing Americans' texts and calls in real time\u2014that hacking campaign was treated as a four-alarm fire by the US government. Yet even after those hackers' high-profile exposure, they've continued their spree of breaking into telecom networks worldwide, including more in the US.\n\nResearchers at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future on Wednesday night revealed in a report that they've seen Salt Typhoon breach five telecoms and internet service providers around the world, as well as more than a dozen universities from Utah to Vietnam, all between December and January. The telecoms include one US internet service provider and telecom firm and another US-based subsidiary of a UK telecom, according to the company's analysts, though they declined to name those victims to WIRED.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super active, and they continue to be super active,\u201d says Levi Gundert, who leads Recorded Future's research team known as Insikt Group. \u201cI think there's just a general under-appreciation for how aggressive they are being in turning telecommunications networks into Swiss cheese.\u201d\n\nTo carry out this latest campaign of intrusions, Salt Typhoon\u2014which Recorded Future tracks under its own name, RedMike, rather than the Typhoon handle created by Microsoft\u2014has targeted the internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco's IOS software, which runs on the networking giant's routers and switches. The hackers exploited two different vulnerabilities in those devices' code, one of which grants initial access, and another that provides root privileges, giving the hackers full control of an often powerful piece of equipment with access to a victim's network.\n\n\u201cAny time you're embedded in communication networks on infrastructure like routers, you have the keys to the kingdom in what you're able to access and observe and exfiltrate,\u201d Gundert says.\n\nRecorded Future found more than 12,000 Cisco devices whose web interfaces were exposed online, and says that the hackers targeted more than a thousand of those devices installed in networks worldwide. Of those, they appear to have focused on a smaller subset of telecoms and university networks whose Cisco devices they successfully exploited. For those selected targets, Salt Typhoon configured the hacked Cisco devices to connect to the hackers' own command-and-control servers via generic routing encapsulation, or GRE tunnels\u2014a protocol used to set up private communications channels\u2014then used those connections to maintain their access and steal data.\n\nWhen WIRED reached out to Cisco for comment, the company pointed to a security advisory it published about vulnerabilities in the web interface of its IOS software in 2023. \u201cWe continue to strongly urge customers to follow recommendations outlined in the advisory and upgrade to the available fixed software release,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in a statement.\n\nHacking network appliances as entry points to target victims\u2014often by exploiting known vulnerabilities that device owners have failed to patch\u2014has become standard operating procedure for Salt Typhoon and other Chinese hacking groups. That's in part because those network devices lack many of the security controls and monitoring software that's been extended to more traditional computing devices like servers and PCs. Recorded Future notes in its report that sophisticated Chinese espionage teams have targeted those vulnerable network appliances as a primary intrusion technique for at least five years.",

                "text": "Over the last decade, the Kremlin's most aggressive cyberwar unit, known as Sandworm, has focused its hacking campaigns on tormenting Ukraine, even more so since Russian president Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbor. Now Microsoft is warning that a team within that notorious hacking group has shifted its targeting, indiscriminately working to breach networks worldwide\u2014and, in the last year, has seemed to show a particular interest in networks in English-speaking Western countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's threat intelligence team published new research into a group within Sandworm that the company\u2019s analysts are calling BadPilot. Microsoft describes the team as an \u201cinitial access operation\u201d focused on breaching and gaining a foothold in victim networks before handing off that access to other hackers within Sandworm\u2019s larger organization, which security researchers have for years identified as a unit of Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. After BadPilot's initial breaches, other Sandworm hackers have used its intrusions to move within victim networks and carry out effects such as stealing information or launching cyberattacks, Microsoft says.\n\nMicrosoft describes BadPilot as initiating a high volume of intrusion attempts, casting a wide net and then sorting through the results to focus on particular victims. Over the last three years, the company says, the geography of the group's targeting has evolved: In 2022, it set its sights almost entirely on Ukraine, then broadened its hacking in 2023 to networks worldwide, and then shifted again in 2024 to home in on victims in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.\n\n\u201cWe see them spraying out their attempts at initial access, seeing what comes back, and then focusing on the targets they like,\u201d says Sherrod DeGrippo, Microsoft\u2019s director of threat intelligence strategy. \u201cThey\u2019re picking and choosing what makes sense to focus on. And they are focusing on those Western countries.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft didn't name any specific victims of BadPilot's intrusions, but broadly stated that the hacker group's targets have included \u201cenergy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing,\u201d and \u201cinternational governments.\u201d On at least three occasions, Microsoft says, its operations have led to data-destroying cyberattacks carried out by Sandworm against Ukrainian targets.\n\nAs for the more recent focus on Western networks, Microsoft's DeGrippo hints that the group's interests have likely been more related to politics. \u201cGlobal elections are probably a reason for that,\u201d DeGrippo says. \u201cThat changing political landscape, I think, is a motivator to change tactics and to change targets.\u201d\n\nOver the more than three years that Microsoft has tracked BadPilot, the group has sought to gain access to victim networks using known but unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-facing software, exploiting hackable flaws in Microsoft Exchange and Outlook, as well as applications from OpenFire, JetBrains, and Zimbra. In its targeting of Western networks over the last year in particular, Microsoft warns that BadPilot has specifically exploited a vulnerability in the remote access tool Connectwise ScreenConnect and Fortinet FortiClient EMS, another application for centrally managing Fortinet's security software on PCs.\n\nAfter exploiting those vulnerabilities, Microsoft found that BadPilot typically installs software that gives it persistent access to a victim machine, often with legitimate remote access tools like Atera Agent or Splashtop Remote Services. In some cases, in a more unique twist, it also sets up a victim's computer to run as so-called onion service on the Tor anonymity network, essentially turning it into a server that communicates via Tor's collection of proxy machines to hide its communications.",

                "text": "Breeze Liu\u2019s online nightmare started with a phone call. In April 2020, a college classmate rang Liu, then 24 years old, to tell her an explicit video of her was on PornHub under the title \u201cKorean teen.\u201d Liu alleges it had been filmed without her permission when she was 17 and uploaded without her consent.\n\nOver time, the video mushroomed and multiplied: it was saved, posted on other porn websites and, Liu claims, used to create intimate deepfake videos that spread across the web. The impact on Liu was profound. \u201cI honestly had to struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I almost killed myself,\u201d she says.\n\nWiping around 400 nonconsensual images and videos from the web would require a multiyear, intercontinental effort. During this time, Liu went from working as a venture capitalist to starting her own company to help fight digital abuse. But when dealing with her own content, the entrepreneur faced a wall of silence and continual delays from one of the internet\u2019s biggest gatekeepers: Microsoft.\n\nAs images and videos are published on websites like PornHub, they\u2019re often hosted on cloud infrastructure. A series of emails related to Liu\u2019s case reviewed by WIRED, plus interviews with a French victims\u2019 aid organization and other advocates working with her, show how Microsoft, despite repeated pleas, did not remove about 150 explicit images of Liu stored on its Azure cloud services. While other companies took down hundreds of images, Liu and a colleague say Microsoft only took action after the two confronted a senior member of the tech giant\u2019s safety team at a content moderation conference.\n\nThe drawn-out process, which prolonged the emotional toll on Liu, provides a detailed illustration of the difficulties victims and survivors of intimate image abuse experience in trying to erase the content from the web. Liu\u2019s ordeal also highlights the void some victims fall into when their age in the imagery is disputed or hard to discern, an overlooked problem that may become more pressing as nudify apps spread in high schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for ordinary people to navigate the complex system and do damage control,\u201d Liu says. While she has shared parts of her struggle before, many of the details in this story and the resolution of Microsoft\u2019s prolonged failure to remove the intimate images have not been previously reported. \u201cWe\u2019re facing an extremely broken system, and this is a global issue,\u201d Liu says. \u201cThis is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nCourtney Gregoire, Microsoft\u2019s chief digital safety officer, says the company has learned from miscommunications in Liu\u2019s case and doesn\u2019t want anyone to go through the agonizing experience she did. \u201cThis content is a priority area where we endeavor to be actioning within 12 hours,\u201d Gregoire says. For Liu, the grueling process took eight months.\n\nAfter being alerted to the first nonconsensual video of her online in April 2020, Liu says, it took her a whole day to calm down. On May 14 of that year, she contacted the Berkeley Police Department, where she lived in California at the time.",

                "text": "You've seen the bikes around your neighborhood. They look like so much fun! You want one! But ebikes have so many different specs and price points. Here's what I would consider, in your position.\n\nCan I build my own bike?\n\nMany affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer\u2014meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flax recently noted in Bicycling magazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network. I also do not recommend a smart ebike. As we can see with VanMoof's recent implosion, you may have difficulty getting your smart ebike repaired if the company folds.\n\nWhy do some bikes cost more?\n\nThey have higher-end components. Batteries and motors from high-end brands like Bosch and Shimano often are more powerful and cover more distance, with a 90- or 120-mile range, as compared to the 15-20 mile ranges you'll see on more affordable bikes. However, this may not matter if you have a short commute.\n\nWhat terrain do you live on?\n\nIf you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic.\n\nI would also look for a mid-drive motor instead of a hub-drive motor. Mid-drive motors are located in the center of your bike and feel more natural. A hub drive is on your rear axle and shifts your center of gravity backward, which takes some getting used to. It can throw you off balance when you're going up steep hills.\n\nFollow some basic safety tips.\n\nNot sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes recently released their safety education program, E-Bike Smart, which they created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado. Do not leave your bike battery charging overnight, and do not let your children ride your bike unsupervised. An 80-pound child should not be piloting a 65-pound bike, even if the motor makes it possible for them to do so.",

                "text": "There are a lot of great soundbars out there, and we don\u2019t have room to feature them all. Here are some others you might want to consider.\n\nLG's S95TR for $1,000-1,300: LG's 9.1.5-channel soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't perform as well as Samsung's flagship Q990 series, but it could be a better choice for those with newer LG TVs like the C4, which can connect wirelessly and use its speakers in tandem with the bar for more immersion. It also supports gaming features like 120-Hz pass-through, but only includes one spare input.\n\nVizio 2.1 Soundbar (SV210M) for $170: Vizio\u2019s curvy little combo brings enticing value, with solid sound quality and some cinematic punch from the teensiest subwoofer you\u2019ll ever see. There\u2019s no optical input or remote included, but the Vizio app makes adjusting settings or swapping to Bluetooth simple enough. The main drawback is that dialog sometimes (but not always) gets lost, reducing the main draw of a cheap soundbar. That said, good musical chops and features like DTS Virtual X expansion make it worth considering on sale.\n\nSamsung HW-Q800C for $598: If Samsung's HW-Q990C everything bar is too rich for your blood, the two-piece HW-Q800C (WIRED Recommends, 8/10) could be a good compromise. This bar offers a similar sound signature as Samsung's flagship bars many of the same features, packed into a smaller bar-and-subwoofer combo for a notable discount\u2013especially since it's now almost always on sale.\n\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $700: This pint-sized luxury bar is great for those with money to burn in very small spaces. Sennheiser's built-in Ambeo virtualization technology brilliantly throws sound all around you for exhilarating TV and movies, and offers advanced features like support for Google Assistant and Alexa.\n\nSony HT-X8500 for $300: Sony's HT-X8500 is getting harder to find, but it's still one of our favorite options for those after a single bar with solid bass response and expansive sound, including decent Dolby Atmos virtualization. While it's pricier than our top bar, it's a great alternative for those after a bit more, and worth considering while it's still available.\n\nRoku Streambar for $130: If you\u2019re after a soundbar that doubles as a great streaming device, WIRED reviewer Adrienne So swears by the Roku Streambar. After she spent years without one she was so impressed that she shouted it from the rooftops. Setup is easy, and because it includes Roku\u2019s simple streaming interface you can stream movies and shows at up to 4K HDR from just about every streaming service. You can also add a Roku subwoofer or surround-sound speakers down the line. We encourage getting a sub.\n\nVizio Elevate M-Series for $500: If you want full-featured Dolby Atmos and you like a bit of flair, Vizio's second Elevate bar is worth considering. Drivers pop out of the side and aim toward your ceiling when Atmos content is playing, giving it a nifty party trick to show your pals. Sound quality is solid too, and we like the compact design and easy setup. However, you will have to route some speaker cables for the rear surrounds.\n\nThe Yamaha SR-C30A for $276: This model SR-C30A soundbar looks very similar indeed to the SR-C20A, and that\u2019s because they\u2019re the same thing where dimensions, specification, and sound quality are all concerned. The difference is that the SR-C30A ships with a compact (335 x 160 x 364mm) wireless subwoofer for some authentic Hollywood-style rumble and punch. \u2014Simon Lucas\n\nSennheiser Ambeo Plus for $1,200: Given the price and the physical dimensions of the soundbar\u2014which doesn't even include a subwoofer\u2014the Ambeo Plus might look like a poor deal. But thanks to its 400 watts of power and its nine carefully developed and even more carefully positioned speaker drivers, this Sennheiser is capable of big, enveloping sound with a strong suggestion of the sonic height that Dolby Atmos soundtracks thrive on. By way of an encore, it turns out to be a hugely capable wireless speaker when you want to listen to some music, too. \u2014Simon Lucas\n\nThe Polk React for $269: This soundbar works if you want to get surround sound eventually but don\u2019t have the cash right now. The Alexa-enabled soundbar is fine on its own, with surround speakers and subwoofers available from Polk if you want to upgrade.\n\nThe Vizio Elevate P-Series for $700: This is an awesome-looking soundbar with side speakers that swivel skyward when you\u2019re watching content with object-based audio. It\u2019s a nice-sounding bar, and that gimmick is neat, but there are better options for under $1,000.",

To help you navigate the dozens of models from Samsung, LG, TCL, Hisense, Sony, Panasonic, and others, we've done intensive testing and watched hundreds of hours of content to grab the standouts from our recent reviews. Below you'll find everything from the top TV we've tested to the best sets on a tight budget\u2014with plenty of excellent options in between.\n\nAll of these models have a minimum 4K Ultra HD resolution (one has 8K) with HDR, because there's no good reason to buy a standard HDTV beyond a pint-size model for your kitchen or small bedroom. Every TV on our list comes with a wonderful display, but most are bad at sound and can have lackluster interfaces, so you should consider investing in a good soundbar or pair of bookshelf speakers and a streaming stick.

I am very demure.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWhy is Druski in 2K?\n\nWhat are you guys saying?\n\nI'm not an athlete.\n\nHuh?\n\nIs that what it is?\n\nAll right, I get it.\n\nI'm in 2K because I can play basketball.\n\nIt's pretty obvious.\n\nLook at my build.\n\nWhy is Druski on the news?\n\nI'm a smart guy.\n\nI'm sorry, man.\n\nBut a lot of people think comedians are dumb.\n\nWe're not.\n\nWe're smart people.\n\nYes, I was on MSNBC.\n\nI also been on amongst the other news channels as well.\n\nThey asked me about serious topics all the time.\n\nSo why is Druski so funny?\n\nHey, man, we ain't all born with this shit,\n\nbut some of us is, so you get it.\n\n[Druski laughing]\n\nWhy does Druski wear ski goggles?\n\nThat phase is over for me.\n\nYou guys can stop googling that bullshit.\n\nI'm done wearing ski goggles.\n\nYou guys have bullied me\n\nin to forgetting about even ever fucking doing that again.\n\nAll right.\n\nHow did Druski get his name?\n\nA friend in middle school started to call me Druski\n\nwhich was inspired by a show called\n\nCollege Hill at the time.\n\nYeah, if you've seen College Hill,\n\nit's like a black show.\n\nSo for all the white people in here, it was a,\n\nyou guys probably definitely have never seen College Hill.\n\nWell, the one where the guy's name was Druski, at least.\n\nHow did Druski meet Willie?\n\nHmm.\n\nThat's a great white question.\n\nWillie is a interesting guy from\n\nthe boonies of Alabama.\n\nHe naturally was a funny guy on the internet.\n\nHe always made funny videos and I reached out to him\n\nand we linked up\n\nand it naturally was probably the best\n\nsituation I've ever gotten myself into.\n\nSo if you've seen any of the videos, look it up.\n\nBubba Joe Roll Todd Willie videos, yeah.\n\nHow did Druski and Jack Harlow meet?\n\nDamn, one of us DM'd each other.\n\nWe figured out that we were both fans of each other.\n\nHe had music that I enjoyed at the time.\n\nOf course, he enjoyed my comedy at the time,\n\nand I think naturally we just clicked, man.\n\nAnd then I asked him, I was like, yo, where do you stay?\n\nHe said, I stay in Atlanta and sent the address,\n\nand it was like two minutes down the street.\n\nSo Match made in Heaven, yeah.\n\nHow does Druski come up with skits?\n\nI'd probably say just living life\n\nand just being around funny shit.\n\nAlways surrounding myself with funny people.\n\nI grew up around a funny family.\n\nI just, for some reason,\n\nthe world always involves me in funny scenarios, so that's\n\nhow I come up with material and it just never ends.\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nAll right.\n\nWho is Druski DoorDash girl?\n\nWho's asking these questions, man?\n\nIs it kids?\n\nIs kids on this doing this?\n\nWhat is this?\n\nWho's the Door Dash girl from what?\n\nThese kids gotta get off the internet, man.\n\nIt's getting weird.\n\nWho won Druski Could Have Been House?\n\nOne of my favorite artists at the label did\n\nUgliest Rapper Alive.\n\nHe won, Could Have Been House,\n\nand we ended up getting the dental plan going for him.\n\nWe fixed his teeth.\n\nSo he's on the up\n\nand come up in line, man, go check him out.\n\nUgliest Rapper Alive, he's a great guy.\n\nHe's a great guy and he's very motivated\n\nand we just wanted a reason to be able to fix his teeth.\n\nSo we gave him the money.\n\nThat's point blink, period.\n\nAll right guys, so what do you mean by that Druski?\n\nThese are definitely kids on the internet.\n\nGuys get the fuck off TikTok kids.\n\nSeriously, it's getting weird.\n\nWhat is Druski's favorite comedy skit?\n\nMm mm, I think any one of my skits where I can really\n\nget into character in like, it is an undescribable feeling.\n\nIt's like a goosebump feeling you get when you're like\n\nin character and you know, like, all right, this is,\n\nthis is good.\n\nSo any, it is no particular one,\n\nbut, you know, sometimes you get that feeling.\n\nYou don't always get it but if you play a certain character,\n\nthe improv actors of and the actors of the world know\n\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\nYou get it and if you don't, it's just,\n\nit just might not be your call.\n\nPut it down, buddy.\n\nThat's just not next one.\n\nAll right.\n\nDruski standing on business.\n\nYou're damn right.\n\nAnd as always, I have,\n\nI actually appreciate you googling that man.\n\nNot sure why he did it, but\n\nyou are right about that statement.\n\nIt wasn't a question, I'll tell you that Druski, Kevin Hart,\n\nKai Cenat movie.\n\nMm, it's on the way.\n\nWe are in the works, man, and I'm super excited.\n\nI always looked up to Kevin Hart,\n\nloved Kai Cenat's work from the Jump, became friends\n\nwith these two guys, man.\n\nAnd we've made a dope trio\n\nand I'm super excited for what we have in store.\n\nDruski Hummer, parked outside.\n\nParked outside.\n\nThese are definitely kids typing this stuff,\n\nbut yes, I have a Camel Hummer\n\nwith bullhorns on the front.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet you should check it out.\n\nDruski fits.\n\nBoy, yes, I am fit.\n\nI'm a bit in shape, so right about that, man.\n\nI've been going to the gym lately.\n\n[Speaker] Fits can also be fashion.\n\nOh, I thought they was asking.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt makes sense.\n\nI am fashionable.\n\nI'm very demure.\n\nI think I've always had a fashionable sense\n\nin my own world since growing up.\n\nI always got in trouble for wearing, you know,\n\nopen toe sandals\n\nand stuff back when I was in elementary, middle school.\n\nAnd it just carried on throughout life, man.\n\nAnd, but yeah, this applies for both.\n\nI think I'm fit in shape\n\nand I can dress, so it's a long one.\n\nDoes Druski actually have a record label?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd if you don't know about it, get to searching buddy.\n\nWe're actually number one, and that's just\n\nbecause we're upfront and honest with our artists.\n\nWe let 'em know when stuff sucks.\n\nWe let 'em know when it's good.\n\nMajority of the time, any of our artists, their music sucks,\n\nbut we up their entertainment value.\n\nThat's what it is.\n\nThe entertainment value.\n\nDruski dancing Kai Cenat.\n\nYeah, guys, it's not making much sense.\n\nYes, I can dance\n\nand I do have a dance right now\n\nthat is pretty everywhere that people enjoy.\n\nSo I don't know what the kids are watching these days.\n\nWell, Druski falling.\n\nWell that's typical.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff out there in me falling.\n\nI actually fell on stage on my first tour.\n\nI fell on stage on some steps.\n\nWe had a step, I'm still mad at that guy\n\nfor setting up stage like that.\n\nYeah, it was actually pretty bad injury.\n\nI came on stage the next night in a wheelchair\n\nand then following those\n\nperformances I had, I was in a boot.\n\nI pushed through though, man.\n\nThat's what it's about.\n\nConsistency, man.\n\nIt's all about consistency.\n\nDruski getting roasted.\n\nIt's been happening my whole life, man.\n\nIt's only a matter of time you get roasted,\n\nthen you become the king of that shit.\n\nKids hang in there.\n\nYour time's coming, but it gets bad first.\n\nIt all gets bad first man,\n\nand then you congratulate\n\nas it goes on, man, life gets better.\n\nI have no idea what that came from,\n\nfrom roasted, but fuck it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI appreciated this.\n\nThis was great.\n\nHonestly, I loved all your Googleable questions\n\nand statements.\n\nThat was really good, a bit pointless, but good nonetheless.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Dr. Christina Madison, a clinical pharmacist.\n\nI'm here to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Pharmacology Support.\n\n[energetic music]\n\npurrrcell would like to know, What is it about grapefruit\n\nthat makes it so dangerous\n\nto mix with so many medications?\n\nLike damn.\n\nGrapefruit goes through the liver.\n\nIt's part of something\n\ncalled the cytochrome P450 system.\n\nWhat that means is that it can disrupt\n\nthe metabolism of medications,\n\nit can alter the absorption of that drug,\n\nmeaning that more of the drug\n\nwill remain in your bloodstream\n\nand you'll be more likely to experience the toxicity\n\nassociated with that drug and experience side effects.\n\ntechwithtaz asks, Expiration dates on medications.\n\nAre they similar to a best by situation or what?\n\nAny hot takes?\n\nExpiration dates are what we know to be safe and effective.\n\nYour expiration date is a guidepost.\n\nI like the term best by,\n\nbut ultimately there are some drugs\n\nthat if you don't use them by their expiration date,\n\nthey can become toxic.\n\nAn example of this is doxycycline.\n\nDoxycycline starts to break down,\n\nand the chemical that's left\n\ncan be very toxic to you if you ingest it.\n\nMost medications, however, do not become toxic.\n\nThey reduce their efficacy.\n\nYou may have to take more,\n\nwhich means you possibly could take an inaccurate dose\n\nor have an overdose\n\nbecause you're taking more medication that's needed\n\nbecause it's not as effective.\n\nSo the key here is, whenever possible,\n\nplease try not to take any expired medications.\n\neSHODAN would like to know, Why is botulinum toxin,\n\nthe most lethal toxin known,\n\npurposefully injected into humans\n\nfor cosmetic surgeries, such as Botox?\n\nIs there nothing else that could be used?\n\nBotulinum toxin, in the environment, yes, can be very toxic.\n\nHowever, what we currently use for therapeutic uses,\n\nlike cosmetic purposes\n\nor for things like migraine headaches,\n\nis a very small dose that's targeted,\n\nlocalized, and causes limited effects.\n\nIt's gonna cause localized paralysis, so no more wrinkles,\n\nbut the toxin itself is not gonna get into my bloodstream\n\nand cause me to be sick or ill.\n\nZarithe asks, How exactly do extended release pills work?\n\nSo there's a few different things going on here.\n\nOral medications are unique in the fact\n\nthat they may undergo\n\nsomething called first pass metabolism.\n\nSo medications are comprised of chemicals\n\ntransformed through actions of our body.\n\nSo one of the ways that that happens\n\nis through first pass metabolism\n\nwhere it gets metabolized in the liver.\n\nThe chemical structure that is left\n\nafter it goes through that process is called a substrate.\n\nSo some of the time what we do\n\nin order to make the medication last longer\n\nis that we use a precursor to that substrate,\n\nwhich allows for the main medication\n\nor the active ingredient to get metabolized\n\nafter first pass metabolism\n\nand become the active medication.\n\nThe other thing too that we can do to extend the likelihood\n\nor the length of duration of therapy\n\nis going to be using a different type of container\n\nto hold the medication.\n\nThere's tablets, there's capsules,\n\nall different types of coatings that can go over the tablet\n\nthat allow for it to be dissolved or metabolized more slowly\n\nonce it hits the acid of your stomach.\n\nFrom OhCoco, I don't think people understand\n\nhow dangerous it is taking Tylenol regularly.\n\nMost over-the-counter medications are safe\n\nand effective when used as directed.\n\nHowever, Tylenol can be toxic, specifically to your liver.\n\nSo there is a maximum amount of Tylenol\n\nthat you should consume within a 24-hour period.\n\nThe max is four grams.\n\nHowever, for safety, most pharmacists would tell you\n\nyou really shouldn't take more than three grams\n\nwithin a 24-hour period\n\nin order to avoid any injury or toxicity to your liver.\n\nThe reason why this is important\n\nis because there's so many different over-the-counter cough\n\nand cold preparations\n\nthat contain the active ingredient in Tylenol,\n\nwhich is called acetaminophen.\n\nSo if you've got cough and cold preparation over here\n\nand then you have some regular Tylenol over here,\n\nyou have to add the two together and make sure\n\nit doesn't go over that three gram in a day limit.\n\nTheOnlyOneLeft would like to know,\n\nWhy do some vaccines require a booster shot\n\na few weeks later after the first one?\n\nThere's a couple of reasons why this may occur.\n\nThe first is whether or not the person\n\nhas been exposed to the vaccination in the past.\n\nFor example, most childhood vaccinations\n\nrequire lots of booster doses\n\nbecause it's new to their immune system\n\nand we want them to develop an appropriate response.\n\nSame thing with the influenza vaccine\n\nor the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOnce you receive it, we're basically priming the pump,\n\nand then we give you a booster\n\nin order for your immune system to be able to recognize it\n\nif it sees it in the environment.\n\nFrom Ok-Access-3286, How do y'all count your pills?\n\nEasy, by five.\n\nFrom WinSad5408, Is it beneficial to get HPV vaccine\n\nafter you have HPV?\n\nThe quick answer is, absolutely.\n\nHPV or human papilloma virus is a type of infection\n\nthat can just be transmitted from skin to skin,\n\nand it is the leading cause of cervical cancer,\n\nvulva, vaginal cancer, penile cancer, and anal cancer,\n\nas well as genital warts.\n\nAll of those are caused\n\nby different strains of the HPV virus.\n\n6 and 11 have been associated with genital warts.\n\n16 and 18 have been associated with cervical cancers\n\nand other types of cancers,\n\nincluding anal cancer and penile cancer.\n\nThe vaccine that we have now\n\nhas multiple strains that it protects against.\n\nSo even if you've had HPV,\n\nyou've probably only had one, maybe two, of those strains,\n\nand you can be still protected by the other strains\n\nthat are included in the current vaccination.\n\nTobyTheRobot asks,\n\nHow does a pharmaceutical company come up with new drugs?\n\nDo they just try various chemicals on animals\n\nuntil something shows promise?\n\nPharmaceutical companies take a lot of pride\n\nin their research and development.\n\nIt costs millions of dollars\n\nin order for them to develop a new drug.\n\nIt can come from natural sources,\n\nit can come from synthetic compounds or chemicals.\n\nTypically it's done from clinical trial work\n\nlooking at compounds that have been known\n\nto cause therapeutic effects in other disease states,\n\nand then we try it and see if it works in others.\n\nIt's not really this what you're saying\n\nthrow it at the wall and see if it sticks.\n\nNext is Funny-Reputation-454,\n\nFavorite animal-derive-drug fact.\n\nOne of the things that we know\n\nwhen we think about drug development and drug discovery\n\nis that a lot of the medications derive from venoms\n\nor toxins that are produced by animals\n\nor biological sources like viruses and bacteria.\n\nOne of our popular diabetes medications\n\ncomes from the saliva of a Gila monster.\n\nSo one of my favorite animal-derived drugs\n\nis from Gila monster spit.\n\nnotcornemoji would like to know,\n\nWhy does DoorDash need my ID for cold meds?\n\nLOL. What do you think I'm going to do with it?\n\nCough and cold preparations\n\nmay include an active ingredient called pseudoephedrine.\n\nThose medications,\n\neven though they're technically considered over-the-counter,\n\nwould be behind-the-counter in the pharmacy.\n\nThe reason for this is that we have to document\n\nhow much pseudoephedrine you're purchasing on a daily basis.\n\nSeems strange, right?\n\nWhy would I need to know how much pseudoephedrine\n\nyou're buying in a day?\n\nBefore we had this restriction,\n\npseudo ephedrine was being used\n\nto fuel the methamphetamine processing\n\nin different areas of the country.\n\nWe need to keep track of who's purchasing it\n\nin order to hopefully stem the production\n\nof illegal drug production.\n\nSo the reason why we have this requirement\n\nis so that we don't have more meth labs.\n\ncroyceltic, Alexa, show me how penicillin was discovered.\n\nDr. Fleming discovered it in 1928.\n\nHe's a Scottish biologist\n\nthat was working in a hospital in London\n\nand discovered after looking at a Petri dish\n\nthat had some mold growing on it\n\nthat the staphylococcus that was on that Petri dish\n\nwas not growing in the place where the mold was.\n\nUltimately, we discovered\n\none of the most powerful antibiotics by mistake.\n\nZarataroVT would like to know,\n\nIs melatonin dependency bad? Asking for me.\n\nSo the first thing is is that melatonin,\n\nyou can't really become dependent on melatonin.\n\nHowever, too much melatonin can be a bad thing.\n\nThere was an instance about a year ago\n\nwhere several children became sick or ill\n\nbecause of overdoses of melatonin\n\nfrom the use of melatonin gummies.\n\nIt really should not be used on a regular basis.\n\nYou should not be using this continuously for a sleep aid.\n\nCindyHendren2 would like to know,\n\nWhy hasn't a cure for the common cold been found?\n\nThe common cold is often caused by a rhinovirus.\n\nHowever, there's been 200 separate viruses and organisms\n\nthat have been attributed to the causes of the common cold.\n\nThat's a lot of different causes.\n\nSo it does make a bit of a moving target.\n\nIn addition to rhinoviruses,\n\nthe common cold can also be caused\n\nby coronaviruses, like COVID-19,\n\nas well as respiratory syncytial virus and RSV.\n\nAnd the good news is,\n\nis although we may not have a cure for those,\n\nwe do have a vaccine for them.\n\nSo when in doubt, get your vaccines.\n\nMarketTanker, What do pharmacists actually do though\n\nthat require five years training?\n\nDoctors prescribe medicine, and last time I went,\n\nall the pharmacist did was tell me\n\nnot to take more than dosage required.\n\nI could have read that easily myself from the leaflet.\n\nI am a pharmacist who went to school for many years,\n\nincluding a clinical residency,\n\nand I will tell you, we do a lot more\n\nthan just stand behind the counter.\n\nWe are the medication experts.\n\nBack there behind the counter,\n\nwe're gonna be doing a whole bunch of other things\n\nthat you probably don't get a chance to see,\n\nlike checking for drug interactions,\n\nmaking sure that the drug that's being prescribed\n\nis actually used for that disease state,\n\nand most importantly, checking it to make sure\n\nthat it's appropriate for you, the patient,\n\nand that it's safe for you to take.\n\nbunnytsumu would like to know,\n\nIf I drink alcohol whilst on antibiotics, will I die?\n\nQuick answer is no. However, it depends.\n\nFirst of all, how much alcohol are you drinking?\n\n'Cause alcohol toxicity can be pretty bad.\n\nWhen we're just looking at alcohol and antibiotics together,\n\nthe key here is that there are some agents\n\nthat you can get really sick from taking with alcohol.\n\nSo one of those is something called metronidazole,\n\nwhich is an anti-infective,\n\nand it will make you violently ill\n\nif you take it with alcohol.\n\nAnother medication, say penicillin,\n\nif you take that with alcohol,\n\nit may make the penicillin less effective\n\nbecause it's altering your gut.\n\nRule of thumb, just don't drink until you feel better.\n\nSummerEllenLane would like to know,\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of Ozempic?\n\nThe original use of this medication was to treat diabetes,\n\nand then they realized, in addition to lowering blood sugar,\n\nit also caused people to lose weight,\n\nit improved their cardiac health,\n\nit reduced their cholesterol,\n\nit improved their kidney function,\n\nif they had kidney problems associated with their diabetes,\n\nalso, it's being looked at potentially\n\nfor Alzheimer's disease,\n\nand it was recently FDA approved to treat sleep apnea.\n\nThis drug, for all intensive purposes,\n\nseems like a miracle cure.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides.\n\nThat can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite.\n\nLoss of appetite sounds like it could be a good thing,\n\nespecially if you're trying to lose weight.\n\nHowever, the weight comes from everywhere,\n\nand not only do you lose fat, but you lose muscle as well.\n\nBlonde_Icon wants to know,\n\nWhy aren't more drugs that aren't very dangerous\n\nor addictive available over the counter,\n\nlike antidepressants or weight loss drugs,\n\nlike Ozempic or Wegovy?\n\nThere are two sets of medications\n\nthat we currently have available in the United States,\n\nthose that require FDA approval\n\nand those that have been deemed safe and effective\n\nwithout the direction of a doctor or a medical provider,\n\nand those are over-the-counter medications.\n\nThe other thing too is that an over-the-counter medication\n\nalso has to have a low risk of being addictive,\n\nhabit forming, or dangerous.\n\nEach medication that is considered over-the-counter\n\nmust go through a rigorous safety check.\n\nThe reason for this is that once you have something\n\nthat is over-the-counter, you can take that medication\n\nas directed with no additional consultation by a pharmacist\n\nor another healthcare professional.\n\nBased on that, there are a lot of medications that we have\n\nthat are over-the-counter,\n\nbut the ones that are prescription that are being looked at\n\nto go over-the-counter,\n\nan example of this would be our allergy medications.\n\nSo before the 2000s, things like Claritin, Allegra,\n\nthose types of allergy medications,\n\nthose were previously prescription medications,\n\nbut then were deemed safe enough\n\nto be able to be over-the-counter.\n\n1hyacinthe asks, Why are there so many TV ads\n\nfor plaque psoriasis?\n\nDirect to consumer advertising\n\nfor prescription medications is only something that occurs\n\nhere in the US and New Zealand.\n\nEvery other industrialized country\n\ndoes not allow direct-to-consumer advertising\n\nto the patient.\n\nThe reason why it seems like there's so many ads\n\nis because this law changed in the late 1990s,\n\nand it allowed for pharmaceutical companies\n\nto directly market their products to the patient.\n\nThis has caused some challenges within the healthcare system\n\nbecause everyone feels\n\nlike they may have that certain condition.\n\nNow, going back to specifically plaque psoriasis,\n\nthis is a condition that does not have a lot of medications\n\nthat are effective to treat it,\n\nas well as the fact that the medication that are used\n\nare only available as brand name medications.\n\nNow, from the pharmaceutical company standpoint,\n\nit works for them because now they're marketing\n\na very expensive drug that they're going to now profit from.\n\nSo you're gonna keep seeing\n\nmore plaque psoriasis commercials\n\nuntil we come up with the generic\n\nand the profit margins are less.\n\nniifG would like to know,\n\nPharmacists, what mistakes have you made?\n\nI like to say I'm a work in progress,\n\nbut one of the things that I will never forget\n\nwas a mistake that I made working as an intern\n\nat a pharmacy when I was still in pharmacy school.\n\nI had an elderly patient who came in\n\nto pick up their prescription for acyclovir,\n\nthe medication that can be used for genital herpes.\n\nIt's also used to treat shingles.\n\nI did not ask the question,\n\nwhat did your doctor tell you this medication was for?\n\nSo I mistakenly started telling\n\nthis very kind elderly gentleman\n\nhow this medication would help treat his genital warts.\n\nUnfortunately, he was there to pick it up\n\nto treat his shingles.\n\nI never made that mistake again.\n\nRoxa97 would like to know,\n\nWhat was considered medicine in the 18th century?\n\nSo according to the American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy,\n\nduring the Revolutionary War and colonial times,\n\nthe 17 and 1800s, most of the drugs that were being used\n\nwere to facilitate things like purging, depletion, bleeding,\n\nand things that we used back then would include camphor,\n\nopium, and emetics in order to get people to purge things\n\nthat they no longer wanted in their bodies.\n\nbowiesbody would like to know,\n\nAs most, I do wonder why there's so many drug shortages.\n\nThey're all so random too.\n\nADHD medications, hydrocortisone, some benzos,\n\nmagnesium citrate laxatives,\n\nlike, what's happening in big pharma HQ?\n\nThe quick answer is, it's complicated.\n\nNumber one, quality.\n\nSo if there's something wrong with the quality of the batch\n\nof that medication, it will have to be remade.\n\nNumber two, if the raw components\n\nof that particular medication are backordered\n\nor not available, this could delay production.\n\nNumber three, delay of the product.\n\nNumber four, problems with distribution\n\ndue to increase in demand.\n\nAnd last, but not least, number five,\n\nnot having profitability.\n\nThis often happens with generic medications,\n\nand so the manufacturers will either reduce\n\nor completely stop making the drug\n\nbecause it's no longer profitable to them.\n\nFrom api_assassin, What is pharmacology,\n\nand what do you enjoy about its study?\n\nPharmacology is the study of drugs,\n\ntheir mechanism of action, how they work on the body,\n\nas well as how the body works on drugs.\n\nPharmacology is a great thing for us\n\nbecause modern medicine shows us\n\nthat if we didn't have medications,\n\na lot more of us wouldn't be able to survive.\n\nMost importantly, in something like vaccinations,\n\nwhich is the single most effective medical intervention\n\nthat we've had within our history,\n\nwe know that there are thousands and thousands of children\n\nthat would not survive if it wasn't for childhood vaccines.\n\nTommyWeb3Cr would like to know,\n\nHow can AI assist in drug discovery\n\nand accelerating the development of new medications?\n\nThat can help identify new potential drug targets,\n\ncan also help us repurpose existing drug targets,\n\ndetermining what clinical trial participants are appropriate\n\nfor a given study, and last, but not least,\n\nit can help us synthesize mass amounts of data,\n\nand this is gonna help us further identify new drugs\n\nthat we can use to cure old diseases.\n\nThat's it. Hope you learned something new.\n\nThose are all our questions for Pharmacology Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHey guys.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nHello.\n\nYes, I'm WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs,\n\nand I'm thrilled to be joined today by the CEO\n\nof the hottest social network of the moment, Jay Graber.\n\nBefore Jay was the CEO of Bluesky,\n\nshe founded a social platform\n\nand she also was vital to the development\n\nof the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash.\n\nSo she's done a real tour of Silicon Valley activities\n\nand yeah, it's gonna be great.\n\nThanks for being here.\n\nThanks for having me, Kate.\n\nYeah, so I joined Bluesky about a year ago,\n\nand at the time it was still invite only\n\nand it was, you know, really, really popular\n\namongst a certain community,\n\nbut recently it's completely exploded\n\nand grown exponentially.\n\nHow many users are on there now?\n\nWe crossed 24 million recently.\n\nAmazing.\n\nAnd since it's grown so much,\n\nI'm curious if you can explain to anyone\n\nwho is still unfamiliar with the platform,\n\nwhat distinguishes Bluesky from its competitors?\n\nYeah, so Bluesky's really focused on user choice.\n\nWe try to give users a choice in their experience,\n\ndevelopers the freedom to build,\n\nand creators the ability\n\nto own their relationship with their audience.\n\nAnd so the way that we do that\n\nis it's built on an open network underneath.\n\nAnd that means that there's lots of experiences\n\nthat you can have on Bluesky.\n\nYou can customize your feed, you can control what you see,\n\nyou can control how other people interact with you.\n\nThere's a lot of tooling under the hood for that.\n\nAnd so that means that it's a better experience for people\n\nand ultimately that's what we're trying to provide.\n\nAnd, you know, it is a crowded playing field\n\nand you are emerging as like a new star.\n\nI'm wondering why do you think, you know, it was,\n\nthe world was so ready for innovation in this space?\n\nYeah, well social has gotten kind of stagnant\n\nover the years.\n\nWhen you have really strong network effects\n\nand people feel like they can't leave\n\nand there's no alternative,\n\nthen innovation kind of comes to a halt.\n\nAlso, the social companies have closed down the ability\n\nfor developers to build on them.\n\nAnd so stuff that used to happen,\n\nlike people building, you know, TweetDeck back in the day,\n\nstuff like that, doesn't really happen anymore.\n\nAnd so what we've done is opened that back up again.\n\nSo developers are building new things\n\nand users are coming in and finding out that,\n\nhey, you can do things differently here.\n\nYou can have a model of a social network\n\nthat lets you be social again\n\nand isn't, you know, having a for-you feed\n\nthat just shows you what the algorithm wants you to see.\n\nThere's the ability for you to go in\n\nand search for whatever you want,\n\nsee whatever you wanna see,\n\nand if you can't find it, you can go build it.\n\nI really, really appreciate that the search bar\n\ndoesn't say anything about AI.\n\nI thank you for that.\n\nIs there anything that, you know,\n\npeople, developers, or other people in the Bluesky community\n\nare doing that's especially exciting to you?\n\nYeah, there's a lot of stuff that's been built\n\nthat's really cool and that we're seeing for the first time.\n\nOne of them is starter packs.\n\nSo people are using this tool we built\n\nto connect with each other.\n\nAnd so if you want to bring your friend on, you can add,\n\nyou know, your hundred most recommended accounts\n\nor however many you want to a starter pack\n\nand then give that link to your friend\n\nor even put up a QR code and give that to people.\n\nAnd so that means that people\n\nare able to find their network very quickly.\n\nThe other thing people have done is\n\nthey've built tons of custom feeds.\n\nAnd so that means that if you are just looking\n\nfor maybe cat pictures today, that's all you wanna see.\n\n[Kate] I, that's usually me.\n\nYeah, you can search for that\n\nor you can just install a feed\n\nthat just shows you cat pictures.\n\nPeople have built multiple of these.\n\nAnd so this gives people a way to customize their experience\n\nmore than they've ever been able to do before.\n\nThat is amazing.\n\nAnd I think there was a QR code showing a starter pack.\n\nHopefully you guys all held your phones up and got that.\n\nBut, yeah, it's, I love the starter packs.\n\nThat's kind of, I know WIRED has one.\n\nYeah, there we go. There we go.\n\nSo, one of the parts of Bluesky\n\nthat I've been really curious to see how it develops,\n\nis, you know, for a long time Twitter\n\nhad verification badges\n\nand that helped journalists, and government officials,\n\nand celebrities, and people who might be impersonated,\n\nor might otherwise just really wanna prove\n\nthat they are who they say they are.\n\nYou know, the verification badges were sort of the way\n\nthat most of the major social networks\n\nwent about offering that service.\n\nRight now on Bluesky, the verification process\n\nI honestly find con kind of convoluted.\n\nEven though I'm a WIRED writer and I should be tech savvy,\n\nI really struggle to understand how to verify myself\n\nbecause you have to put your own domain name,\n\nyou have to register.\n\nI'm not even gonna do a good job explaining it,\n\nbut it's kind of complicated.\n\nAnd as you're scaling up, I'm wondering, you know,\n\nare you starting to think of other ways\n\nto verify accounts that are perhaps simpler?\n\nWhat is your plan there?\n\nYeah, this has actually been a topic of discussion\n\non the network this week,\n\nbut I can back up and explain the verification\n\nthat we do have right now,\n\nwhich is intended to put user control front and center.\n\nAnd so that is the custom domain name system.\n\nSo if you are the New York Times, you know,\n\nyou can have that just be your domain, right?\n\nWIRED I think is also, you know, their own domain.\n\nAnd so that means that you're able to\n\nshow whoever owns this website\n\nis the person behind the account.\n\nAnd so that means, you know, even senators\n\ncan get a senate.gov domain\n\nand only a person who controls the senate.gov domain name\n\ncan give that to people.\n\nSo this is a way for organizations or well-known websites\n\nto self-verify without needing someone in the middle,\n\nlike us, to do that.\n\nBut that is a little bit complicated.\n\nWe have the ability for you\n\nto actually buy your own domain name through us,\n\nbut that's not necessarily what everyone wants,\n\nparticularly people already have their own domains.\n\nIs is buying your own domain name a profit center for you?\n\nIt's something that we actually just put out\n\nto try to make it easier for people\n\nbecause that way you don't have to set it up yourself.\n\nAnd also people like shorter usernames.\n\nAnd so, you know, everyone has a bsky.social\n\nif you don't have your own custom domain.\n\nAnd so if you just want like, I don't know, jay.com,\n\nI could buy that and then have that as my username.\n\nAnd so it creates a shorter link,\n\nshorter handle you can have.\n\nBut the way that we're talking\n\nabout exploring new ways of verification,\n\nand this is being done sort of in the open on GitHub,\n\non the network people are chatting about it,\n\nis putting out some form of verification\n\nwhere we will be one verifier\n\nand then others can verify as well.\n\nAnd so, because again, going back\n\nto this being an open network,\n\nthat means that, you know,\n\nwe could verify some organizations,\n\nsome people have some process for that,\n\nmaybe display a badge or something, you know.\n\nWe haven't come to a final conclusion on this yet,\n\nbut then other folks could do that as well.\n\nAnd so you could have other organizations,\n\nother people out there\n\ndoing their own verification processes.\n\nAnd then as a user you can decide which you want to trust.\n\nAnd so,\n\nif you wanna trust Bluesky's check mark system, you can,\n\nthat'll probably be a default,\n\nbut if you wanna install a different one\n\nor, you know, use a different version of it,\n\nyou can go and search for that.\n\nAnd so that means that the trust is ultimately rooted\n\nin what you as the user want to see\n\nas the verification system you believe in.\n\nSo Bluesky itself wouldn't be verifying\n\nthe other verification systems.\n\nThe app is always able\n\nto do some amount of customization over like, you know,\n\nwhat things we recommend.\n\nSo, for example, we have tons of feeds,\n\nwe have tons of moderation services,\n\nand we might recommend some\n\nbecause these have been around for a while.\n\nThese are more trusted.\n\nBut over time I think people, including us,\n\nstart to build up trust in the systems that work best.\n\nAnd so, you know, one that just popped up last night\n\nprobably won't be at the top of the search results\n\nand people won't be using it a lot.\n\nBut if there's, you know, a credible organization behind it\n\nwhere a lot of people are using it,\n\nthen that'll rise to the top.\n\nGotcha. Okay, very interesting.\n\nWIRED might have to start up its own verification service.\n\nSo Jay and I actually talked\n\nfor the first time last February,\n\nand one of the most memorable things she said to me\n\nwas that she was determined that Bluesky\n\nwould not become inshitified with advertisements.\n\nYes. [audience members clapping]\n\nA lot has happened since then though.\n\nYou know, I don't think,\n\nI've always been a fan of this service,\n\nbut I didn't expect it to take off in the way that it did\n\nin the past few months.\n\nYou've scaled in a way that is really unique\n\nand at the same time you've also, you know,\n\ntaken some venture capital investments.\n\nI just can, I can imagine\n\nthat there's more pressure than ever\n\nto figure out ways to be profitable.\n\nI'm wondering, you know,\n\nhow are you gonna be profitable\n\nwithout inshitifying the platform?\n\nYeah, I mean our goal from the start has been to make sure\n\nthat our incentives end up aligned with users\n\nand the people who've built this ecosystem.\n\nAnd so the ways that we're moving into monetization is,\n\nas we announced recently, starting with subscriptions.\n\nBut we're gonna go into, you know,\n\nexploring some other avenues here.\n\nOne of the things we really believe\n\nis that money follows value.\n\nSo we've started to, you know,\n\na lot of the effort we've put in is just showing\n\nthat there's value in having an open network\n\nand being able to build on it\n\nand other people can participate in that.\n\nSo people building feeds, building moderation services,\n\nbuilding the things that are, you know,\n\nmaking this a valuable ecosystem.\n\nAnd so our goal in moving into that\n\nis to build some network services,\n\nthings that, you know, developers can tap into,\n\nyou know, users can tap into.\n\nAnd, you know, not necessarily going to go into great detail\n\non all this right now,\n\nbut like subscriptions are the first step.\n\nAnd then from there we're gonna explore things that like,\n\nkeep our incentives aligned with the ecosystem.\n\nAre you going to roll out subscriptions soon?\n\nThat was the plan, but we've had a lot of growth recently\n\nand so right now it's a bit in flux.\n\nYeah, what has been, you know, the hardest part\n\nof growing at this rate?\n\nWell, we have a pretty small team.\n\nWe have 24 million users and a core team of 20 employees.\n\nAnd so we're focusing on scaling,\n\nwe're focusing on making sure\n\nthat it remains a good experience as we scale\n\nand really delivering the features that, you know,\n\nbecome urgent as, you know, new types of users come on\n\nand new types of problems arise.\n\nLike you mentioned, verification was something that,\n\nyou know, we've, from the start,\n\ntalked about open ways to do verification\n\nthat allows other people to participate in the process,\n\nbut that's sort of need for it now\n\nhas accelerated those discussions.\n\nGotcha.\n\nOne thing that a lot of people have brought up to me\n\nwhen I've told them that I'm gonna interview you\n\nis, you know, since Bluesky has exploded in popularity,\n\nthere are certain groups of people\n\nwho are really, really taking to the network.\n\nJournalists are one of the groups, you know.\n\nJournalists, I think, we're all so overjoyed\n\nto have a place to post links to our stories\n\nthat doesn't throttle them,\n\nthat we're like just beyond thrilled.\n\nThere has been this major exodus from X\n\nin the wake of the election,\n\nbut also even prior to the election,\n\na lot of people had issues\n\nwith the way that Elon Musk was running it.\n\nSo there's a large influx of people\n\nwho basically share a worldview, share ideologies.\n\nYou know, I'd say most people would agree\n\nthat right now the majority of people using Bluesky\n\nare liberal.\n\nAnd I've had a lot of conversations with people\n\nwho really like the app but are worried\n\nthat it's just never going to reach a network effect\n\nof bringing in people that aren't liberals,\n\nbringing in, you know, people from the right,\n\nyou know, people are worried\n\nthat it's just gonna be an echo chamber basically.\n\nAnd I'm curious if you are worried about that.\n\nLike I could see a world in which you'd just decide\n\nthat that's the lane that you're in\n\nand you're gonna stick with it,\n\nbut then that obviously limits growth.\n\nBasically I'm asking like, do you want all the people\n\nthat are still on X to come join Bluesky?\n\nDo you want people who are far right to be on Bluesky?\n\nLike what, what is your hope for what the user base\n\nis gonna look like going forward?\n\nWell, at the end of the day,\n\nwe set out to change the way social media works\n\nfrom the bottom up.\n\nThat's why we built on an open protocol,\n\nthat's, you know, how we got started.\n\nAnd so our goal is to build this for everyone.\n\nBluesky's for everyone.\n\nWe have the ability for people\n\nto create the spaces that they want.\n\nAnd even now,\n\nthere's actually lots of Blueskies within Bluesky\n\nbecause you're able to create so much customization.\n\nAnd so the way this works is we just try to give the users\n\nas many controls as possible.\n\nSo whoever, you know, posts a thread has controls over,\n\nyou know, what happens in that thread to some degree, right?\n\nBecause we're thinking about this as your Bluesky account\n\nbeing like your own blog.\n\nIt's actually similar,\n\nbecause you actually can host your own data,\n\nyour own account, on your own service if you want.\n\nAnd so just like a person who puts up a blog post\n\ncan go in and, you know, have some control\n\nover their comment section,\n\nthe person who posts a thread\n\non Bluesky, on your micro blog,\n\ngets to have that kind of control.\n\nAnd then if somebody is, you know, quote posting you\n\nand you wanna get outta this conversation,\n\nyou're not feeling it, you can remove yourself\n\nfrom those quote-posts.\n\nAnd so that means that, you know, some people say,\n\nwell this starts to create an echo chamber\n\nbecause you're not, you know, listening.\n\nBut actually there's just a lot of ways\n\nthat social media has gotten a bit tiring\n\nfor a lot of people\n\nbecause you can't necessarily get out of the conversations\n\nyou don't wanna be in\n\nunless you completely stop using the app.\n\nAnd so our goal is to get things to a point, you know,\n\nwith the way that we're building this app\n\nthat people have controls over\n\nhow they wanna spend their time online.\n\nAnd so you can go in and design a experience\n\nthat is just quiet posters and mutuals,\n\nif you really want that.\n\nAnd that's just-\n\nWhat's a quiet poster?\n\nYeah, so those are actually feeds that people have built\n\nthat mean that it just shows you posts\n\nfrom people you follow that don't post that often.\n\nSo maybe you have that friend\n\nthat uses social media like once a month\n\nand normally they'll get drowned out\n\nin the people who are posting every hour\n\nand you would never see their posts.\n\nBut if you go into that feed, then you're seeing the people\n\nwho, you know, who have just posted over the past few weeks\n\nor the past month and you catch up on that.\n\nAnd then the mutuals are people who\n\nI follow you and you follow me,\n\nand then I like to hear from the people who I already know\n\nand like, that's the conversation I wanna be in.\n\nAnd then if you wanna go dip in\n\nand see what's going on in the broader world,\n\nyou can go to say the Discover feed\n\nor the Politics and News feed,\n\nand check in on everything going by,\n\nmaybe participate in those conversations\n\nand then, you know, swipe away from that\n\nor uninstall them when you're done\n\nwith that kind of a conversation.\n\nAnd so that means that the people who come on here\n\nstart to be able to design the spaces that they want.\n\nDo you think then in that way\n\nthat people will be able to design experiences\n\nthat they want,\n\nbut that means they'll be able to exclude, you know,\n\nseeing posts that they don't wanna see?\n\nDo you think that that's gonna basically put a limit\n\non how much Bluesky can ever sort of simulate a town square?\n\nThere's the spaces where those kinds\n\nof broad town square discussions are happening as well,\n\nbut following our philosophy of just giving users control,\n\nI think it's up to the user what they want to see.\n\nBecause I think when people don't wanna participate\n\nin that kind of discussion,\n\nthey just don't use that app anymore.\n\nOr they withdraw to, you know, a text message group\n\nor a discord group or someplace where they feel\n\nlike they can be having the conversations\n\nwith the people that they want,\n\nand then they come back when they want to,\n\nyou know, talk to strangers\n\nabout all the stuff happening in the moment.\n\nWe want to make it possible\n\nto talk about everything happening in the moment,\n\nall the broader conversations going on,\n\nand have that be going by.\n\nAnd then you can dip in and out of that stream as you wish.\n\nAnd the ability to link to stuff,\n\nas you mentioned really easily,\n\nand follow through on those links, is another part of this,\n\nwhich is just seeing Bluesky as being a gateway\n\nto the open web.\n\nWe wanna make social more like the web again.\n\nAnd so that means that, you know,\n\nyou can click through, like we love links.\n\nWe want you to be able to, you know,\n\ngo through to where people are having conversations,\n\nnot even just on the app,\n\nbut if you're going to go, you know,\n\nread that news article and then comment on it,\n\nYour personal Bluesky experience when you're designing it,\n\nwhat are you prioritizing?\n\nAre you going, you know,\n\nare you treating it more like discord situation?\n\nAre you going for these mutuals and quiet posters?\n\nLike what, what are, what's your ideal, you know,\n\nscroll through Bluesky look like?\n\nI actually do both\n\nbecause I wanna catch up on what's going on\n\nand there's actually a Catchup feed\n\nthat shows you the most popular posts in the last 24 hours.\n\nAnd so I like to go through\n\nand see what everyone else has been talking about,\n\nlike get the vibe of the network that day\n\nand then see what the Discover feed shows me.\n\nBut then sometimes I actually do\n\ngo into the quiet posters or mutuals feed.\n\nThere's also one I really like called the Moss feed,\n\nwhich is just like forest pictures\n\npeople have taken on their hikes\n\nand because it's picking the stuff up in an automated way\n\nfrom everything people post,\n\nthese are people who, you know, maybe a new user came on\n\nand just posted a picture of a hike\n\nwith a mossy rock or something.\n\nAnd it's just like stepping out of the stream\n\nof all the broader conversations for a moment\n\nand just visiting a quiet corner of the network.\n\nAnd then, you know, I don't spend all day on there,\n\nbut then I go back to what else is going on,\n\nmaybe make a post.\n\nAnd so that's within my experience of the app,\n\nI can have these different corners of it for myself.\n\nI'm definitely gonna check out the Moss feed.\n\nI love a bog.\n\nIt's one of my favorites.\n\nYeah.\n\nFive years from now, where do you want Bluesky to be?\n\nI want to change the way social works.\n\nI want us to have choice over what we see,\n\nto have an open marketplace of different algorithms,\n\ndifferent timelines.\n\nI want us to have lots of people participating\n\nin building moderation services.\n\nSo these questions about how social media is moderated,\n\nwho controls what you see, gets placed back in users' hands,\n\nin developers' hands,\n\nand in the hands of anyone who's interested\n\nin helping improve the situation, right?\n\nLike civil society organizations,\n\nacademic researchers who have ideas\n\nfor how social could be different.\n\nI had a talk recently with some folks\n\nwho are exploring pro-social algorithms.\n\nSo how do we get people\n\nto have better conversations with each other,\n\nmaybe from different perspectives\n\nor different parts of political spectrum\n\nthrough the ways that we build the algorithms actually.\n\nSo instead of highlighting the most outrage\n\nor the most engagement generating things,\n\nwhich aren't necessarily\n\ncausing people to change their minds,\n\nbut maybe actually driving them further apart.\n\nWhat if we build things that find the commonalities\n\nand bring people together?\n\nAnd those kinds of experiments\n\ncan be done on Bluesky right now\n\nbecause those researchers can build a feed,\n\nspin it up, get users to try it,\n\nand they don't have to go lobby a company for change\n\nor lobby regulators for change.\n\nThey can just experiment with what if we just change\n\nthis app that's giving us the ability to get our hands in\n\nand start, you know, making changes right now.\n\nI would love to test one of those algorithms out someday.\n\nOkay, we don't have that much time left,\n\nbut I do need to ask you about something.\n\nSo I was talking\n\nto our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, earlier,\n\nand she's a big Bluesky fan too.\n\nAnd I was talking about something that I had skeeted\n\nand she like visibly recoiled\n\nand she doesn't like the phrase,\n\nand if you guys aren't aren't familiar,\n\nBluesky's user base basically took it upon itself\n\nto call what you put out into the feed a skeet\n\nIt's kind of a play on a tweet\n\nand it doesn't have any other meaning.\n\nSo, you know, and now that you're blowing up,\n\nlike are we sticking with skeet?\n\nI have always called them posts.\n\n[audience and Jay laughing]\n\nI maintain that they are called posts\n\nbecause when we set out to do this,\n\nwe were not trying to invent new words,\n\nand we were building a protocol.\n\nSo there's gonna be other apps, there are other apps,\n\nthere's other things people use\n\nand not all of them are going to call posts the same thing.\n\nOn the other hand, this is very user-driven\n\nand, you know, the ecosystem evolves as it will.\n\nSo I'm gonna keep calling them posts.\n\nThe Bluesky app, when you go to post something\n\nsays post and quote post,\n\nbut there's other apps out there\n\nthat have called them skeets.\n\nDo you have a favorite post?\n\nLike one of those that\n\nuse rent free- My, yeah,\n\nLike is there any, is there any,\n\nI was gonna say do you have a favorite skeet,\n\nbut I'll call 'em posts.\n\nLike, is there a platonic ideal of a Bluesky post\n\nthat you look at and you think like,\n\nYeah, I did a good job.\n\nLike what's your favorite skeet?\n\nLet's see.\n\nWell the one that sprang to mind\n\nis somebody made a joke about vitamin water\n\nthat I still remember,\n\nand they said, you know, Oh, it's vitamin water.\n\nWhat vitamins does it have in it?\n\nPink.\n\nAnd that's how I feel about vitamin water,\n\nbut I still love it.\n\nSo I don't know why I thought of that,\n\nbut that's one of the ones I like.\n\nThere's just a lot of posts like that\n\nthat go by and make me laugh.\n\nNo, I'm honestly very, very impressed\n\nthat you came up with one on the spot\n\n'cause I didn't tell her I was gonna ask her that.\n\nThat is all the time that we have.\n\nBut, Jay, thank you so much for joining us and-\n\n[Jay] Thank you.\n\nEveryone should get a Bluesky account.\n\n[audience applauding]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, thank you all for being here today,\n\nto echo what Katie said.\n\nI'm so excited to be talking with Meredith Whittaker.\n\nMeredith is the President of the Signal Foundation,\n\nwhich for those who don't know overseas and runs\n\nand maintains the Signal Messenger,\n\nwhich is an encrypted messaging app and platform\n\nthat is used by hundreds of millions of people globally.\n\nAs far as WIRED's concerned,\n\nthe gold standard in encrypted messaging,\n\nwe all use it, recommend that you do too.\n\nBut Meredith also co-founded the AI Now Institute at NYU,\n\nwhich focuses on the social implications of AI and tech\n\nand spent over a decade at Google,\n\nwhich I think is also especially relevant\n\ngiven what we're talking about today, which is the idea of,\n\nit says surveillance capitalism.\n\nOh, it did.\n\nThe name of the talk Does it.\n\n[Brian] Where? is about\n\nsurveillance capitalism, if you check your program,\n\nif there's a program.\n\nBut I think we wanna draw a little bit of distinction there\n\nabout what we're really talking about today, Meredith,\n\nwhich is more of a surveillance business model\n\nthat has kind of defined the last couple of decades of tech.\n\nYeah, well, it's great to be here with you, Brian,\n\nand thank you everyone.\n\nI think, you know,\n\nas someone with a bit of an academic background\n\nwho really pays attention to definitions,\n\nthis is just a clarification I often make,\n\nsurveillance capitalism is an more or less academic term\n\nthat is very freighted with sort of disciplinary histories.\n\nAnd when we at Signal,\n\nwhen I talk about the surveillance business model,\n\nwe're being a bit more diagnostic and a bit more, I think,\n\nschematic about what we're talking about.\n\nUltimately, Signal exists in an industry\n\nwhere the profit incentive is defined by surveillance,\n\nand that's not a scary term.\n\nIn this case, we're talking about data collection.\n\nYou collect as much data as you can\n\nabout whatever your domain is, your customers,\n\nyour environment, what have you.\n\nYou use that to create models, to target ads, perhaps,\n\nor to train AI models or what have you.\n\nOr if you don't do that, you provide goods and services,\n\ntool chains and libraries to those who do.\n\nSo there's a flywheel,\n\nthere's sort of a center of this industry\n\nthat is defined economically\n\nby the collection and creation of data\n\nwith this sort of the more, the better paradigm.\n\nAnd in Signal's case, we reject that out of hand,\n\nof course, because we are motivated and dedicated\n\nto preserving privacy, to creating technology\n\nthat maintains the hundreds of thousands of years of,\n\nyou know, private communications as a norm\n\ninto an age where privacy is vanishingly scarce\n\nin our daily lives and communities and activities.\n\nSo when we talk about the surveillance business model,\n\nwe are talking about a paradigm\n\nwithin which Signal both exists and which it rejects.\n\nAnd I think what we see here\n\nis Signal almost as the acid test for what's wrong\n\nwith the current incentive structure in tech,\n\nwhen something as valuable as Signal\n\ncan't figure out how to make a profit.\n\nWhen we can be core infrastructure for human rights work,\n\nfor journalism, for every military in the world,\n\nif we're gonna be frank, for governments, for boardrooms,\n\nwhen it's clear we are the gold standard\n\nfor a value that everyone cares about.\n\nThe Apple Billboards proclaiming privacy,\n\nMeta's sort of turned to privacy.\n\nThis is something,\n\nit is clear there is a market for and people want,\n\nand yet we have to squeeze ourselves into a nonprofit shape\n\nthat is not quite conducive\n\nfor the high availability realtime tech\n\nwe are maintaining and developing,\n\nsimply because there's no real way to make a profit\n\nin the tech industry given the surveillance incentives.\n\nSo I think that introduces\n\nwhy we focus on that paradigm so much\n\nand kind of the distinction practically speaking\n\nbetween how we use it\n\nand how it might be used in different academic discourses.\n\nWell, and I think that is the central question, right?\n\nIs you are presenting a model\n\nof how to do things differently\n\nand beyond just messaging,\n\nbut you are providing the messaging, a messaging model\n\nand then maybe other people can follow that.\n\nBut I think what's interesting\n\nand why I'm glad to talk to you\n\nis that it's not just hypothetical,\n\nyou are currently making it work\n\nand you genuinely have this sense that things are changing.\n\nYou wrote for WIRED in an essay\n\nthat we published a couple weeks ago,\n\nNext year will be big tech's finale.\n\nDo you feel like we are at a sea change?\n\nDo you feel like we are that close\n\nto things unwinding for big tech or, you know,\n\nis that a little more hyperbolic\n\nand it takes a little more step,\n\na few more steps to get there?\n\nYeah, well, look, y'all asked me in the middle of 2024\n\nto write a prediction for 2025, like, you know,\n\npast data does not necessarily predict a volatile future.\n\nAnd what I really wanted to write was,\n\nyou know, like I sat down and I thought,\n\nwell, what is there to be optimistic about right now, right?\n\nLike, how do I actually\n\nsort of sincerely communicate optimism?\n\nAnd what I came to is, well, you know,\n\nlet's write something that is half manifestation\n\nand half optimism as invitation, right?\n\nThat's not a prediction where we say,\n\noh, it looks like, you know, probability approaching one,\n\nwe can all sit back\n\nand let the gears of the world take shape.\n\nNo, this is an invitation to action\n\nand to marshal the forces that I do truly see fomenting\n\nin which I have never seen a broader\n\nand more heterogeneous coalition\n\nlooking at concentration of power in tech,\n\nlooking at the deep dangers of pooling vast dossiers\n\nof surveillance data on every person on earth\n\nin the hands of a few companies,\n\nlooking at these choke points and single points of failure\n\nwhere, you know, one bug and a kernel driver\n\ncan take down core infrastructure globally across medicine,\n\ntransportation, governments, you know, what have you.\n\nLike, none of those things are chill or nice.\n\nNo one is championing them,\n\ncertainly not in the way they were 10 years ago\n\nor even five years ago,\n\nso, you know, the first step to a strategy for change\n\nis an honest map, and that's what I think we have now.\n\nNo one is pretending this is okay.\n\nAnd so that is the opportunity\n\nand the invitation for change.\n\nAnd again, to take things like Signal,\n\nwhich is, you know, we're existing as a nonprofit.\n\nWe exist on donations.\n\nWe persevere at being kind of the keystone species\n\nin the tech ecosystem around privacy and tech\n\nthat is rights preserving and works with integrity,\n\nbut we're not looking to be alone, right?\n\nWe don't wanna be the outlier that proves the rule.\n\nWe want to be a new set of rules\n\nleading the way to a much more open\n\nand diverse tech ecosystem that,\n\nagain, isn't reliant on like,\n\nyou know, 5 companies and 15 guys\n\nin a paradigm that is very, very stale,\n\nand ultimately not healthy for the world or the future.\n\nWell, and I wanna talk about Signal and how it is,\n\nyou know, it is ubiquitous,\n\nespecially among the privacy conscious.\n\nBut that ubiquity is expensive, right?\n\nSignal cost about $36 million to run last year\n\nand about 50 million to run now, which is a pretty big jump.\n\nAbout two thirds of that,\n\nby my understanding at least in 2023,\n\ncame from contributions.\n\n[Meredith] Is that? It all came\n\nfrom contributions.\n\n[Meredith] All, okay. It's fully\n\ndonor supported. So as you grow,\n\nthings get more expensive, you need more donor support\n\nto fund all of this, these features, these servers,\n\nhow sustainable is that?\n\nDo you feel like you're on a flywheel right now\n\nwhere as you grow the donations grow in kind\n\nor does there need to be another model that steps in\n\nthat makes you sustainable for the long term?\n\nWell, I mean, it's kind of a,\n\nit's a bit of a tricky question\n\nbecause it's sustainable right now\n\nbecause there are a lot of people who value privacy\n\nand who get why what we're doing is so critical, right?\n\nLike, one thing to take home, we couldn't make Signal again\n\nif the heartbeat stopped, right?\n\nIf Signal went away for a year, you can't just restart\n\na globally interconnected communications network\n\nwhere you can pick up your phone\n\nand knew your friend also has it installed on their app.\n\nThat network effect is huge, it is not replicable.\n\nAnd when Signal came up over 10 years ago\n\nwhen it emerged as two apps, then one app,\n\nand the sort of history of Signal\n\nand the masterful work of its founder, Moxie Marlinspike,\n\nwho basically carried this thing through for a decade,\n\nit was coming up in an environment\n\nwhere its competition was web clients.\n\nLike remember Jabber and Google Chat, right?\n\nIt was coming up in an environment\n\nwhere less than 30% of human beings had a smartphone.\n\nMost people left their desktop at their work\n\nwhen they went home.\n\nA vastly, dramatically different ecosystem\n\nthan what we have today where we have incumbent monopolies\n\nwho've saturated the market, right?\n\nAnd so we're talking about preserving something\n\nthat grew through the cracks into sort of a mighty tree,\n\nlet's use that metaphor,\n\nand needs to continue to be fed and watered\n\nbecause without that, you know,\n\nwe can't just snap our fingers and introduce tech\n\nthat will actually serve the purpose of Signal, right?\n\nBecause everyone has to use Signal for you to use it.\n\nYou can be the most, you know,\n\nthe most virtuosic cryptographer\n\nwho created the most elegant\n\nand beautiful private communications technology.\n\nYou go out there, you're like, hey, use it, right?\n\nBut if your friend doesn't use it,\n\nit doesn't matter to you, right?\n\nSo that network effect is hugely important\n\nand the reputation that Signal has developed\n\nbecause of the care and attention\n\nand sometimes agitation of the hacker and InfoSec community\n\nis equally important, 'cause we develop all in the open,\n\nour cryptographic implementations and our core technologies\n\nare open source, every change to our repo get scrutinized\n\nby like communities of dudes\n\nwho are like trained spotters for signal code pushes, right?\n\nAnd that like, we love them for it\n\nbecause they will find a little bug and they will report it,\n\nso it's really making good on the promise\n\nthat many eyes make more secure code.\n\nAnd again, that's, you know, similar to CUDA\n\nor some of the other standards and infrastructures\n\nyou might hear about in other sectors like AI,\n\nwhat we're talking about is a community of practice,\n\na community of labor norms, and a sort of,\n\nyou know, standardized understanding of tech\n\nthat has come through this, you know,\n\nSignal as infrastructure over about 10 years,\n\nand again, can't just be recreated, right?\n\nI can publish anything on GitHub,\n\nbut I can't force anyone to read it or care about it, right?\n\nSo these things are very, very precious\n\nand they need to be maintained.\n\nThey need to be supported,\n\nand right now we do have support.\n\nWe're looking to diversify that,\n\nyou know, now is a very critical moment for privacy,\n\npreserving communications.\n\nYou know, the more geopolitically volatile the world is,\n\nthe more it's important for us to be able to have real talk\n\nthat is not interrupted by surveillance.\n\nAnd so I think, you know,\n\nwe're working on growing the base of supporters\n\nand thinking through are there models\n\nthat can marshal the type of money we need, right?\n\nIt's absurd that we are a core infrastructure,\n\nyou know, from everything to human rights and defense,\n\nand then you see these companies\n\nthat are basically white labeling some like AI API\n\ngetting billion dollar valuations,\n\nand we can't figure out how to like make money on that\n\nto sustain a thing that if it went away\n\nwould literally change the fates of nations,\n\nlike y'all, right?\n\nWell, and can I, you wrote also,\n\nI know you wrote it a little bit ago, but about this idea\n\nof this nonprofit critical infrastructure ecosystem, right?\n\nSo not just Signal, but other aspects\n\nwhere we are too reliant on private companies.\n\nWhere's the, where's the nonprofit version of that?\n\nAnd as part of that,\n\nyou mentioned a need for state capital to get involved\n\nat some point.\n\nIs that when you talk about\n\nalternative and diversifying funding,\n\nis that something that Signal's looking at?\n\nAnd are there any concerns with that too\n\nabout taking money from governments\n\nthat you're also protecting people from with,\n\nyou know? Yeah,\n\nnone of this is simple friend.\n\nYeah, oh yeah, no for sure.\n\nLike what I'm looking at\n\nis there's the type of capital we need,\n\nhow do we get it?\n\nNot how do we partner with states, absolutely not,\n\nnot how do we sort of enter into shady agreements.\n\nI think there is, you know,\n\nthe issue here is not nonprofit or for-profit.\n\nNonprofit is a tax status,\n\nit's not actually like comfortable or amenable.\n\nLike we are constantly, you know,\n\nI feel like we're like fitting inside a dollhouse.\n\nWe're like a massive, you know, like tech,\n\nnot massive in size, but like, we have to maintain,\n\nwe have to act and function like a tech company.\n\nWe are for all intensive purposes a tech company.\n\nWe are a nonprofit tech tax structure,\n\nbecause again, that means that my board\n\nisn't gonna go to Davos\n\nor isn't gonna be pushed to have sort of,\n\nyou know, a profit motive come back to me\n\nand be like, I love you Meredith.\n\nI love this privacy thing real cool, real nice,\n\nbut ultimately I have a fiduciary duty\n\nand just as the board sold Twitter,\n\nour board is gonna have to strip some privacy protections\n\nbecause you have to be making some revenue, right?\n\nThat's the risk that we are warding against\n\nwith the nonprofit structure.\n\nWe are not celebrating nonprofit\n\nas some sort of alternative to private enterprise,\n\nand those are the two,\n\nyou know, the cage match there, right?\n\nThis is a structure that we have to have\n\nif we're gonna preserve our obsessive mission on privacy,\n\nbecause otherwise it would be whittled away\n\nbecause those dudes on my board\n\nultimately have no choice or they want an AI strategy\n\nor they're, you know, whatever, whatever.\n\nThere's a lot of ways we could make money\n\nthat we simply are not gonna make money doing\n\nbecause we're privacy preserving.\n\nSo the call here is not everyone come be a nonprofit.\n\nNonprofit is not the perfect form.\n\nIt is a prophylactic from the incentives,\n\nthe perverse incentives that define the industry we're in.\n\nAnd that, you know, how do we create better incentives?\n\nHow do we marshal things like state capital, which is,\n\nyou know, let's be clear\n\nthat's going to tech all day every day.\n\nIf you look at the subsidies,\n\nif you look at the research history,\n\nif you look at the massive cloud contracts\n\nthat are now ultimately the pipeline of revenue\n\nfor most of these companies, or a big pipeline of revenue,\n\nlike there's no state capital involved here.\n\nI mean, you look at their government sales departments\n\nin any one of these large companies,\n\nthey, you know, [indistinct] has a magnitude\n\nbigger than Signal's team, right?\n\nSo we also have to stop with these bright lines\n\nas if there's some, you know,\n\nclear I guess difference between sort of private industry\n\nwith state control, what have you, yeah.\n\nSo I think the question then is how do we marshal that,\n\nyou know,\n\nhow do we marshal state capital without state control?\n\nHow do you get long-term commitments, guarantees?\n\nHow do you do things like the sovereign tech agency\n\nin Germany, which was set up ultimately\n\nto take government appropriations,\n\nbut then has a lot of clear, a lot of clear boundaries\n\nwhere they independently allocate those\n\noutside of state control.\n\nSo we're, you know, we're interested there,\n\nbut I had to, I had to kind of go into a long digression,\n\nI think to explain what we're actually talking about,\n\n[Brian] which is not, It was a good one.\n\nnot a clean schematic, not a clean divide\n\nbetween for-profit\n\nand non-profit. Clean is boring.\n\nI think that was a really\n\n[Meredith] illuminating. Yeah,\n\nclean is boring. Yeah, right?\n\nWhile we're on the topic of governments,\n\nwe obviously had an election here in the US recently.\n\nDonald Trump, yeah. What, when?\n\nIt's true, it's true.\n\nRead about it on wired.com.\n\nIs that a website? It is, it is.\n\nSo, but I wanna talk to you about it.\n\nI think a, there's, well, the Trump administration,\n\nthe last go round was hostile to encryption,\n\nnot, you know, several governments worldwide are.\n\nYou've got Kash Patel coming in potentially as FBI director.\n\nHow does this affect Signal, its users?\n\nLike what is Signal's role in this moment?\n\nHow are you feeling about the incoming administration,\n\nboth for your users and for Signal itself?\n\nI mean, look, Signal knows who we are.\n\nSignal will continue being Signal.\n\nSignal has one thing we do and we do it really well\n\nand we do it pretty obsessively, and that is provide\n\ntruly private communications infrastructure\n\nto everyone everywhere globally, full stop.\n\nWe're not changing.\n\nThat's how I feel.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nIs Signal going to stay in the United States\n\nno matter what in terms of where it's based?\n\nI mean, we're a global, we're a global operation\n\nin so far as we, you know,\n\npeople use Signal everywhere around the world,\n\nacross the globe.\n\nWe're an open source project.\n\nWe have people who, you know,\n\nwe don't routinely take third party commits,\n\nand when we do, we scrutinize them really closely, right?\n\nBut we do have people who sort of,\n\nyou know, contribute to Signal globally.\n\nWe're a jurisdiction in the US and we don't, you know,\n\nwe don't have plans to share on that, but we are, you know,\n\nwe are not a globally interconnected communication network\n\nhas to touch as many people as possible,\n\nso you can make that call from like Bangkok\n\nto Kingston, Jamaica,\n\nand then make it from Kingston to London\n\nand then London to New York.\n\nSo, you know, we don't have any plans to move.\n\nWe are focused on markets around the globe\n\nand we are of course aware of the way that,\n\nyou know, geopolitical volatility\n\ninforms our ability to function in one or another market.\n\nWe've been fighting things like the online safety bill,\n\nNow Act in the UK, which threatened to,\n\nand still sort of threatens, but much more in the distance\n\nto mandate back doors in end-to-end encrypted communication,\n\nyou know, a disastrous cybersecurity vulnerability\n\nthat would ultimately undermine Signal anywhere it's used\n\nirrespective of jurisdiction.\n\nWe're fighting Chat Controls,\n\nwhich is the European version of that law.\n\nIt's sort of like this, it's this zombie that honestly,\n\nyou know, since 1976 when Diffie and Hellman\n\ntried to publish their paper\n\nintroducing public-key cryptography\n\nand the US government freaked out\n\nand tried to suppress publication of that paper\n\nhas been this sort of, you know,\n\never present specter behind the idea\n\nthat there could be private communication networks\n\nor other privacy preserving technology\n\nthat would protect interpersonal communications\n\nand activities,\n\nnot simply government or corporate activities.\n\nAnd this is a tension that threads\n\nthrough the crypto wars in the nineties\n\nwith the specter of evil\n\nthat encryption is said to be protecting,\n\nchanging over time, you know, it's terrorists,\n\nit's people who harm children, it's what have you.\n\nBut with the goal remaining steadfastly focused\n\nultimately on destroying the only technology we have\n\nto preserve the human right of privacy\n\nin an age of unprecedented mass surveillance.\n\nSo we fight that wherever it emerges.\n\nWith the time we have left,\n\nI want to talk a little bit about the future for Signal\n\non a product level,\n\nwhich it sort of feels less grand than,\n\nyou know, global fights against [indistinct],\n\nbut is fundamentally what it is, it is Signal itself.\n\nWhat I wanna ask is, as you grow out features you have,\n\nit feels more complicated\n\nbecause you have to build them out in a secure way\n\nwhereas your competitors do not,\n\nso it's more expensive, more timely,\n\nharder to keep parity in certain ways.\n\nWhat do you see as future, as Signal's future as a product?\n\nWhat's next on the roadmap?\n\nWhat do you care about, parity about?\n\nWhat do you not care about?\n\nWhich is really a way to ask about AI,\n\n'cause no one has yet, I get to be the first person today.\n\nEveryone's gonna do it, so I just, I get to do it here.\n\nWhat does Signal need to do to keep up with and expand\n\nand get to a billion users that it's not doing right now?\n\nWell, we have to provide a product\n\nthat when anyone picks it up, looks and feels normal,\n\nthat works, that when you wanna send\n\na cat dancing on a birthday cake to your auntie thread,\n\nyou can go to gift search\n\nand type in cat birthday cake dance\n\nand the right little thing will pop up\n\nand you send it to your aunties, right?\n\nIt has to do that.\n\nThat is fundamental,\n\nas fundamental as ensuring that our crypto systems\n\nare robust and not susceptible to attack.\n\nBecause again, if your friends don't use Signal,\n\nit doesn't matter how ideologically committed\n\nto privacy you are, you don't use Signal either,\n\nunless you know, I don't know,\n\nyou open it to send note to self,\n\nbut note to self is a great feature by the way.\n\nSo, you know, what we are aiming for\n\nis a product that just works,\n\n'cause no one picks up their phone to use Signal.\n\nThey pick up their phone to talk to their partner\n\nor talk to their dad or, you know,\n\nthe actual imperative of messaging\n\nis human relationships and connection,\n\nand so honoring those as a first order\n\nis what Signal has to do\n\non the same level as ensuring privacy preservation.\n\nAnd this is where I think,\n\nyou know, the early Signal team, Moxie, Tyler,\n\nsome of the people who are really at the founding\n\nof this product got it right where very few people did.\n\n'Cause there was a whole crop of sort of privacy preserving,\n\ncommand line looking, PGP looking, you know,\n\ntechnology that no one used.\n\nI was a person trying as hard as I could\n\nto get anyone I know\n\nto like email me back with PGP and crickets, right?\n\nNot because people didn't care,\n\nbut because ultimately when they wanted to talk to me,\n\nthey didn't wanna do that.\n\nAnd so from its inception,\n\nSignal has really focused on usability, on design,\n\nand on being extremely stringent about making an app\n\nthat looked and felt normative.\n\nAnd so we will continue doing that and I think,\n\nyou know, that means that we're doing something, you know,\n\nyou should see in the next months or so, encrypted backups,\n\nwhich is a, you know, that's a gap, you know,\n\nso you can back things up\n\nand if your phone falls in a river,\n\neverything isn't on device and lost, right,\n\nwhich is a, you know, a thing that we wanna do.\n\nIt's obviously much harder to do in a privacy preserving way\n\nwhere we have full deniability around,\n\nyou know, our ability to, you know, see people's data,\n\nbackups are tricky there.\n\nso we're looking at improving some of those gaps.\n\nI don't, you know, AI,\n\nwhat I see across a lot of these apps right now is a,\n\nI would say almost a glassy-eyed company imperative\n\nthat is coming down from the top\n\nto integrate AI into everything.\n\nAnd I can imagine how the OKRs get written,\n\nyou know, it's the year of AI and then your little VP,\n\nright, is like, Okay guys, it's the year of AI.\n\nIntegrate this into your group level or your product level.\n\nOkay, well then there's somebody here who has to take on,\n\nyou know, integrating an AI feature into this,\n\nbut like, that's not how good innovation happens, right?\n\nAnd that's why we have these little prompters,\n\nthese little like, Hey, let me write your mom for you.\n\nAnd I'm like, You don't need to write my mom.\n\nLike stop it, right?\n\nAnd so I think what we're seeing is like this,\n\nlike it's annoying at this point.\n\nIt is cluttered, it is swirly and swoopy and unclear\n\nand it doesn't actually solve a problem for me.\n\nThe problem it solves is AI takes vast amounts of capital\n\nin the bigger is better form we have,\n\nand there is a need for a consumer market fit, right?\n\nAnd they're trying, right?\n\nThey have people who are like,\n\nwell, they said, it's the year of AI.\n\nLet's try to shoehorn this into an interface\n\nthat ultimately would serve us better if it were cleaner,\n\nwould serve us better\n\nif it weren't cluttering up with suggestions\n\nand like little prompts, right?\n\nAnd so that's the thing Signal's not gonna do.\n\nAnd Signal doesn't have to, again, 'cause we, you know,\n\nwe didn't go out and invest a trillion dollars\n\nin data centers on a bet that this stuff was gonna,\n\nyou know, return as a good product feature,\n\nwhich is another benefit of kind of our model.\n\nSo we're laser focused on doing one thing\n\nand doing it very, very, very, very, very well,\n\nand when you know, something comes along\n\nthat doesn't serve that we don't have to pick up that mantle\n\nbecause we're not chasing quarterly returns.\n\nWe're not chasing sort of investor approval,\n\nyou know, to make sure that we continue with the valuation\n\nthat we'll, you know, keep our C-suite employed, right?\n\nAnd so, you know, we do use a little bit of AI\n\nand it's an on-device face detection model.\n\nIf you go to Face Blur feature,\n\nit works kind of half the time, it's fine,\n\nbut you know, again, when we talk about AI right now,\n\nwe're talking about these bigger is better\n\nsort of transformer models, everything is generative,\n\nand ultimately I think a lot of that is gonna fade away\n\nbecause it's not proving useful in a consumer context.\n\nMeredith, thank you so much.\n\nThat's all we have time for.\n\nI really enjoyed talking with you.\n\nI really appreciate it.\n\nThank you.

                "text": "Transcript\n\nHi Brian.\n\n[Brian] You want me to sit?\n\nYeah, you can sit down.\n\nWhile we're doing this,\n\nI'm gonna tell you just a little bit about Brian and Airbnb.\n\nI won't be long, but I will just say Airbnb,\n\n4 million hosts,\n\n1.5 billion guests\n\nacross more than 220 countries.\n\nPretty incredible.\n\nTransformed the entire travel industry, no big deal.\n\nVery happy to have you here\n\nfor our last conversation of the day\n\nbefore we have some drinks.\n\nAnd let me start by backing up,\n\nwhich is something I maybe tend to do in interviews.\n\nI apologize, I'm a linear thinker,\n\nbut I've been thinking a lot lately,\n\nfor reasons that are probably obvious,\n\nabout time in four year increments.\n\nAnd if you think back four years, 2020,\n\nthe world in the midst of a devastating pandemic\n\nand an event that for your company was,\n\nI mean, I will,\n\nthe word that comes to mind for me is existential, right?\n\nCatastrophic.\n\nI think you laid off at the time\n\nsomething like 25% of your staff.\n\nAnd yet here we are today talking about,\n\nor we are going to be talking about,\n\nthe evolution of Airbnb, what's next?\n\nSo I'm curious, from your point of view,\n\nI will not make you relive that whole experience,\n\nbut from 2020 to now,\n\nwhen you think about everything that has changed\n\nfor your company,\n\nwhat stands out?\n\nWhat are sort of like the big milestones\n\nor the big moments in Airbnb's,\n\nlike recent history\n\nfrom that really sort of like existential moment\n\nfour years ago,\n\nSo it was January, 2020,\n\nwe were working on our IPO\n\nand it was gonna be one of the big IPOs since like Uber.\n\nAnd I remember I was in a meeting\n\nand it was late January and we saw our business in China,\n\nwe had a business in China,\n\nand it fell off a cliff.\n\nIt dropped like 80%.\n\nAnd I said, what, what is this?\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAnd they said,\n\nOh, there's this thing called the coronavirus.\n\nAnd I had never heard of it and probably none of you had\n\nbecause it hadn't made the front page of the newspaper yet.\n\nAnd I remember saying something kind of innocently like,\n\nwow, if if this thing spread beyond China,\n\nit would be really bad.\n\n[Interviewer] We would be real screwed. Yeah.\n\nAnd within eight weeks we lost 80% of our business.\n\n[Interviewer] That's so crazy.\n\nAnd to lose 80% of our business,\n\nand we were doing about $35 billion a year,\n\nso that was more than the sales of Starbucks,\n\nand when you're doing that much business\n\nand you lose almost all of it,\n\nit's like you're in a 18 wheeler,\n\nyou're going 80 miles an hour\n\nand then you slam on the brakes.\n\nThere is no easy nonviolent way that,\n\nlike everything just is smooth.\n\nAnd there were actually articles,\n\nlike Is this the end of Airbnb?\n\nWill Airbnb exist?\n\nAnd I think we were one of the,\n\nlike the tips of the spear of this kind of crisis.\n\nAnd you know,\n\nthere's nothing,\n\nlike I've thankfully I've never had\n\nlike a near death experience\n\nand I don't think we ever had\n\na near death business experience,\n\nbut we didn't know it at the time.\n\nAnd there's something about your business flashing\n\nbefore your eyes that makes,\n\ngives you a clarity that you don't have in any other time.\n\nAnd at that moment,\n\nlike I think that became the defining moment of the company.\n\nThe first thing we had to do is,\n\nwe had to like cut the company almost in half by size.\n\nWe did a layoff of about 25% employees,\n\nbut we also had a lot of contingent workers, contractors.\n\nSo we really lost about a third of the company.\n\nWe had to then go,\n\nI had to go through like a thousand different projects\n\nin the company line by line,\n\ncutting as many things as possible.\n\nAnd so it's like your house is on fire,\n\nyou go in a house and you can only take out\n\nlike a handful of things outta the house.\n\nThat is really, really clarifying.\n\nAnd I suddenly just changed how I operated,\n\nbecause I think I had been operating\n\nlike in a totally different way.\n\nSee I was told that like the way you should run a company\n\nis you should hire great people\n\nand you should just trust them\n\nand get outta their way to do their job.\n\nAnd that sounds nice on the surface.\n\nI don't think Jensen, who was just before me, does that.\n\nHe has 40 direct reports, I believe.\n\nAnd what I had done,\n\nwas I thought like,\n\nfounders are in the details\n\nand you are involved in all decisions\n\nand over time you step out.\n\nAnd that was the biggest mistake I ever did.\n\nAnd many of the founders\n\nand many of the leaders I've met,\n\nthe biggest mistake they make\n\nis they step outta the details.\n\nBecause what I've learned\n\nis that great leadership is presence, not absence.\n\nAnd that people can be empowered\n\nwith you being very involved,\n\n'cause you can actually put your entire weight behind them.\n\nAnd so I got really, really hands-on.\n\nWe made the company much smaller.\n\nWe felt like we wanted to be\n\nnot the Navy but the Navy Seals.\n\nWe went back to a functional organization,\n\nwe moved to like these release cycles\n\nwhere we started doing software updates,\n\nkind of like an operating system.\n\nWe almost started developing software like hardware\n\nbecause I felt like we were a free for all organization,\n\nwe were like divided into all these different divisions,\n\ngoing in a thousand different directions,\n\nand you open the app every year and you're like,\n\nwhy does the app look no different the year before?\n\nSo we really simplified, we got back to the basics,\n\ngot back to like,\n\nand the first thing we did is I said,\n\nalright, we're gonna expand beyond a core business,\n\nwhich I know you'll ask about,\n\nbut we have to have permission\n\nto expand beyond the core business.\n\nSo before we do new stuff,\n\nwe're gonna figure out all the things people don't like\n\nabout Airbnb and we're gonna start\n\nto address them one by one.\n\nSo people said prices are too high.\n\nSo we started working on,\n\nlike working on making Airbnb more affordable.\n\nPeople started saying like,\n\nwell the quality is not really good.\n\nSo we started working on a lot of quality issues.\n\nPeople said the app was too difficult to use,\n\nit'd become pretty much a Frankenstein of an app\n\nbecause you had all these different teams\n\npushing code every hour, every day.\n\nThere was no cohesive vision.\n\nSo we started focusing on that\n\nand over the last three years,\n\nwe do these releases twice a year,\n\none in May, one in November,\n\nthe entire company rose in one direction.\n\nWe have this two year roadmap.\n\nSo we look out two years,\n\nalmost no other software company does that,\n\nand we've made over 535 features in upgrades and fixes,\n\nthe service is by no means perfect,\n\nbut the results are today the company is stronger than ever\n\nand a company that people thought was going outta business\n\ndoes more money as a free cash flow,\n\nas a percent of revenue,\n\nthan almost any company in Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd I think this really just comes back to this,\n\nyou know, quote that Andy Grove, you know,\n\nhe was CEO of Intel, he said,\n\nA bad company's destroyed by a crisis.\n\nGood companies survive a crisis,\n\nbut great companies are defined by a crisis.\n\nAnd I always wanted the pandemic to be our defining moment,\n\nand I think it probably was.\n\n[Interviewer] Fantastic.\n\nSo you're now in this position\n\nwhere you've effectively sort of rebuilt\n\nand reoriented Airbnb and you're right,\n\nI am gonna ask you about moving beyond the core business.\n\nYou've launched some really interesting features\n\nrelatively recently, right?\n\nLike the icons program is one,\n\nwhere you can stay in all sorts of wild\n\nand crazy different places.\n\nYou recently launched a co-host program\n\nand I noticed I'm taking my daughter\n\non a trip in the spring,\n\nI can't tell you where because she doesn't know yet,\n\nbut when I booked the trip on Airbnb,\n\nall of these different experiences came up,\n\nwhich is the experiences program,\n\nlike make cheese with this person, go drink wine,\n\nwhich she's young,\n\nwe're not gonna go drink wine with anyone,\n\nbut it genuinely did to me as a user feel like,\n\noh there's like something different is happening here\n\nand now I'm on stage with Brian Chesky\n\nand I can ask him what it is and where it's going.\n\nWhere is this all taking us in terms of Airbnb,\n\nthe core business,\n\nhow we think about it now, you go,\n\nyou book a room or you book a place to stay on vacation\n\nor a business trip,\n\nwhere are we headed?\n\nSo when we started Airbnb\n\nand it originally took off,\n\nI thought we would like expand beyond housing.\n\nI thought we could take the Airbnb model, you know,\n\npeople were saying like the Airbnb for this,\n\nthe Airbnb for that.\n\nThere was an entire ecosystem of startups\n\nstarted around this kind of idea.\n\nAnd I thought that we were gonna do that.\n\nAnd we tried to do it in the early, the 2000 teens,\n\nlike 2014, 15, 16.\n\nAnd it was a little premature.\n\nWe were still in hypergrowth, we weren't really ready.\n\nAnd then of course the pandemic occurred\n\nand then we decided to get back to our foundation.\n\nSo I've looked at a couple companies for inspiration,\n\nmaybe one company that is a decent\n\nreference point is Amazon.\n\nAnd we're a pretty different culture than Amazon, you know,\n\nwe're probably closer in our product development philosophy\n\nto Apple than Amazon,\n\nbut the business that Amazon had in the late nineties,\n\nit was a bookseller\n\nand the only thing you could buy on Amazon was books.\n\nNow books are not nearly as big a market\n\nas vacation rentals.\n\nYou were approaching a hundred billion dollars a year.\n\nBut because books isn't a very big market,\n\nthey had to go into other adjacencies very, very quickly.\n\nAnd so baked in the early days of Amazon\n\nwas what do they do after books?\n\nThey did DVDs and they needed CDs\n\nwhen people used to buy those.\n\nAnd then they moved on and on and on\n\nand eventually they sold everything.\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nif we will sell everything on Airbnb,\n\nbut I think one day you'll be able\n\nto Airbnb a lot more than just an Airbnb,\n\nand you know, we're gonna, you know,\n\nwe don't really disclose ahead of time what we're gonna do,\n\nbut the one thing I've already said\n\nis we are gonna reimagine experiences.\n\nI think it's an underrated product.\n\nPeople generally like it,\n\nbut it never really like caught on.\n\nAnd I think that we can totally reimagine that product\n\nand I'm just like so excited\n\nbecause I very rarely,\n\nlike maybe here's a way of saying it,\n\nlike there are so many founders\n\nthat like they have this idea like,\n\nand if you're lucky, if you're lucky,\n\nyou have an idea and it just takes off.\n\nAnd I was 26, my parents are social workers,\n\nI didn't think I would have an app that ever took off.\n\nAnd my life completely changed.\n\nEverything about my life changed\n\nbecause of this rocket ship I went on,\n\nand I went on this rocket ship\n\nand there's been a couple other dozen people,\n\nif you've like how many people like me are there\n\nthat like go on this rocket ship, a few dozen,\n\nAnd you get to know them, they're at the same conferences,\n\nand you talk to them\n\nand then we all go through this like trough of despair.\n\nMost of us do.\n\nIt's almost like corporate adolescence.\n\nAnd it was probably almost as awkward as my real adolescence\n\nand only a few people,\n\nJensen before us, the greats,\n\nthey get to the other side\n\nand they get an opportunity to have a second act.\n\nThey get an opportunity to reinvent themselves.\n\nAnd that's what I hope next year is the beginning of Airbnb.\n\nI hope it is.\n\nI hope people say that that was one\n\nof the biggest reinventions of a company in recent memory.\n\nReinvention is a big word to use. I'm bookmarking that.\n\n[Brian] Reinvention. That's an aspiration.\n\nI'm gonna be checking in on this.\n\n[Brian] That's an aspiration.\n\nFantastic.\n\nI saw you speaking earlier this year,\n\nit was an off the record session\n\nso I can't share what you said,\n\nbut you talked about sort of your theory\n\nof the case around the value of physical experiences\n\nand the value of physical community.\n\nParticularly in an environment where, you know,\n\nwe're spending a lot of time\n\ntalking about digital experiences, we're talking about AI,\n\nwe're talking about the intridification of the internet,\n\nwhich Jay Graber talked a little bit about earlier.\n\nCan you talk us through a little bit of sort of that,\n\nI mean obviously your company is very well positioned\n\nto capitalize on the resurgence\n\nof physical experience,\n\nbut just give me your,\n\nlike your thesis on that topic, briefly.\n\nLet me, yeah.\n\nSo very briefly, up until two years ago,\n\nvery few people were talking about AI\n\nand then of course Chat GPT launched\n\nand then the generative AI revolution basically started.\n\nAnd while it's been so exciting, I bet you very few of you,\n\nyour daily life has any differences because of AI.\n\nHere's a test, take your phone out,\n\nlook at all the apps in your home screen\n\nand ask what of them have changed two years later\n\nbecause of generative AI.\n\nLike truly changed.\n\nI doubt there are, other than using an AI native app,\n\nI bet you none of the apps you use,\n\nincluding Airbnb are fundamentally\n\ncompletely different in a world of AI.\n\nAnd then ask yourself,\n\nwhat did you do today that was different because of AI,\n\nzero I saw in the audience.\n\nWhat did you,\n\nwhat have you done today or yesterday\n\nthat changed fundamentally because of AI?\n\nMaybe some things,\n\nbut I think it leads to this bigger topic.\n\nI remember when the internet came out like,\n\nand I mean I was born in 1981,\n\nso my memories of the internet were like 1993,\n\nit was before search engines,\n\nand before search engines, some of you might remember,\n\ndo you know how you found a website,\n\nthere was a phone book\n\nand there was this like actual phone book\n\nwith these like websites\n\nand you would say, oh if I wanna learn about this,\n\nyou go to the phone book and you type in the browser.\n\nAnd the reason I say that is I feel like we are in\n\nthe like phone book stage of AI.\n\nWe are still that early\n\nand I think it is starting to begin\n\nto change our digital world,\n\nbut it has not yet changed the most important part\n\nof our lives,\n\nwhich is the physical world.\n\nAnd that's maybe one of the reasons\n\nwhy your life hasn't completely changed by AI\n\nis even when it does change on the phone,\n\nour physical reality is still exactly the same\n\nas it was before.\n\nAnd then the question is,\n\nwell when does the physical world start to change?\n\nOr when does the physical world\n\nstart to be enabled in a completely different way\n\nbecause of AI?\n\nAirbnb's kind of unique because like, you know,\n\nthere's this word that Silicon Valley uses, product,\n\nyou know, you have product managers,\n\nand product managers are basically software managers,\n\nproduct means software,\n\nwhat's our product?\n\nIt's not our app, it's the home, it's the experience,\n\nit's the wine tasting,\n\nit's all these things we're gonna be launching.\n\nSo I am so excited about what we can do\n\nand I think that like AI\n\nand all these different revolutions that are gonna,\n\nI mean certainly AI I think is gonna enable a lot more.\n\nAnd I think if you think about AI, like maybe in a stack,\n\nyou have what Jensen's doing,\n\nwhich is the GPUs on top of, that's the second layer,\n\nwhich is the LLMs.\n\nThere's been a lot of innovation,\n\nbut the world will change at the layer above that.\n\nAnd the layer above, that's the applications.\n\nAnd so when the apps in your phone are totally different,\n\nwe have reached the application layer\n\nand when we reach the application layer,\n\nthe world will completely change.\n\nBut it's kind of like AI is,\n\nthe infrastructure is like the highways.\n\nWe need to still build the cars.\n\nAnd 10 years ago everyone thought\n\nwe'd all be in self-driving cars right now.\n\nAnd there are a bunch on my street.\n\nBut there aren't a lot on a lot of streets.\n\nAnd so I think the point is,\n\nwe overestimate how much technology can change\n\nin the short term,\n\nbut we probably underestimate\n\nhow much it will change in the long term.\n\nAnd it is gonna take some time I think\n\nto permeate the physical world.\n\nBut once it does,\n\nI think it's gonna change everything\n\nand it's not gonna be limited to asking the agent something\n\nand getting an answer.\n\n[Interviewer] Interesting.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nI mean, yeah, I like this vision.\n\nNo it's really, it's interesting.\n\nI mean, is there other technological progress?\n\nI think one of the recurring jokes of this day\n\nis that every session,\n\nthe person in my chair asks the person in your chair\n\nabout AI, right?\n\nThere's a lot of-\n\n[Brian] It was like 1995 you'd say the word internet.\n\n[Interviewer] Right?\n\nYes or as Stephen Levy pointed out earlier,\n\nfive years ago it was the metaverse, right?\n\nIs there other technological progress,\n\nwhether it affects your company\n\nor whether it's just something you are seeing\n\nas a leader in the tech industry\n\nthat you think is really salient,\n\nthat you think is important,\n\nthat you think maybe has implications for Airbnb\n\nthat we are not talking about\n\nbecause we are spending so much time talking about AI?\n\nOr is AI really deservedly sucking up\n\nthis much oxygen?\n\n[Brian] I mean maybe the way to think,\n\nI mean there are so many different technologies\n\nthat will probably impact the world.\n\nMaybe the way to think about it is that AI will be enabler,\n\nyou know,\n\nI think that like one part of AI\n\nthat I think will be massive\n\nis when AI can do software development.\n\nBecause I think like right now,\n\nlike there are only so many people\n\nthat can like hire software engineers.\n\nLike a small ski company can't have a like a,\n\ncan't have an app,\n\nbecause they can't hire engineers.\n\nBut when software development\n\nbecomes much more like prompting,\n\nthen software can be completely ubiquitous.\n\nAnd as software's completely ubiquitous,\n\nthen suddenly the physical world can start to change,\n\n'cause everything could have software in it.\n\nAnd so that's just like a very small example.\n\nSo I think that AI is an accelerant.\n\nI don't know,\n\nI think a lot of times when we say AI\n\nand we say like AI is gonna change the world,\n\nI wonder if we're using AI,\n\nwe're really saying is technology,\n\nI wonder if we're just saying that technological progress\n\nis going to speed up\n\nand that the next 20 years are gonna feel like the last 50.\n\nAnd that probably is true,\n\nand it probably is in large part for AI,\n\nbut AI is built on a lot of other technologies.\n\nAnd so if AI is built on other technologies,\n\nthen wouldn't other new technologies emerge\n\nthat are built on AI that will also accelerate technology?\n\nAnd so I just think that there's gonna be a huge amount\n\nof technological progress.\n\nAnd I'm not like a,\n\nI'm a designer at heart, not a technologist,\n\nso I'm not probably the best person to ask\n\nwhat the specific technologies are.\n\nBut I think when we say AI,\n\nI think sometimes or AGI,\n\nthink we kind of mean technological progress.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah, yeah.\n\n[Brian] Make sense?\n\nI think AGI is at the center of it,\n\nbut it's gonna probably lead to the,\n\nthere's gonna be a lot of other developments.\n\nLike AI is only possible with like,\n\nprocessing power increasing and like, you know,\n\nlike AI is gonna lead to discovery\n\nof a lot of new areas\n\nand a lot of new fields that are gonna be self-reinforcing.\n\nYeah, no, it makes sense.\n\nWe have a few minutes left.\n\nI wanted to make sure to spend a little bit\n\nof time on your leadership style.\n\nI was telling you backstage\n\nthat of all of sort of the tech CEOs,\n\nthe leaders in this industry,\n\nI see Brian Chesky's name associated the most\n\nwith leadership advice tidbits of, you know,\n\nyou no longer believe in one-on-one meetings,\n\nit's founder mode, baby.\n\nLike, it's just,\n\nit's all this sort of noise about how you run your company\n\nand how you sort of have evolved as a leader,\n\nyour sort of theory of leadership.\n\nWhich brings me to the question,\n\nnot so much about leadership advice,\n\nI kind of wanna know what a day in the life\n\nof Brian Chesky is like,\n\nlike a work day.\n\nYou know, when you think about founder mode,\n\nsweating the small stuff, being in the details,\n\nnot sort of trusting,\n\nnot sort of delegating and operating\n\nin sort of manager mode.\n\nWhat does that look like every day?\n\nI ask as a manager and someone who really-\n\nThat's great question by the way,\n\nlike I love this,\n\nthis term founder mode has become pretty ubiquitous,\n\nand yet most like I know, Paul Graham-\n\nIt's not, you didn't say it.\n\n[Brian] It wasn't, Paul Graham said it,\n\nand he never actually explained what it was.\n\nAnd one time when it like first went viral,\n\nsomebody said,\n\nI'm going founder mode on this burrito.\n\nAnd yeah that was-\n\n[Interviewer] It's so good.\n\nThat was the moment I realized\n\nwe probably should clarify what this means.\n\nOtherwise, like I don't,\n\n'cause otherwise I feel bad for the burrito.\n\nYeah, it is a little bit threatening.\n\nI think it means a lot of things,\n\nbut just to be very simple, like at its crux,\n\nI think it means to be in the details.\n\nI think it means that great leadership is presence,\n\nnot absence.\n\nAnd I think a lot of us are taught to delegate,\n\nbecause the opposite of delegation\n\nis this horrible ill\n\nthat you can commit to on your employs,\n\nwhich is micromanagement.\n\nAnd no one wants to be a micromanager.\n\nNo one good wants to work for a micromanager.\n\nAnd I think it's way more nuanced than that.\n\nI remember there was an executive\n\nthat once asked me,\n\nIs this your decision or is this my decision?\n\nAnd I kind of exaggerated when I said this,\n\nbut I kind of said like,\n\nit should never be either.\n\nIn other words, everything is a dialogue.\n\nIt's a partnership.\n\nIt's not about me telling you what to do\n\nand it's not about you doing your own thing,\n\nit's about being involved.\n\nAnd the way I basically spend my time\n\nis I basically review the work.\n\nI basically say like,\n\nI don't like managers,\n\nand I put managers in quotes,\n\nmeaning people who manage the people absent the work.\n\nLike if you're not managing the work,\n\nwhat are you doing all day?\n\nAre you like doing one-on-ones?\n\nAre you acting like their therapist?\n\nAre you dealing with bureaucracy all day?\n\nAnd so I think the best way\n\nto manage people is through the work.\n\nAnd that's actually how they learn.\n\nThey learn by doing, by watching,\n\nand you mentor them through the work.\n\nSo what I do all day is I basically review work.\n\nSo like every day is a little bit different,\n\nbut I might wake up\n\nand like every Sunday night\n\nI have a head of program management at Airbnb,\n\nprogram management, unlike most companies,\n\nis a tier one function.\n\nAnd they basically,\n\nwe have 75 to 80 projects that I'm monitoring\n\nand I review every project\n\nand the company that's customer facing.\n\nAnd I review everything every week, every two weeks,\n\nevery four weeks, every eight weeks,\n\nthere's like a cadence\n\nand I'll probably do like 30 hours of reviews\n\nand maybe that's like approximately half of my schedule.\n\nI don't know exactly how many hours I work,\n\nMaybe some weeks I work more than that, but,\n\nand so I'll basically be in reviews.\n\nAnd so the reason I don't do one-on-one meetings,\n\nI mean if somebody needs to talk to me,\n\nI'll talk to them and I do a lot of calls.\n\nI'll call somebody and I'll ask 'em a question.\n\nWhat I don't do is recurring scheduled one-on-ones\n\nwhere the employee owns the agenda.\n\nAnd I find, I know Jensen said he doesn't do that either.\n\nAnd what I do is I basically run the company in groups,\n\ngroup meetings where I'm reviewing work\n\nand I have the boss, like the person doing the work,\n\ntheir boss, their boss and their boss.\n\nSo no one can ever have to go,\n\nno one ever has to go up the chain to get to me.\n\nYou could get to me in front of everyone\n\nand I'll ask everyone's opinion\n\nand then I might disagree with them,\n\nbut I'll like ask them to talk me out of it,\n\nchange my mind.\n\nAnd that's probably the main thing I do.\n\nIn other words, a simple way I run a company,\n\nis we have a release, a big product release,\n\nwe set a big goal\n\nand then we review the work every few weeks\n\ntowards that goal.\n\nAnd we're either on track or we're either off track.\n\nAnd if I'm not doing that,\n\nI'm probably trying to find great people\n\nto work on the next thing.\n\nAnd by hiring them, developing talent or promoting them.\n\nWho do you lean on as a leader? Who do you learn from?\n\nWho do you look up to?\n\nI mean, it changes,\n\nbecause when I was starting out I like,\n\nI think my investors,\n\nwhich were my board members,\n\ntaught me a lot.\n\nI had Reid Hoffman and Mark Andreessen on the board\n\nand you know,\n\nand then eventually Alfred Lynn\n\nand I had all these different people join the board\n\nand your investors are kind of like your mentors.\n\nThen I started learning from the executives I hired,\n\nI hired these executives and I learned from them.\n\nThen I started learning,\n\nI became like shameless about seeking out other CEOs.\n\nSo like I went to this conference called Sun Valley,\n\nall the like big shots of Silicon Valley were there,\n\nso I would,\n\nI like remember one time like there's this duck pond outside\n\nof Sun Valley and I like,\n\nit's like a pond with all these ducks,\n\nand I was chasing Jeff, not chasing,\n\nbut like trying to practically chase Jeff Bezos down\n\nto get advice from him in the duck pond.\n\nNo it's a good visual, let's go with that.\n\nAnd so I would, people like that,\n\nand now I, you know,\n\nlast night I had a dinner with like 20 other founders\n\nof companies like Airbnb size\n\nor maybe a little smaller,\n\nsome were a little bigger,\n\nand I do a lot of like,\n\nwe do a lot of comparing notes now\n\nand we were talking about like how we run our companies\n\nand I do look at like historical references.\n\nI think Walt Disney and Steve Jobs I like in particular\n\nbecause they were creative people\n\nrunning technology companies.\n\nI think of myself like that.\n\nSo those are kind of who I learn and lean on.\n\n[Interviewer] That's interesting,\n\ninteresting to hear about how it has evolved over the years.\n\nAnd speaking of time,\n\nwe are coming to the end of ours,\n\nand as you are the last speaker of the day,\n\nwe've asked a couple folks this throughout the day,\n\nbut parting words from Brian Chesky,\n\nwhat I wanna know\n\nand what I think you could leave everyone here with is,\n\nthat little bit of optimism I promised all of you\n\nat the beginning of the day,\n\nBrian, what gives you hope?\n\nWhat makes you feel optimistic?\n\nWhat can these fine people\n\ntake away from you today?\n\nOh, that's a great question.\n\nMaybe I can put it in the context\n\nof like what's happening in the world today.\n\n[Interviewer] Yeah.\n\nI don't know if people today in this world\n\nare super optimistic\n\nor that's, first of all,\n\nthere seems to be a lot of despair.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of pessimism.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of division.\n\nI mean, I remember when I came to Silicon Valley\n\nthere was another election going on, 2008.\n\nSenator Barack Obama against Senator McCain.\n\nAnd in hindsight they both looked a lot more purple\n\nthan the kind of red and blue divide of today.\n\nI mean, to give you an example,\n\nlike we sold collectible cereal boxes\n\nand we had like this Barack Obama themed cereal\n\nwith this John McCain theme cereal,\n\nyou know the outrage there would've been\n\nif we had like Trump and Harris cereal,\n\nlike both sides would've been completely,\n\nhow dare you make cereal by the other candidate.\n\nThat is how divided we are.\n\nAnd I'm like pretty concerned about that.\n\nBut I wanna bring it just back to Airbnb,\n\n'cause that's like kind of my only point of reference.\n\nWhen I started Airbnb with my two friends,\n\nI remember telling one of the first people\n\nI told about the idea\n\nand he looked at me with a straight face,\n\nBrian, I said, Yes?\n\nHe goes,\n\nI hope that's not the only idea you're working on.\n\nAnd the reason he said that,\n\nand it was, you know,\n\nlike a completely reasonable rational thought\n\nis he said strangers will never trust one another.\n\nThey'll never be able to do this.\n\nAnd I've learned since that day,\n\nmore than 2 billion people have stayed in the Airbnb\n\nand 220 countries and regions in a hundred thousand cities.\n\nAnd people have asked me,\n\nwell what have you learned about human nature\n\nbecause of these 2 billion people staying together?\n\nAnd I said,\n\nI think what I've learned\n\nis that at some fundamental level,\n\npeople are fundamentally good and we're 99.9% the same.\n\nAnd I think that we live in these echo chambers\n\nand these bubbles where we other everyone\n\nand we tend to identify as one group\n\nand then everyone else becomes the other group.\n\nAnd I think one of the best ways\n\nto change your mind about someone, I mean first of all,\n\nno one's ever changed someone else's mind\n\nin the YouTube comment section.\n\n[Interviewer] Not yet.\n\nI guarantee you, I guarantee you,\n\nhere's a way to change someone else's mind.\n\nLike have them walk in your shoes or walk in their shoes.\n\nAnd there's many ways to do that,\n\nand one way is, you know,\n\nobviously to be minorly solicitous,\n\nlike stay in Airbnb.\n\nBut we're not the only way.\n\nBut like get out into the world,\n\nmeet the kind of people you disagree with,\n\nand you'll start to realize\n\nthat they're not so different than you\n\nat some fundamental level.\n\nAnd when you start to believe that,\n\nand if you believe we're in the phone book era of AI,\n\nthat we're about to have the biggest engine\n\nfor curiosity and possibility in the world.\n\nAnd that technology can permeate the physical world.\n\nAnd if we can get out people back into the physical world\n\nconnecting back together with one another,\n\nI think that's the ultimate promise of the internet.\n\nThat the internet was always meant to bring us together.\n\nBut I think the physical version\n\nof bringing us together is in the physical world,\n\nwhy is everyone here physically here right now?\n\nYou could just watch YouTube videos,\n\nbut you all chose to come here.\n\nAnd I think that's what I'm optimistic about.\n\nI'm optimistic that I think this is maybe\n\none of the greatest times in human history to be alive,\n\nwith one of the biggest technological revolutions\n\nin front of us,\n\nand if we can just see besides our differences,\n\nwe can come together\n\nand I think we can create\n\nsuch a wonderful world together.\n\nAnd when I say world, I mean a real world,\n\na physical world that we can live in together.\n\n[audience clapping]\n\nI hope we see that come to pass.\n\nBrian, thank you so much.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you.\n\n[audience clapping]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nSo I'm really delighted to welcome Dylan Field\n\nto The Big Interview stage.\n\nHe's the co-founder and CEO of Figma.\n\nAs a student of Brown University,\n\nhe and his co-founder Evan Wallace began experimenting\n\nwith design tools built on and for the web,\n\nand with funding from a Teal fellowship,\n\nmaybe we'll talk about that, they began Figma.\n\nHis previous jobs were internships,\n\nincluding at LinkedIn.\n\nFigma has millions of users,\n\nthey run a big developer conference called Config,\n\nand lightly they've been very creative in integrating\n\nAI into their product.\n\nLike you had a choice, right?\n\nAnd welcome Dylan Field.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nSteven, WIRED, Thank you for having me.\n\nAnd also really great to be back here at Config,\n\nour first Config,\n\nwhich was just weeks before the pandemic,\n\nwas actually here at the Midway.\n\nAnd so it's very exciting to be back and good energy.\n\nWell, great to have you back, though.\n\nI have to say, I've got a comment on what you're wearing.\n\nYou are the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.\n\nWhy are you wearing an Enron hoodie?\n\nAll right, well, first of all,\n\none thing that people don't know enough of is\n\nthat the Enron logo was designed by Paul Rand,\n\nwhich I'm sure some of us know.\n\nPaul Rand was an amazing brand designer responsible\n\nfor many different corporate entities,\n\nincluding IBM, the NeXT Cube,\n\nand his last one actually was the Enron logo,\n\nand it was the final project he worked on.\n\nIt was released after his death.\n\nAnd you might say it had a short shelf life.\n\nIt went from what I think actually is a quite timeless logo\n\nto being called the crooked E.\n\nAnd one thing that happened yesterday,\n\nwhich I thought I got a real kick out of,\n\nwas somebody actually acquired the right to the Enron brand,\n\nand they did a relaunch on the anniversary\n\nof the bankruptcy.\n\nAnd to me, I kind of think this is fascinating\n\nbecause it brings up all sorts of questions\n\nfor a new generation\n\nthat didn't necessarily have all the associations\n\nwith Enron as others did,\n\ncan you actually make a new brand,\n\na new company out of that material?\n\nAnd for me, I was,\n\nI think it was 2001 when Enron went bankrupt.\n\nI was nine years old, I was reading the newspaper\n\naware that there's like really bad stuff happening,\n\naware that there are brownouts,\n\nbut I definitely don't have those same associations\n\nas a lot of others do.\n\nAnd I find the whole thing very fascinating.\n\nSo that's why I'm wearing the sweatshirt.\n\nSo in other words,\n\nyou're not getting the negative implications,\n\nof which there are some of Enron,\n\nbut it's just like a kind of a cool gangster thing,\n\nthat aspect of it.\n\nAttached to a logo which you bonded to there,\n\nis this always an appreciation of that stuff you had,\n\nbecause you were in college,\n\nyou were doing math and science.\n\nThen you get this fellowship\n\nthat basically tells people get out of college,\n\nbuild something.\n\nAnd you gravitate towards design.\n\nIs this something you were always interested in,\n\nor would you just see that as a gap, an opportunity?\n\nYeah, I was always interested in design.\n\nNot always very good at design\n\nbecause are two different things,\n\nyour taste versus your ability.\n\nThere's a lot of good famous quotes about that.\n\nBut for me, I mean,\n\nI was always fascinated with how things worked,\n\nthe user experience of things,\n\nand also graphics and how you actually could use interfaces\n\nonline and the web as well as desktop software.\n\nI grew up playing things like Incredible Tune Machine,\n\nthen eventually things like Neopets\n\nwere big influences for me in my childhood.\n\nAnd the design aspects of those\n\nand how they worked were endlessly fascinating.\n\nBut yeah, it took a while to get to Figma.\n\nI started the company because my co-founder\n\nand I were excited about WebGL.\n\nAnd we thought that that was definitely an opportunity,\n\nthe ability to use the GPU in your computer in the browser.\n\nAnd if we could start to do that, what could you make?\n\nWe thought there's really two things\n\nthat could be interesting.\n\nOne is games and the other might be tools.\n\nAnd we thought, okay, games is a hit-based business\n\nthat is incredibly hard to do the right way.\n\nWe're not gonna go there.\n\nInstead we said, Let's go explore the space of tools.\n\nAnd we started to explore,\n\nI'd actually just been a design intern at Flipboard,\n\nand they had an incredible design team there,\n\nand were really ahead of their time in terms\n\nof the premium they put on design.\n\nThey thought about design as part of something\n\nthat everyone in the company contributed to\n\nand was the reason that they stood out as a business.\n\nAnd despite that, it still took a while for us\n\nto get back to design because we thought\n\nit was a tiny market.\n\nAnd it turned out that the more we learned about it,\n\nthe more we looked into it,\n\nwe started to realize\n\nthat this was an exponential trend of not only\n\nhow much software is created in the world,\n\nbut also the importance of design in that context.\n\nAnd that design was the way that you stand out.\n\nAnd what's interesting now\n\nI think in this age of AI\n\nthat we find ourselves in is that it feels like\n\nthat's even more true than ever.\n\nBoth the exponential trend of software,\n\nI mean it's going straight vertical now,\n\nbut also this idea that craft of design being the way\n\nthat companies will stand out in this age of software,\n\nI think is more important than it's ever been too.\n\nAnd also the ratios, I think that when we started Figma,\n\nthe ratio of designers to engineers\n\nwere sort of off the charts.\n\nAnd that was much better than it had been 10 years prior.\n\nAnd we started to see improvements in those ratios\n\neven over the first five years of Figma.\n\nI think if you look to the future,\n\nit might be that the ratio flips even,\n\nthat there's more people\n\nthat are doing things that look like design\n\nthan people that are actually building the code.\n\nAnd so I'm fascinated to see\n\nwhat that'll look like in the future.\n\nWell, one of the pillars of Figma is\n\nthere's this paradigm of collaboration in design.\n\nNow Paul Rand, who you idolize,\n\nhe didn't have to collaborate with anyone.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs tried to stick his nose in\n\nto the process when he was doing the NeXT design,\n\nhe said, Get out of here.\n\nHe said, It's either take it or leave it.\n\nIf you don't like it,\n\nI'll take my $100,000 and go home.\n\nDid you have trouble pitching that\n\nto generations of designers who are used\n\nto that kind of data attitude?\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nThere's I think this mindset that agencies had\n\nwhere it was sort of,\n\nthere's a grand reveal and a black box\n\nthat the process is in.\n\nAnd when we launched Figma,\n\nI remember the comments were something like,\n\nIf this is the future of design, I'm changing careers.\n\nThat was one comment we got.\n\nAnother comment that always stuck with me was,\n\nA camel is a horse designed by committee.\n\nAnd what we've found is\n\nbecause design is so central to how a business works,\n\nand also if you win or lose,\n\nnot only does everyone have an opinion,\n\nand you could say, the more opinions, the worse it gets.\n\nBut I actually find that if you're able to make it so\n\nthat everyone can come together and see the best ideas\n\nand you can visualize them quickly,\n\nwhich I think will become more possible in the age of AI,\n\nthen you're able to kind of create a level playing field.\n\nAnd maybe for brand and marks\n\nlike Paul Rand created\n\nwhere you have to really be so strongly opinionated,\n\nthat's a different sort of beast altogether.\n\nBut when it comes to thinking through user flows,\n\nthinking through how a product experience should work\n\nand how a business should win,\n\noftentimes that really helps the strategy.\n\nSo what you said before\n\nlinks to something else that you've said,\n\nbecause creativity is the new productivity, right?\n\nCan you explain that?\n\nMy sense is that people are trying\n\nto visually express themselves much more than before.\n\nAnd also that there's a new paradigm possible\n\nwhen you've got an infinite visual canvas.\n\nAnd with an infinite visual canvas,\n\nwhether it's in a whiteboard tool,\n\nwe offer something called FigJam, or even in a slide deck,\n\nand we have Figma Slides now too,\n\nbeing able to show great visual work\n\ncan really help bring people along.\n\nAnd I think that the more creative you can be,\n\nthe more you can stand out,\n\nwhether it's inside of an organization\n\nor it's on the outside of an organization\n\nand in your marketing, your product,\n\nthe ways that you'll stand out to customers.\n\nSo if millions of people are using Figma,\n\nwhich they are, right?\n\nYou're not telling me how many millions,\n\nbut it's fair to say millions,\n\nthen if everything looks good, then how do you stand out?\n\nIsn't you raising the bar\n\nmaking it actually tougher to be distinct?\n\nYeah, I think that it's not just about how it looks,\n\nbut also how it works, of course.\n\nBut I believe that there's things\n\nthat the best designers are doing today\n\nin terms of interactivity, dynamism, motion,\n\nand just unique experiences that they're creating,\n\nwhich very few people are able to do.\n\nBut I hope that we can do two things.\n\nI hope that we can, partially with our tools,\n\nbut also partially with AI,\n\nand really they're the same thing.\n\nWe can lower the floor,\n\nmake it so that more people can participate\n\nin the process of design, but also raise the ceiling,\n\nmake it so that more people,\n\nwhether they're new to design\n\nor outside the world of design\n\nor they wouldn't classify themselves that way,\n\nor they're new designers can raise the ceiling\n\non their work.\n\nAnd they can make it so that they're able to match the work\n\nof some of the best designers in the world.\n\nAnd they're limited more by their ideas\n\nthan by the tools in front of them.\n\nSo Dylan, the first time we spoke,\n\nI know we had a great meeting\n\nand went out for coffee\n\nand you were telling me how\n\nI'm never gonna sell out this company,\n\nwe're gonna go it alone, we're gonna like build on that.\n\nAnd it was like maybe two months later,\n\nAdobe is gonna buy your company for $20 billion.\n\nI felt so bad when I told you that.\n\nI felt like,\n\nif you've ever had a one-on-one conversation with Steven,\n\nyou'll know how he stares into your soul.\n\nAnd I had just gotten off a call\n\nwith Adobe literally minutes before.\n\nWhat a poker player. Unbelievable.\n\nNo no no. I was petrified.\n\nI was like, did he hear? Anyway, I'm still sorry.\n\nOkay, well don't drop the subject.\n\n[Dylan] Just feel bad, that's all.\n\nI mean was this the kind of thing\n\nwhere you felt it's an offer I can't refuse?\n\nOr is it something you felt,\n\ngee, this is generally gonna be better for my customers\n\nand to grow what we want to do?\n\nYeah, I was honestly quite excited.\n\nI think it was something that to me,\n\nespecially as we explored it further,\n\nand that was still early in the process.\n\nAnd so I think we're going back and forth,\n\nbut I was excited about the possibilities\n\nwe could have inside of Adobe.\n\nWhat we could do there in terms\n\nof taking the multiplayer tech,\n\nthe way that we brought our product to the web\n\nand doing that for more of the Adobe ecosystem\n\nand the change we could create there.\n\nAnd I thought it was a good outcome,\n\nnot only for our customers,\n\nwhich honestly most negotiation was about\n\nhow to make sure our customers would end up in a great place\n\nand be beneficial for them,\n\nbut also for all the stakeholders around the company.\n\nSo yeah, I was excited and that's why we went after it.\n\nAnd obviously because regulators here and abroad\n\nsaid they were not gonna look kindly on this,\n\nthat went fizzle.\n\nAnd you're left with a company on your own again,\n\nyou have an extra billion dollars\n\nfor a breakup fee.\n\nBut I'm sure you had your plans\n\nand it was a distraction,\n\nbut then you get to concentrate on AI there.\n\nSo walk me through a little bit of your journey\n\nabout how you're building, you know,\n\nit's available now in open betas and things,\n\nAI into what you do.\n\nAbsolutely, so yeah,\n\nwe're wildly excited about just all the opportunities ahead.\n\nAnd I think that as we think about the future\n\nof Figma and what it can become,\n\nI mean we started off as a design tool where\n\na third of our users, weekly active users are designers,\n\nthird are developers,\n\nand third are kind of in the other category.\n\nAnd we found these folks were coming into the product\n\nand then we started to build out from there.\n\nWe created FigJam, we created Figma Slides, now Dev Mode.\n\nAnd we're really trying to make this platform\n\nwhere you can go and create products and do that end to end.\n\nAnd as I think about what AI enables through that,\n\nI get excited about these different transitions\n\nbetween abstractions.\n\nHow can you go from a brainstorm file to a slide deck,\n\nor a slide deck to a design file,\n\na design file to working code?\n\nThat becomes more possible in a world of AI,\n\nbut also the ability to improve\n\nthe way that you explore this idea maze.\n\nWe're all kind of in the design process\n\nthinking about all these different possibilities\n\nthat could exist.\n\nHow do you go rapidly navigate that?\n\nThink about the things that could be, evaluate them quickly,\n\nand then see if you wanna go down that path\n\nand really refine it and bring all the craft to it,\n\nor if you can discard that possibility.\n\nAnd if you could do that across that entire process quickly\n\nand bring those two things together, it's super powerful.\n\nAnd that's where I think you can,\n\nI guess both lower the floor but also raise the ceiling\n\nand make it so that in the sort of end state,\n\neven though there's so much more software in the world,\n\nthe software we have that stands out can be so much better.\n\nIt seems to me, the way I understand,\n\nand correct me if I'm wrong,\n\nthere's sort of two paths that you're pursuing on AI.\n\nOne is just to improve the flow,\n\nto use AI the way some of us will use ChatGPT\n\nto fill in things and automate certain kinds of things\n\nand just like make...\n\nAnd it's all once search through things you already have,\n\njust things that make it go smoother\n\nand take drudgery away.\n\nThe second is almost to build a collaborator\n\nto the creative process.\n\nAnd that's where things get interesting\n\nand a little questionable.\n\nLike where did this stuff come from?\n\nAnd you had one experience,\n\nyou had a product that\n\nmaybe you could explain it briefly,\n\nbut I mean, I don't know have we time to really get into it,\n\nultimately someone used something\n\nthat wound up looking a lot like Apple's weather app\n\nand you had to make an adjustment.\n\nSo rather than dive into that,\n\nthere is this gray area of whether people should contribute\n\nto the training sets.\n\nYou're transparent about that,\n\nbut some people wanna do that.\n\nThey want to contribute to the community.\n\nOther people are very protective. There's lawsuits.\n\nSo where you stand on that?\n\nDo you feel that we're gonna be a blend of the creativity\n\nthat comes from this cloud\n\nof what comes from training sets and us,\n\nor will people draw firmer lines as this goes along?\n\nSo it's interesting\n\nbecause when we launched this Make Design feature,\n\nwhich we later called First Draft\n\nbecause we thought that was more representative\n\nof the actual value that we were creating,\n\nthis is the first draft that you're gonna iterate on,\n\nwe did it in a way that was more generic.\n\nAnd what we found in the feedback we received\n\nwas actually design companies have a design system already.\n\nThey have a system that they rely on\n\nof a kit of parts of all their styles,\n\ntheir components that they want to use.\n\nSo they don't want an arbitrary thing.\n\nAnd what they do want from us\n\nis the ability to quickly explore\n\nand make variations using their own design system.\n\nSo I think first of all, most likely,\n\na lot of those outputs on the generative side\n\nare more unique to companies and organizations\n\nthan they are matching the general universe of design.\n\nBut it is important to be able to do all sorts\n\nof other functionality as well.\n\nAnd I think where training comes in is making it\n\nso that we're able to explore that.\n\nThings like if you're in Gmail for example,\n\nand you start typing and you see auto-suggested text\n\nand you can press Tab to complete it,\n\nlike what's the design tool equivalent of that?\n\nWhat makes it so that you can remove drudgery,\n\nthe things that people don't want to do,\n\nand put people into more of a flow state,\n\nmake them more creative\n\nand make it so that they can explore\n\neven more options faster?\n\nIf we can do that, then that I think is really exciting.\n\nYeah, that's great.\n\nBut I guess my fear is\n\nyou're doing great work in democratizing design,\n\nso you add AI to the mix,\n\nthere's people who are gonna\n\nlike raise the floor to do that, to make things look good.\n\nBut we've already seen what good enough does in ChatGPT\n\nand we're inundated with AI slop,\n\nand I guess it's sort of my nightmare\n\nthat this stuff looks better and draws us in even more.\n\nYeah, I think that it's interesting,\n\nwhen I look back at the history of Figma,\n\nthere was a moment where, I don't know, 2014, 2015,\n\nwhere I realized some of the negative effects\n\nof the power of design.\n\nI remember later in the night\n\nreading about the time ISIS was\n\na really important challenge\n\nthat we were facing globally.\n\nAnd there was a magazine they put out\n\nwhich was really horrific\n\nand it was incredibly well-designed.\n\nAnd designed as a power to lift\n\nbad actors as well as, that's extreme case obviously,\n\nas well as stuff that maybe just be like not as interesting.\n\nAnd I think that that is the reality\n\nof all tools is they have the power\n\nif they're made correctly to lift people up.\n\nAnd that's a debate that you can have\n\nI think about any tool.\n\nBut what I think is most important is\n\nthat we find ways to recognize that most\n\nof the AI tools right now are about lowering the floor.\n\nThey're about making it so that there's democratization.\n\nDemocratization is great in many ways\n\nand new use cases and markets aren't locked.\n\nYou talk to the people that do image generation\n\nwith diffusion models, not all of them are doing the things\n\nthat you expect.\n\nSome of them are doing like art therapy,\n\nwhich is never possible before.\n\nBut I also think it's so critical for us\n\nto really invest in, like I said,\n\nraising the ceiling and making these new possibilities\n\nfor designers.\n\nAnd that's where a lot of our thinking is right now.\n\nAnd that's where I hope we can drive towards.\n\nI'd love to go on, that's a great place to stop.\n\nThank you, Dylan. Thank you.\n\n[audience applauding]",

[intense music]\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nI know that you have been thinking\n\nabout doing a first-person book,\n\nsome sort of autobiography, for many, many years.\n\nI talked to you about it like 30 years ago maybe.\n\nWhy do that now?\n\nI hired Rob Gupt to help me dig out all the old facts,\n\nget the report cards, and go talk to all of my friends\n\nand colleagues from early days.\n\nSo yes, it's a project we've been working on for some time.\n\nIt was only about 18 months ago\n\nthat we decided taking this first phase of my life,\n\nabout 25 years, right as I start Microsoft,\n\nand doing a book where my parents, my upbringing,\n\nthe luck of what I was exposed to, that was the whole story.\n\nAnd once that idea came up, I got quite enthused about it,\n\nbecause we weren't getting into the current stuff\n\nwhere there's still a lot not figured out.\n\nI mean, the foundation's goals are ongoing.\n\nEven Microsoft, although I play a modest role as an advisor,\n\nthe AI stuff is of course very, very much ongoing.\n\nAnd so it was really fun to take this period\n\nand try and explain how amazing my father was, my mother,\n\nmy sisters, just a huge variety of things\n\nthat got me to be kind of forward looking.\n\nAnd by the time I'm 20 years old,\n\nI found myself more enmeshed in programming and the magic\n\nof what programming could do than almost anyone.\n\nSo I love the way it's come out,\n\nthat we just do this first 25-year period,\n\nwhich we're calling Source Code.\n\nAnd then another book can take the whole Microsoft story.\n\nAnd then a different one can take the philanthropic work\n\nand contemplate that.\n\nWell, by doing that, by breaking that out,\n\nit becomes way more personal\n\nthan anything that we've seen from you.\n\nPeople like me have been pounding you, asking you questions.\n\nWhen can these self-reflectives?\n\nAnd you've done it here.\n\nI know that you admire the Agassi book by J.R. Moehringer.\n\nI don't know whether you considered him to be a co-writer.\n\nIs that a thought you might have?\n\nNo, we, I mean, we had our team pretty early on.\n\nBut that's a great book.\n\nBut you, in a way, went on there\n\nand you held a mirror to yourself.\n\nThis is very much a bildungsroman,\n\nlike a coming-of-age story.\n\nAnd sometimes the mirror didn't portray\n\nsuch a flattering image, did it?\n\nI mean, I had my ups and downs.\n\nI had conflicts with my parents.\n\nI had, I was using Harvard computer time,\n\nand they were confused about what I was doing.\n\nThe first customer, you had MITS, we had a complex contract.\n\nWe ended up in a dispute, surprisingly, with them.\n\nMy relationship with Paul is a very central piece\n\nof how Microsoft comes together,\n\nand Paul and I are working together super well,\n\nand then disagreeing.\n\nSo yes, between my parents and Paul.\n\nAnd I had a lot of uncertainty,\n\neven though the software thing,\n\nthere were many experiences that made that\n\njust such a unique thing that, wow,\n\nwhy do I see this when other people don't see it.\n\nBut yeah, it's hopefully a very human story.\n\nIt's not immaculate conception.\n\nWell, it is a human story,\n\nand I think one where it gets to very emotional ground.\n\nI remember I did a profile of you, I think in 1999.\n\nAnd your father told me a little bit\n\nabout some of the stuff in here,\n\nand he said your mother was traumatized by the situation.\n\nYou wouldn't talk for days on end.\n\nYou say yourself that the things that really interested you\n\nwere like reading, and math, and being inside your own head,\n\nand in some ways you weren't kind to your parents.\n\nAnd I think unrolling some instances like that,\n\nyou seem a little remorseful.\n\nWell, I give both of my parents, each in their own way,\n\na lot of credit for how they shaped me.\n\nYou know, with my dad, it was much more setting an example\n\nof always being serious about his work,\n\nof sharing anecdotes.\n\nWith my mom, it was far more intense, that,\n\nOh, you didn't get up here as soon as I wanted,\n\nor, Your table manners weren't as good as I wanted.\n\nSo yeah, in the case of my mom, I was often falling short.\n\nShe did get me to interact with the adults that were around.\n\nThat was a skill that became quite valuable for me.\n\nSo she helped compliment my intense desire\n\nto study and understand things.\n\nBut yeah, the tension between my mom and I was,\n\nshe was always pushing for me to do better,\n\nand eventually proud of what I achieved.\n\nBut that was a complex relationship.\n\nVery amazing, I mean, my mom was a phenomenal person,\n\nnot just her social skills,\n\nor her ambition for herself, her husband, and me,\n\nbut just, she was a special person.\n\nClearly there was a lot of love,\n\nbut they were at their wit's end\n\nto figure out what to do with you.\n\nTowards the end of the book, you say something that,\n\nyou say if this were today you would've been diagnosed,\n\nyou said, probably, on the autism spectrum.\n\nWhat led you to that conclusion?\n\nWhen did you start thinking about that?\n\nWell, I know when I was growing up, this idea that they,\n\nI would go and talk to a therapist\n\nwas actually quite an unusual thing.\n\nAnd this guy, Dr. Cressey, who really got me thinking about,\n\nokay, what was I trying to achieve\n\nin this conflict with my parents.\n\nDid I really have some thought in mind\n\nor was I just trying to make trouble?\n\nThat was, I think, quite unusual.\n\nBut back then, the idea that kids were very different,\n\nand there some kind of interventions,\n\nthat just wasn't commonplace at all.\n\nI was clearly somewhat hyperactive.\n\nI could concentrate a great deal.\n\nI think, in fact, I did get to see that therapist was good.\n\nWho knows what it would've been like?\n\nKids are much more looked over.\n\nThe thing where I was able to go off to the computer center,\n\nor even spend all that time alone,\n\neven going out on those hikes,\n\npeople are protective enough, they might view a lot of that.\n\nYeah, you describe these epic, crazy hikes\n\nthat you wouldn't think of sending a 12-year-old\n\nor 13-year-old today.\n\nThey were super dangerous.\n\nYeah, even though now you'd have a GPS tracker.\n\nWell, has that realization sort of shaped you?\n\nYou're a super curious person.\n\nCuriosity is something that runs through this book.\n\nHave you like pursued the curiosity about that,\n\nin terms of understanding yourself?\n\nWell, I do, even at this age, I love learning new things,\n\nand I view all of my work as kind of being a student,\n\nand super lucky, not just the things I get to read, but.\n\nAnd these days you can learn so easily.\n\nAnd then I get access to experts.\n\nI mean, when I'm confused about AI,\n\nSam Altman gets 10 people together and we sit and talk.\n\nI'm very lucky that my career path has meant\n\nthat my deep curiosity, I've been able to maintain it.\n\nAnd I think it is part of my success,\n\nis really wanting to understand things in a pretty deep way.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nAnother thing which struck me, reading the book,\n\nis I knew you came from a well-off family.\n\nAnd something, again, you refer to\n\ntowards the end of the book,\n\nhow much privilege is part of your story.\n\nYou say, I was like a white male\n\nthat's in a privileged position.\n\nBut your family was very well off.\n\nAt various parts, your father sort of like swoops down\n\nwith like legal help, and you get in trouble at Harvard,\n\nand he flies out across the country.\n\nAnd it seems that, just at other times,\n\nteachers would come in, even though you were\n\ninside your own head, people had your back at every turn.\n\nOh, there were teachers who put such a high percentage\n\nof their time into me versus the other students.\n\nI was so lucky in those things.\n\nAnd the one funny thing is my parents were well off,\n\nbut compared to the kids at this private school I was at,\n\nI was below average.\n\nI mean, they had bigger houses and they had wealth.\n\nMy dad was well paid to be a lawyer,\n\nbut we weren't a family that had wealth.\n\nSo I managed to both have the benefit\n\nof being at that school and actually have a little bit\n\nof a chip on my shoulder that, hey,\n\nyou guys are so much better off,\n\nyour parents gave you a car,\n\nand you didn't have to work in the summer.\n\nBut yes, you could hardly design a better childhood,\n\nincluding a timesharing computer terminal showing up\n\nwhen I'm 13 years old, and the high school scheduling,\n\nwhich is a super interesting algorithmic problem where,\n\nbecause I was good at math, they asked me to solve it.\n\nYeah, you did this unbelievable scheduling thing\n\nfor your school. Right.\n\nAnd the first time they asked me, I say,\n\nNo, I don't know how to do that.\n\nAnd then six months later when, tragically,\n\nthe people who are working on it are in a plane crash,\n\nI've actually figured out how to do it.\n\nSo the first serious algorithm was actually deciding\n\nwhen the classes would meet,\n\nand who would be in which classes,\n\nwhich is a very kind of cool problem.\n\nAnd so then to have that,\n\nthen to have TRW have this incredible project\n\nthat was very state of the art,\n\nin terms of real time reliability,\n\nand to have the great programmers there, including Norton,\n\nembrace me and say, Yeah, you think you're good,\n\nbut this code is not very good.\n\nRight, this was like a mentor you had\n\nwhen you were working on this project for TRW as a kid.\n\nRight, so I had like four times where I thought,\n\nhey, I'm pretty good at programming,\n\nand then I was either given a hard task or got feedback\n\nand I said, No, there's another level here.\n\nSo by the time I go to Harvard, I've had thousands of hours\n\nof complex programming experience.\n\nAnd then when I get there, I get to do even more.\n\nSo yes, the fact that parents encouraged me, as a male,\n\nthe idea of doing all, being weird like this was,\n\neh, it was kind of okay.\n\nThe school I went to,\n\nand that high school is a fantastic high school.\n\nI had at least five or six teachers\n\nwho kind of saw a spark in me and really engaged with me.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, in his book about outliers,\n\nsays that the ingredients are like 10,000 hours,\n\ncertainly you've topped that by a big number,\n\nin terms of programming,\n\n10,000 hours of practice doing something.\n\nI guess a degree of timeliness, which you just talked about.\n\nI still find that kind of unsatisfying.\n\nWhat makes Bill Gates, Bill Gates?\n\nWell certainly it's not just the circumstances,\n\nbut that's gigantic.\n\nI mean that eliminates people born at a different time,\n\nand many people\n\nwho didn't get the educational opportunities.\n\nYes, there's still a few million kids\n\nwho are in the same milieu that I am.\n\nAnd then it's okay, seeing my father,\n\nunderstanding the common sense of business,\n\nseeing a business like Physio Control that was up and down,\n\nthe early engagement with Digital Equipment Corporation,\n\nwhich to me was this vaunted company\n\nthat proved that it wasn't just mainframes,\n\nand those people embraced me.\n\nI mean, I got to know them in many phases,\n\nincluding once they offered me a job,\n\njust 'cause I wanted that reinforcement.\n\nSo yes, there's something about my desire to succeed,\n\nand my skillset, being forward looking,\n\nwhich my friend Kent Evans, who's in the book,\n\nhelped really cement that.\n\nKent helped shape me as forward looking, amazing person.\n\nAnd then Paul's more off reading about the chip stuff.\n\nI didn't read Electronics magazine.\n\nWell after Paul showed me it, okay, then I did.\n\nBut that's Paul, and it's actually pretty unnatural,\n\n'cause he's two years ahead of me,\n\nthe fact that he seeks me out and says,\n\nBill, what does exponential improvement mean?\n\nAnd I say, Are you kidding?\n\nThat is mine.\n\nExponential improvement is a very, very special thing\n\nthat doesn't happen except in rare, rare, rare cases.\n\nPaul also clued you on to LSD,\n\nwhich you talk about taking a couple times.\n\nSteve Jobs would always say\n\nthat was like the formative experience\n\nand helped open up the gates of design in his mind.\n\nI don't get that impression that you felt that\n\nto be a life-changing experience.\n\nI think the batch that he got\n\nmust have really been good [Steven laughs]\n\nfor product design and marketing.\n\nI mean, my god, just think if I'd had that batch.\n\nYeah, I did some crazy things when I was young,\n\nand Paul deserved some credit for that.\n\nBut yeah, we did that together a few times.\n\nEventually we gave it up.\n\nBy the time we get serious about work,\n\nwe're not doing that anymore.\n\nYou also mentioned the famous time you got busted\n\nfor speeding and spent the night in jail.\n\nI was hoping to learn more about that.\n\nDid that freak you out, spending a night in jail?\n\nNo, it was just kind of a funny thing.\n\nI mean, they thought it was strange to have somebody\n\nso young that had a nice car.\n\nYou had a Porsche.\n\nWhat was the story with this kid?\n\nWas I a drug dealer or something?\n\nI clearly didn't fit their normal pattern.\n\nWe kept enough cash around\n\nthat Paul was able to come down and bail me out,\n\nbut took him a few hours to get it together.\n\nSo yeah, there's that, a famous mugshot of me in Albuquerque\n\nbecause I got pulled over and didn't have my license.\n\nIn the end of the book,\n\nyou say that sometimes you look back\n\nand wish you were back again\n\nwhere you were when you were 13 years old,\n\nand just like learning about everything.\n\nAnd you describe yourself, at that time,\n\nas someone who just lived largely inside your head.\n\nTalk about that. Are you?\n\nWith all your success, and all the access to the world,\n\nreally, that you have, you look back,\n\nand wanna roll the tape back?\n\nWell, I've been so lucky\n\nthat I'm not saying I want to go back and change something.\n\nBut it was kind of amazing to live through that,\n\nhey, I'm just this kid and all of us are the same,\n\nto okay, here's something I'm curious about,\n\nhere's some people to do it with me.\n\nHaving a dream, a computer on every desk in every home,\n\nthe importance of software,\n\nto actually have it come completely true\n\nand get to work with, in this phase of my life,\n\nwith Kent, and with Paul,\n\nand I'm just meeting Steve Ballmer at Harvard,\n\nbut he hasn't come to help.\n\nI'm sure we'll hear a lot about that.\n\nThat'll be right at the start of the Microsoft book.\n\nWe're up in Seattle and I decide,\n\nboy, I can't run this thing myself.\n\nI need my friend who really gets business,\n\nand management, and people, and so he comes in.\n\nSo it was so magical and so incredible\n\nthat I do kind of miss that wonderful thing\n\nwhere the whole thing was in doubt.\n\nThere were days when I thought, oh, we are so messed up,\n\nand other people are ahead of us,\n\nand who do we think we are to have these wild dreams,\n\nand yet, step by step,\n\nwe build this incredible group of people.\n\n[photos clicking]\n\nYou know, it's interesting, the book, again,\n\nis a coming-of-age story.\n\nBut you talk about, you look back\n\nand say how much we are shaped by who we are,\n\nand we are like who we are.\n\nYou talk about saying, boy,\n\nI think somewhat remorsefully saying,\n\nI was like a smart aleck in school\n\nand that wasn't a smart thing to do.\n\nAnd you talk about being, pushing back about everyone.\n\nAnd it made me think really the way you behaved\n\nin your deposition, being a smart aleck there.\n\nAh, you think I was a smart aleck, that lawyer,\n\nnow that's a smart aleck. [Steven laughs]\n\nNot recalling the specifics of the interview is\n\nthat it's very unlikely I would make a statement like that\n\nwithout some common understanding between myself\n\nand the reporter of what that term,\n\nwhich, out of context, is incredibly ambiguous,\n\nwhat it meant in the context of her series of questions.\n\n[Lawyer] And just to be sure I understand it,\n\nwhat you're saying is that you don't remember\n\nwhat the definition was,\n\nand you don't even remember that there was a definition,\n\nbut you believe there must have been a definition\n\nor you wouldn't have been using these words.\n\nIs that fair?\n\nThere must have been a common understanding,\n\nI wouldn't say a definition.\n\nThere's a certain clever boy shortcut use of sarcasm\n\nthat allows you to communicate efficiently.\n\nIt can be kind of funny.\n\nAnd yes, that whole kind of sparring,\n\nthat sitting at night at Harvard, talking to each other,\n\nthat kind of dialogue doesn't work\n\nwhen you're managing people.\n\nOr even my skill of procrastination, which at Harvard,\n\nthat was my personal position was,\n\nah, I don't work in these classes 'til late.\n\nSo yeah, there's a lot of habits of being a young,\n\ntrying to be a cool, maybe not succeeding,\n\nbut trying to be a cool student,\n\nthat I actually had to break those habits,\n\nprocrastination, being super clever and kind of sarcastic,\n\ntearing somebody's argument apart.\n\nI mean, yes, the underlying skill is actually worthwhile,\n\nbut knowing not to deploy it as the kind of go-to approach,\n\nwhich when I was a student was kind of my whole way\n\nof engaging with other people.\n\nWe have the one anecdote in there\n\nwhere I told this professor how wrong he was,\n\nand I was just so certain of myself.\n\nAnd you were wrong.\n\nAnd then five minutes after I attack him,\n\nI realized, oh god,\n\nthere's a reason why it actually comes back.\n\nAnd his thing was completely right\n\nand I was completely wrong.\n\nThat was a helpful experience\n\nbecause the guy was so nice about it,\n\nand I was so outta line.\n\nOne final question, do people really change?\n\nNo, I think you moderate,\n\nand you become wiser, and you grow.\n\nBut the idea of, am I still pretty much\n\nthat same kind of hyperactive, curious,\n\nmaybe I can figure this out\n\nthat other people can't figure out.\n\nAnd if I do figure it out, what am I gonna do about it?\n\nWho do I work with on this?\n\nI'm still 95% that same person.\n\nBill, thanks so much for doing The Big Interview.\n\nThank you.

                "text": "Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old engineer with Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) known as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d is now on staff at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, WIRED has confirmed. He is joined by another member of the DOGE team, 38-year-old software engineer Kyle Schutt, who is now also on the CISA staff, according to a government source.\n\nCISA referred WIRED to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), of which it\u2019s a component agency, when reached for comment. DHS did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nCoristine\u2014briefly an intern for Musk\u2019s brain-computer interface company Neuralink, as WIRED has reported\u2014has been working his way through numerous federal agencies and departments as a DOGE operative since January. He has been tracked at the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management, the State Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. At State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Technology, he potentially had access to systems containing sensitive information about diplomats and many sources around the world who provide the US government with intelligence and expertise.\n\nAs the journalist Marisa Kabas was first to report, he has now moved to CISA, a division of DHS. He is listed in the staff directory as a senior adviser.\n\nA second DOGE worker, Schutt, has also joined Coristine at CISA. Schutt has reportedly also been at the GSA. Prior to his work with DOGE, he worked on the launch of WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republicans that helped the party raise $1.8 billion during the 2024 election campaigns.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what level of access Coristine might have to data and networks at CISA, but the agency, which is responsible for the defense of civilian federal government networks and works closely with critical infrastructure owners around the country, stores a lot of sensitive and critical security information on its networks. This includes information about software vulnerabilities, breaches, and network risk assessments conducted for local and state election offices. Since 2018, CISA has helped state and local election offices around the country assess vulnerabilities in their networks and help secure them. CISA also works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency to notify victims of breaches and process information about software vulnerabilities before the information becomes public.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Kimz.42.\n\nCoristine, as WIRED has previously reported, worked briefly in 2022 for Path Network, a network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers. According to security journalist Brian Krebs, an account once associated with him was also previously linked with a loosely formed cybercriminal community known as The Com, whose members have been responsible for various hacking operations in the last few years, including the hack of numerous Snowflake accounts. Coristine has not been associated with the Snowflake breaches, but as WIRED has reported, an account that has been associated with him did appear to suggest the owner of the account was seeking help to conduct a distributed denial-of-service attack\u2014a criminal technique that involves launching extensive traffic at a domain to disable it and prevent legitimate traffic from reaching it. Krebs also reported that Path had fired Coristine for allegedly leaking internal company documents to a competitor.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Coristine had been assigned to the DHS as a senior adviser but didn\u2019t indicate what part of the sprawling agency he had joined.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of fighting cybercrime if we\u2019re just going to give access for government networks to people with cybercriminal gang affiliations?\u201d says a cybersecurity researcher who tracks cybercriminal groups.",

                "text": "Loneliness has never been more urgent. On top of the significant mental health concerns, the idea that people are now lonelier and having fewer social interactions is fueling very real threats to security. Foremost among these is one of today\u2019s most pernicious digital frauds: romance scams, which exploit targets\u2019 feelings of isolation and net fraudsters hundreds of millions of dollars per year. As scammers increasingly organize their workflows and incorporate new AI technologies, it\u2019s becoming possible for them to deploy these scams at an even more vast scale.\n\nRomance scams, also known as confidence scams, are extremely communication-intensive. They require attackers to build relationships with their targets via dating apps and social media. So while generative AI chatbots are already being used to write scripts and converse in multiple languages for other types of fraud, they can\u2019t quite pull off these romance scams on their own. But with the vulnerable population growing, researchers believe there is real potential for automation to provide a boon to scammers.\n\n\u201cThese frauds are growing into a more organized form,\u201d says Fangzhou Wang, an assistant professor researching cybercrime at the University of Texas at Arlington. \u201cThey are hiring individuals from all over the world, meaning that they can target all different kinds of victims. Everybody is using dating apps and social media. There are all these opportunities that give fraudsters fertile ground.\u201d\n\nRomance fraud is already big business for scammers. People in the US have reported losses of nearly $4.5 billion to romance and confidence fraud over the past decade, according to an analysis of the last 10 years of data from the FBI\u2019s annual internet crime reports. (The most recent data available encompasses up to the end of 2023.) According to the FBI\u2019s figures, romance and confidence scams have led to losses of around $600 million for each of the past five years\u2014except for 2021, when losses peaked at almost $1 billion. Some estimates are even higher. And while there has been some decrease in the amount of money lost to romance scammers in recent years, there has been a rise in so-called pig butchering fraud, which often contains elements of confidence scams.\n\nWIRED went looking for love and found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible.\n\nRomance scams begin all over the internet, from criminals blasting out messages on Facebook to hundreds of victims at a time, to others matching with every profile they see on dating apps. A variety of criminals run romance scams, from \u201cYahoo Boys\u201d in West Africa to giant scam compounds in Southeast Asia. However, once a criminal has made contact with a potential victim, they all follow an eerily similar playbook to build emotional attachment with those they are attempting to defraud.\n\n\u201cRomance fraud is the most devastating fraud to be a victim of, bar none,\u201d says Elisabeth Carter, an associate professor of criminology at Kingston University London, who has extensively studied these scams and their impacts on people.\n\nOnline dating has taken years to integrate into mainstream conceptions of relationships and love, but it is now the norm. As generative AI chatbots have found their way onto scores of smartphones, they have quickly become yet another digital avenue for romance and connection. While it would be difficult with current technology to farm out a romance scam to a chatbot entirely, the potential is clearly there for attackers to use generative AI for creating scam scripts and helping fill in content for more and more chats that are all running simultaneously, even in multiple languages.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ravaged its way though the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), cutting its workforce from 10,000 to just 300, hundreds of organizations providing vital safety services have been upended. Multiple children\u2019s safety groups\u2014including those fighting online child sexual abuse and exploitation\u2014say their efforts have been severely hamstrung.\n\nGroups identifying victims and providing care for those who have been subject to online exploitation or human trafficking are struggling to support the vulnerable children, multiple organizations tell WIRED. Such child safety projects often take place in poorer countries, which can have fewer resources to support victims or investigate crimes. Sources say that funding for safe houses has been paused, potentially exposing victims to more harm, and efforts that identify criminals behind child exploitation have been put on hold.\n\n\u201cIt will be very hard for us to identify the victims,\u201d says Chantal Yelu Mulop, from the Coordination for Youth and the Fight Against Sexual Violence and Trafficking in Persons (CJVFFT), in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the war-torn country faces new fighting and humanitarian crises, children have long been trafficked to work in cobalt mines linked to the production of smartphone and EV batteries.\n\nAs USAID funding was withdrawn over the past week, Mulop says her organization had just started helping around 25 newly identified victims of human trafficking\u2014all of them aged under 17. The group was taken to a support shelter run by another organization. \u201cWhen we bring them there, USAID was ready to help. A few hours later they cancel,\u201d Mulop says. \u201cThere\u2019s no food, no nothing that we can provide to them,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhile the USAID cuts have been immediate, global child protection projects have also faced a funding pause from the State Department. This foreign aid \u201cpause,\u201d issued by the Trump administration, is set to last for at least 90 days. USAID did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment. The State Department had not provided a comment by time of publication.\n\nBoth government bodies have provided funding to help countries and people around the world. This includes USAID\u2019s vast swath of health care and education programs\u2014their withdrawal is putting millions of lives at risk and limits tackling the climate crisis. In Southeast Asia, several patients at a migrant camp reportedly died after medical support was removed.\n\nCounter-human-trafficking funding often includes money for projects that help to crack down on online child exploitation and sexual abuse. Funding can be provided to international organizations that coordinate efforts and work with partners, like Mulop\u2019s CJVFFT, on the ground. The funding can directly support victims, as well as providing expertise to officials in countries, and stop more children becoming targets.\n\n\u201cMany of these victims engage with their traffickers through electronic means,\u201d says Jessica Ryckman, the executive director of the nonprofit Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB), which works on trafficking and child exploitation programs and has been impacted by the funding changes. \u201cIt is exploitation that is advanced through digital technology.\u201d",

                "text": "It was the most expensive war game in US military history, and the outcome was a disaster.\n\nConducted in 2002 and costing roughly $250 million to plan over two years, the so-called Millennium Challenge exercise pitted a Blue team representing the United States against a Red team representing a fictional state in the Persian Gulf, usually understood as Iran or Iraq, as a means of testing the US Defense Department\u2019s post-Cold War doctrine based on advanced new technologies and concepts.\n\nDespite the Blue Team\u2019s ostensible military and technological superiority, the Red team, led by Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul Van Riper, unleashed complete chaos upon its adversary using unanticipated asymmetric and unconventional tactics\u2014most notably, a complex cruise missile attack followed by a wave of explosive-laden kamikaze speedboats that, in one 10-minute swarm, sank 19 Blue team warships and inflicted 20,000 simulated casualties on his adversary. The exercise was so disastrous that the Pentagon went on to impose arbitrary constraints on the Red team that all but ensured a Blue team victory, prompting Van Riper to quit as team leader in protest.\n\nAs part of its complicated legacy, Millennium Challenge 2002 had undermined the very advanced technologies it sought to validate, proving that a handful of small watercraft could, when deployed in coordinated swarms amid a larger attack, successfully outmaneuver larger surface warships with potentially deadly consequences. It\u2019s a lesson the Pentagon all but ignored by stacking the deck in favor of the Blue team following the Red team\u2019s initial victory. Now, more than two decades later, its lessons are playing out in battlefields around the world.\n\nView of an explosion on a ship that Houthis say is an attack by them on Greek-owned MV Tutor in the Red Sea, dated June 12, 2024, in this screen grab obtained from a video. Photograph: HOUTHI MEDIA CENTRE/Reuters\n\nUnmanned surface vessels (USVs) loaded with explosives and other lethal payloads are proving a fearsome weapon for ostensibly outgunned fighting forces. Amid Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion, the Ukrainian military has successfully driven Moscow\u2019s Black Sea Fleet from its safe harbor in Sevastopol in the annexed Crimean peninsula using a growing fleet of weaponized drone boats that aren\u2019t just successfully targeting other surface vessels, but engaging shore targets with their own organic kamikaze first-person-view drones and knocking Russian aircraft out of the sky with machine guns and surface-to-air missiles. In the Red Sea, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have employed explosive-laden watercraft to lesser effect in response to Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, successfully sinking the Liberia-flagged bulk carrier MV Tutor in June 2024 and consistently disrupting international maritime traffic in the region.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampage through United States federal institutions, WIRED reported extensively this week on DOGE\u2019s members, activity, and digital access to some of the US government's most delicate and critical software systems. One DOGE technologist, 19-year-old high school graduate Edward Coristine, established at least five different companies in the past four years\u2014including Tesla.Sexy LLC\u2014and briefly worked at a network monitoring company that has hired convicted hackers. Experts question whether Coristine, who has gone by the name \u201cBig Balls\u201d online, would pass the background check typically required for access to sensitive US government systems.\n\nMeanwhile, DOGE\u2019s apparent dismantling of USAID coupled with the US State Department's funding freeze have dramatically disrupted efforts to help people escape forced labor camps in Southeast Asia run by criminal scammers.\n\nOutside of US government news, WIRED conducted an investigation into more than 300 cyberattacks in the past five years against US K\u201312 schools and found that victim schools sometimes withhold critical information about the scale and scope of the breaches from impacted students and parents. In slightly better news, data from the cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis shows that ransomware payments fell precipitously in the second half of 2024. Experts fear, though, that the brief reprieve could be short-lived and may not be easy for defenders to sustain.\n\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that Apple has received a secret order from the UK office of the Home Secretary mandating the company to provide a way to access any user data protected by the company\u2019s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. The feature, which debuted at the end of 2022, is designed with end-to-end encryption so only users themselves, not Apple, have access to their data. As a result, complying with the UK demand would require Apple to break the feature by building a backdoor into it. Sources told the Post that rather than install a backdoor, Apple is likely to withdraw support for Advanced Data Protection for iCloud in the UK. \u201cYet that concession would not fulfill the UK demand for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States,\u201d the Post noted.\n\nThe order was issued under the UK\u2019s broad 2016 Investigatory Powers Act. UK law enforcement agencies, not to mention cops in the US and other countries, have championed encryption backdoors for years, and lawmakers have tried at various times to mandate backdoors. The Home Office told the Post in a statement, \u201cWe do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\u201d An Apple spokesperson declined to comment to the Post.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave President Donald Trump a golden pager when the two met in Washington on Tuesday. The gift references a September attack in Lebanon against the militant group Hezbollah in which booby-trapped pagers (and walkie-talkies) detonated in coordinated explosions around the country. The operation killed at least 42 people, including some civilians, and injured at least 4,000 civilians, according to Lebanese officials. The attack has been widely attributed to Israel, but the country has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. At the meeting Trump apparently gave Netanyahu a signed photograph of the two of them, which he signed, \u201cTo Bibi, a great leader!\u201d\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has been notifying dozens of users that their personal information was stolen during a 2023 breach. The company is attributing the attack to Russian state-backed hackers. The stolen data included Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license information, and credit card numbers. The incident began as a system intrusion in May 2023 into HPE\u2019s email mailboxes and Microsoft SharePoint systems. HPE publicly disclosed the incident in January 2024.\n\nThe edtech giant PowerSchool says that at least 16,000 students in the United Kingdom had their data stolen as part of a massive December data breach that may have affected 62 million students and 9.5 million teachers, most of them in the US and Canada. Attackers used compromised credentials to infiltrate the company\u2019s customer support portal and then access user data.\n\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement that students at four UK schools were affected totaling \u201capproximately 16,000 students.\u201d It is not clear if this is the total number of UK victims. The compromised data includes students\u2019 dates of birth, contact information, some medical data, and \u201cother related information.\u201d",

                "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) told federal lawmakers on Friday that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have seized control of a number of federal computer systems that house data tightly restricted under federal statutes. In some cases, any deviations in the manner in which the data is being used may be not only illegal, the ACLU says, but unconstitutional.\n\nDOGE operatives have infiltrated or assumed control of a number of federal agencies that are responsible for managing personnel files on nearly 2 million federal employees, as well as offices that supply the government with a broad range of software and information technology services.\n\nUnauthorized use of sensitive or personally identifiable data as part of an effort to purge the government of ideologically unaligned staff may constitute a violation of federal law. The Privacy Act and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act strictly prohibit, for instance, unauthorized access and use of government personnel data.\n\nIn a letter to members of several congressional oversight committees, ACLU attorneys highlighted DOGE\u2019s access to Treasury systems that handle a \u201cmajority\u201d of federal payments, which includes details on Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and salaries. Citing WIRED reporting from Tuesday, the attorneys note that, in addition to choking off funding to specific agencies or individuals, this grants DOGE access to \u201ctroves of personal information,\u201d including \u201cmillions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances, and personal finances.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys write: \u201cAccess to\u2014and abuse of\u2014that information could harm millions of people. Young engineers, with no experience in human resources, governmental benefits, or legal requirements around privacy have gained unprecedented surveillance over payments to federal employees, Social Security recipients, and small businesses\u2014and with it, control over those payments.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU attorneys stress that, under normal circumstances, these systems would fall under the control of career civil servants with years of training and experience in managing sensitive data, all of whom survived a comprehensive vetting process.\n\nThe group has also filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for the communications records of identified DOGE personnel, as well as for details of any requests the task force may have made for access to sensitive and personal data at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\n\nOther files the ACLU seeks pertain to DOGE\u2019s plans to deploy artificial intelligence tools across the government, as well as any plans or discussions about how the task force plans to conform to the litany of federal laws safeguarding sensitive financial and medical information, such as the the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nWIRED first reported Thursday that DOGE operatives at the General Services Administration, which manages the US government\u2019s IT infrastructure, had begun pushing to rapidly deploy a homebrew AI chatbot called \u201cGSAi.\u201d A source with knowledge of GSA's prior dealings with AI tells WIRED that the agency launched a pilot program last fall aimed at testing the use of Gemini, a chatbot adapted for Google Workplace. DOGE quickly determined, however, that Gemini would not provide the level of data desired by the task force.",

                "text": "A young technologist known online as \u201cBig Balls,\u201d who works for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has access to sensitive US government systems. But his professional and online history call into question whether he would pass the background check typically required to obtain security clearances, security experts tell WIRED.\n\nEdward Coristine, a 19-year-old high school graduate, established at least five different companies in the last four years, with entities registered in Connecticut, Delaware, and the United Kingdom, most of which were not listed on his now-deleted LinkedIn profile. Coristine also briefly worked in 2022 at Path Network, a network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers. Someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine also solicited a cyberattack-for-hire service later that year.\n\nCoristine did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nOne of the companies Coristine founded, Tesla.Sexy LLC, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old. Coristine is listed as the founder and CEO of the company, according to business records reviewed by WIRED.\n\nTesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains. One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.\n\n\"Foreign connections, whether it's foreign contacts with friends or domain names registered in foreign countries, would be flagged by any agency during the security investigation process,\" Joseph Shelzi, a former US Army intelligence officer who held security clearance for a decade and managed the security clearance of other units under his command, tells WIRED.\n\nA longtime former US intelligence analyst, who requested anonymity to speak on sensitive topics, agrees. \u201cThere's little chance that he could have passed a background check for privileged access to government systems,\u201d they allege.\n\nAnother domain under Coristine\u2019s control is faster.pw. The website is currently inactive, but an archived version from October 25, 2022 shows content in Chinese that stated the service helped provide \u201cmultiple encrypted cross-border networks.\u201d\n\nPrior to joining DOGE, Coristine worked for several months of 2024 at Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink brain implant startup, and, as WIRED previously reported, is now listed in Office of Personnel Management records as an \u201cexpert\u201d at that agency, which oversees personnel matters for the federal government. Employees of the General Services Administration say he also joined calls where they were made to justify their jobs and to review code they\u2019ve written.\n\nOther elements of Coristine\u2019s personal record reviewed by WIRED, government security experts say, would also raise questions about obtaining security clearances necessary to access privileged government data. These same experts further wonder about the vetting process for DOGE staff\u2014and, given Coristine\u2019s history, whether he underwent any such background check.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about what level of clearance, if any, Corisitine has and, if so, how it was granted.",

                "text": "As Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team continues to rampage through United States federal agencies, Trump administration efforts to eliminate the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) seem to be furthest along. The impacts of the agency\u2019s dismantling on humanitarian relief, public health, and human rights work, combined with the wider 90-day State Department pause on foreign aid payments, are already far-reaching and severe around the world. Sources tell WIRED that the situation is also impacting anti-human-trafficking work targeted at addressing forced labor compounds that fuel digital fraud like investment scams.\n\nThe funding cuts and pauses have immediately made it harder for people to safely escape scam compounds, according to half a dozen sources working to combat scams and trafficking. The cuts have also shrunk services that house and care for human trafficking victims and are limiting investigatory work into criminal groups. After just days of funding disruptions, sources say that the cuts have caused \u201cchaos\u201d for staff working to help survivors on a daily basis. Some organizations have already gone dark, and relief workers add that the withdrawal of services could embolden the criminal groups behind the fraud.\n\n\u201cIt is a really, really bad situation,\u201d says one person working in the anti-scam sector in Southeast Asia. The individual, as with several sources in this story, requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the work and ongoing changing situation. They say small grassroots organizations, which may have only a handful of staff each but help identify and work with trafficking victims, have been widely affected. \u201cThis pause will mean that organizations that essentially shifted their work from different forms of trafficking to looking at scamming compounds will cease to exist,\u201d they say.\n\nUSAID and the US State Department did not immediately respond to questions from WIRED about the situation.\n\nGot a tip?\n\nAre you a current or former USAID or State Department employee or a worker familiar with anti-human-trafficking efforts? We\u2019d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Matt Burgess securely on Signal at mattburgess.20 and Lily Hay Newman at +1 (347) 722-1347.\n\nOver the past five years, dozens of \u201cscam compounds\u201d have been constructed in Southeast Asia, particularly within Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. Run by organized crime groups, which often have links to Chinese nationals, more than 200,000 people from 100-plus countries have been trafficked into the compounds\u2014often under the pretense of getting a legitimate job. These people are often held captive, beaten and tortured, and forced to work long shifts running online scams targeting people around the world, including in the United States. While the compounds engage in a range of fraudulent activity, so-called pig butchering scams have been the predominant focus, with global losses estimated at $75 billion or more.\n\nLaw enforcement efforts in Southeast Asia to tackle scam compounds and the criminal organizations heavily profiting from them have sometimes made progress, but have also been widely criticized for corruption and failing to comprehensively deal with the problem. However, a patchwork of NGOs, charities, and anti-trafficking organizations have been attempting to fill the gaps, helping victims escape and get access to legal advice, health care, and other resources. A US State Department webpage details more than $272 million in funding provided to fight human trafficking around the world, with Southeast Asia programs that include investigative efforts, survivor protection, and more. And USAID directly funds humanitarian groups in the region.\n\nJulia Macher, the CEO of Freedom Collaborative, a network that has been impacted by the freezes and works with grassroots groups fighting scam compounds, says the repercussions of the drastic changes at USAID have been \u201cinstantaneous.\u201d",

                "text": "For much of the past year, the trail of destruction and mayhem left behind by ransomware hackers was on full display. Digital extortion gangs paralyzed hundreds of US pharmacies and clinics through their attack on Change Healthcare, exploited security vulnerabilities in the customer accounts of cloud provider Snowflake to breach a string of high-profile targets, and extracted a record $75 million from a single victim.\n\nYet beneath those headlines, the numbers tell a surprising story: Ransomware payments actually fell overall in 2024\u2014and in the second half of the year dropped more precipitously than in any six-month period on record.\n\nCryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis today released a portion of its annual crime report focused on tracking the ransomware industry, which found that ransomware victims\u2019 extortion payments totaled $814 million in 2024, a drop of 35 percent compared to the record $1.25 billion that hackers extracted from ransomware victims the previous year. Breaking down the payments over the course of 2024 shows an even more positive trend: Hackers collected just $321 million from July through December compared to $492 million the previous half year, the biggest falloff in payments between two six-month periods that Chainalysis has ever seen.\n\n\u201cThe drastic reversal of the trends we were seeing in the first half of the year to the second was quite surprising,\u201d says Jackie Burns Koven, who leads cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis. She suggests that dropoff is likely due to law enforcement takedowns and disruptions, some of which had delayed effects that weren't immediately apparent in the first half of the year as ransomware victims and the cybersecurity industry grappled with catastrophic attacks.\n\n\u201cDon't get me wrong: For everyone who's a defender or an incident responder, it's been a year,\" Burns Koven says. \u201cBut it is noteworthy that for the major attacks that occurred last year, those groups don't exist anymore or have been laying low. There's been a strong signal from law enforcement that if you cross the line, there's going to be consequences.\u201d\n\nUS and UK law enforcement scored two significant disruptions of major ransomware groups around the beginning of 2024: Six days before Christmas of 2023, the FBI announced that it had found vulnerabilities in the encryption software used by the group known as BlackCat or AlphV, distributed decryption keys to victims to foil the group\u2019s extortion tactics, and taken down the dark-web sites the group had used to issue its threats. Two months later, in February of 2024, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency carried out an operation against the notorious ransomware group Lockbit, hijacking its infrastructure, seizing its cryptocurrency wallets, taking down its dark-web sites, and even obtaining information about its members and cybercriminal partners.\n\nInitially, however, both groups seemed to bounce back from those busts. AlphV in February announced that it had hacked Change Healthcare, disabling payments at hundreds of US clinics and pharmacies and extracting $22 million from the United Healthcare\u2013owned company in one of the worst health-care-related ransomware incidents in history. Lockbit, too, seemed to shake off the NCA\u2019s blows, immediately launching a new dark-web site where it continued to extort victims old and new.",

                "text": "Schools have faced an onslaught of cyberattacks since the pandemic disrupted education nationwide five years ago, yet district leaders across the country have employed a pervasive pattern of obfuscation that leaves the real victims in the dark, an investigation by The 74 shows.\n\nAn in-depth analysis chronicling more than 300 school cyberattacks over the past five years reveals the degree to which school leaders in virtually every state repeatedly provide false assurances to students, parents, and staff about the security of their sensitive information. At the same time, consultants and lawyers steer \u201cprivileged investigations\u201d that keep key details hidden from the public.\n\nThis article was copublished with The 74, a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here.\n\nIn more than two dozen cases, educators were forced to backtrack months\u2014and in some cases more than a year\u2014later after telling their communities that sensitive information, which included, in part, special education accommodations, mental health challenges, and student sexual misconduct reports, had not been exposed. While many school officials offered evasive storylines, others refused to acknowledge basic details about cyberattacks and their effects on individuals, even after the hackers made student and teacher information public.\n\nThe hollowness in schools\u2019 messaging is no coincidence.\n\nThat\u2019s because the first people alerted following a school cyberattack are generally not the public nor the police. District incident response plans place insurance companies and their phalanxes of privacy lawyers first. They take over the response, with a focus on limiting schools\u2019 exposure to lawsuits by aggrieved parents or employees.\n\nThe attorneys, often employed by just a handful of law firms\u2014dubbed breach mills by one law professor for their massive caseloads\u2014hire the forensic cyber analysts, crisis communicators, and ransom negotiators on behalf of the schools, placing the discussions under the shield of attorney-client privilege. Data privacy compliance is a growth industry for these specialized lawyers, who work to control the narrative.\n\nThe result: Students, families, and district employees whose personal data was published online\u2014from their financial and medical information to traumatic events in young people\u2019s lives\u2014are left clueless about their exposure and risks to identity theft, fraud, and other forms of online exploitation. Told sooner, they could have taken steps to protect themselves.\n\nSimilarly, the public is often unaware when school officials quietly agree in closed-door meetings to pay the cybergangs\u2019 ransom demands in order to recover their files and unlock their computer systems. Research suggests that the surge in incidents has been fueled, at least in part, by insurers\u2019 willingness to pay. Hackers themselves have stated that when a target carries cyber insurance, ransom payments are \u201call but guaranteed.\u201d\n\nIn 2023, there were 121 ransomware attacks on US K-12 schools and colleges, according to Comparitech, a consumer-focused cybersecurity website whose researchers acknowledge that number is an undercount. An analysis by the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes reported 265 ransomware attacks against the education sector globally in 2023\u2014a 70 percent year-over-year surge, making it \u201cthe worst ransomware year on record for education.\u201d\n\nDaniel Schwarcz, a University of Minnesota law professor, wrote a 2023 report for the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology criticizing the confidentiality and doublespeak that shroud school cyberattacks as soon as the lawyers\u2014often called breach coaches\u2014arrive on the scene.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between misleading and, you know, technically accurate,\u201d Schwarcz told The 74. \u201cWhat breach coaches try to do is push right up to that line\u2014and sometimes they cross it.\u201d\n\nWhen Breaches Go Unspoken\n\nThe 74\u2019s investigation into the behind-the-scenes decisionmaking that determines what, when, and how school districts reveal cyberattacks is based on thousands of documents obtained through public records requests from more than two dozen districts and school spending data that links to the law firms, ransomware negotiators, and other consultants hired to run district responses. It also includes an analysis of millions of stolen school district records uploaded to cybergangs\u2019 leak sites.\n\nSome of students\u2019 most sensitive information lives indefinitely on the dark web, a hidden part of the internet that\u2019s often used for anonymous communication and illicit activities. Other personal data can be found online with little more than a Google search\u2014even as school districts deny that their records were stolen and cyberthieves boast about their latest score.",

real consequences here in the US,\n\nyou could see pipelines being affected,\n\nwater being affected, telecommunications being severed.\n\nWired sat down with outgoing CISA Director Jen Easterly\n\nto talk about her time in Washington\n\nand the future of US cybersecurity,\n\nthis is the big interview.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHi Jen, I'm so happy to be here with you.\n\nYou're in your last days as the director of CISA.\n\nHow are your last days feeling?\n\nWell, it's bittersweet, of course.\n\nThis has been the best job I've ever had and the best team\n\nand every day it's been a privilege to come into work here,\n\nso it's a little bittersweet to be leaving,\n\nbut I feel really, really good about\n\neverything that we've been able to do.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of unfinished business,\n\nbut I think we have set a good path for the incoming team.\n\nI know my team is excited to continue\n\nto drive forward on the many priorities that we've set,\n\nbut all good things come to an end\n\nand looking forward to next adventures.\n\nAnd you've been here three and a half years, right?\n\nYeah, I came in, I was nominated in April,\n\nconfirmed in July, so over three and a half years.\n\nAnd then I was actually part of the transition team,\n\nI was the Cyber Policy Lead\n\nwhen I was still at Morgan Stanley.\n\nSo was working these issues early on\n\nand in fact, when I was the cyber policy lead,\n\nit was during the SolarWinds.\n\nSo that was a very interesting incident to observe,\n\nboth from being in the private sector,\n\nbut also being part of the transition team to see\n\nhow far we could come and frankly how far we have come\n\nwith respect to being able to secure the.gov,\n\nthe federal civilian executive branch.\n\nAnd so that was a useful sort of marker for me.\n\nThat must have been a really interesting vantage point\n\nand a good learning experience.\n\nI didn't realize that that was exactly the timing\n\nof when you came in because you know,\n\none thing we're gonna talk a lot about you and your tenure,\n\nbut one thing I wanted to bring up that I'm sure\n\nit's top of mind for everyone,\n\nand I'm sure it's something you've been engaged with,\n\nis revelations recently about Chinese espionage\n\nand hacking in US telecoms.\n\nSo I'm interested to know what you observed\n\nin that other situation,\n\nwhich was obviously Russian hackers, different situation,\n\nbut how were the lessons learned there then applicable\n\nwith the work you all are doing now in this response?\n\nWell, certainly what we saw in December of 2020\n\nwith the revelations about the intrusions\n\ninto federal government networks\n\nas well as businesses around the world,\n\nwas a pretty sophisticated supply chain espionage operation.\n\nAnd off the back of that, there were a lot of things\n\nthat were put in place in 2021\n\nto include through the executive order 14028,\n\nwhere a lot of the responsibilities came to CISA,\n\nthere was also some money that came to CISA\n\nthrough the American Rescue Plan Act,\n\nand I would say the bumper sticker\n\nwas to finally allow CISA\n\nin our role as America's Cyber Defense Agency\n\nand as the national coordinator\n\nfor critical infrastructure resilience and security\n\nto manage the .gov as an enterprise,\n\nnot as a disparate tribe\n\nof a hundred separate departments and agencies.\n\nSo what we've been able to put in place\n\nacross the so-called fseb, the.gov,\n\nover the past three and a half years,\n\nhas given us enormous visibility that we never had before\n\nand has allowed us to detect intrusions much more rapidly\n\nto be able to remediate them\n\nand to get ahead of future intrusions\n\nby understanding from an analytic perspective\n\nwhat exactly is happening on the .gov.\n\nAnd then frankly, using that information\n\nto be able to enrich our work with critical infrastructure\n\nbecause all of our networks are connected,\n\nthey're vulnerable in many ways.\n\nAnd so understanding and enriching what we know\n\nfrom what we see on the .gov\n\nto what we see in critical infrastructure has also been\n\na really important evolution.\n\nWith respect to China, as you know Lily,\n\nwe've been talking about this for years.\n\nThe big thing for me that changed\n\nbecause certainly I've been doing\n\ncyber for a very long time.\n\nWe were always very focused on the PRC\n\nwith respect to espionage campaigns and data theft\n\nand intellectual property theft.\n\nAnd we're certainly seeing that now\n\nwith this so-called salt typhoon campaign\n\nwith intrusions into our telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nBut the big thing for me was seeing\n\nintrusions into our critical infrastructure,\n\nnot for espionage,\n\nbut rather specifically for disruption and destruction.\n\nAnd we've talked a lot about that,\n\nI testified earlier this year,\n\nbut at the end of the day, this is really a world where\n\na major conflict in Asia,\n\nthe potential invasion or blockade of Taiwan by the PRC\n\ncould have very real consequences here in the US.\n\nYou could see pipelines being affected,\n\nwater being affected, telecommunications being severed,\n\nrail lines, power, exactly.\n\nAnd that is all part of a very deliberate effort\n\nby China to incite what they call societal panic\n\nand to deter our ability to marshal military might\n\nand citizen will.\n\nThis is all part of a very deliberate campaign\n\nand that's why we have been so laser focused,\n\nleveraging our technical talent at CISA\n\nto be able to work with the private sector to identify\n\nand eradicate these types of actors from their networks\n\nto provide mitigation and hunting,\n\nguidance, hardening guidance in\n\nwhat we just put out for telecommunications,\n\nguidance on how to communicate securely.\n\nYou saw that in some of our recent guidance\n\non end to end encryption,\n\nencrypted communications, which is really important.\n\nAnd then to work through mechanisms\n\nlike our joint cyber defense collaborative\n\nthat we stood up in August of 2021\n\nto work with a wide variety\n\nof those critical infrastructure sectors,\n\npower, telecommunications, aviation, transportation,\n\nto ensure that we have a common picture of the threat\n\nand that these entities know what they need to do\n\nto reduce risk.\n\nI think one of the most important things,\n\nand you and I have talked about this before,\n\nvis-a-vis Ukraine when we did a panel together\n\nwith Viktor Zhora of the Ukraine Cyber Defense Agency\n\nis really the importance of resilience.\n\nIt is gonna be extremely difficult\n\nto prevent disruption in a scalable way,\n\nand so we have to prepare for it.\n\nWe have to acknowledge that disruption may occur,\n\nbut the way that we train our people, how we exercise,\n\nhow we architect our systems needs to enable us to detect,\n\nrespond, and then recover\n\nso that we can mitigate the downtime\n\nfor critical infrastructure services\n\nthat are necessary for the American people.\n\nDo you think the espionage operations\n\nare getting too much focus and that actually,\n\nthere needs to be more focus\n\non this critical infrastructure infiltration?\n\nThat activity is tracked under this group volt typhoon.\n\nIs there maybe what folks are talking about\n\nin the public sphere is different than the focus\n\nat an agency like CISA or what's the balance there?\n\nYeah, I mean we are very focused overall\n\non PRC cyber actors,\n\nwhether they're the so-called salt typhoon\n\nfocused on espionage,\n\nwhether it's volt typhoon,\n\nfocused on disruption and destruction,\n\nwe are focused on working with our federal partners,\n\nwith our industry partners\n\nto be able to identify these actors and intrusions,\n\neradicate them and harden our networks.\n\nI think we should not get too down the rabbit hole.\n\nAnd is it salt, is it flax, is it volt?\n\nAt the end of the day, China, as we've seen in\n\nassessments from the intelligence community,\n\nis the most formidable, persistent cyber threat\n\nthat we are dealing with, that we will deal with.\n\nAnd it's why frankly very early on when I got here, Lily,\n\nI felt I needed to get what are the big ideas, right?\n\nYou're leading a federal agency,\n\na fairly new federal agency,\n\none that's been through a huge effort to organize it,\n\none that's just been after a pandemic,\n\na contentious election.\n\nSo what are the big ideas\n\nto build America's cyber defense agency?\n\nAnd that was all about how do we catalyze\n\nand mobilize collaboration,\n\ncollaboration with industry, with international partners,\n\nwith state and local partners.\n\nAnd to do it in a way that's not the old hack needs stale\n\npublic private partnerships where you go meet once a month\n\nand share secret level information,\n\nit's really ongoing, real time work together\n\nwith a recognition that if your critical infrastructure,\n\na threat to one is a threat to many,\n\ngiven the interdependence of networks.\n\nIt's also a recognition that the federal government\n\nhas to be responsive, has to be transparent,\n\nhas to add value.\n\nThat was very much informed by my time at Morgan Stanley.\n\nAnd that you really needed these scalable platforms.\n\nSo the collaboration piece,\n\nthe fact that big corporations\n\nneeded to recognize this threat\n\nas a existential business risk,\n\none that they needed to prepare for and really manage,\n\nnot as something that the IT folks deal with,\n\nbut manage as a matter of good governance.\n\nSo this idea of corporate cyber responsibility,\n\nbecause as you know,\n\nthe vast majority is owned by the private sector,\n\nthey are now on the front lines,\n\nthey are on the front lines of the cyber fight.\n\nSo they have to recognize\n\nthat they have a really important role\n\nin managing that cyber risk and working with the agencies\n\nto help us mitigate that risk.\n\nSo this whole idea of corporate cyber responsibility,\n\nthe other one was cyber civil defense.\n\nMy friend Craig Newmark talks about this,\n\nbut I love to think about this\n\nin our campaign for secure our world.\n\nThe whole idea is make cyber hygiene as common as\n\nphysical hygiene.\n\nWashing your face, brushing your teeth,\n\nit's the whole campaign inspired by schoolhouse rock\n\nthat we did a whole music video.\n\nThe idea is you want to make cyber sexy and cool,\n\nnot something that's scary\n\nbecause if people are scared by things,\n\nthen their brain shuts down.\n\nMake it cool, make it fun, make cyber sexy,\n\nthat's been one of the things I've been driving towards.\n\nAnd then the last thing is secure by design.\n\nAnd that's make cyber sexy, make technology safe.\n\nFor decades, we've accepted a world where\n\ntechnology has been delivered to us full of vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so we've spent time glorifying the villains\n\nand blaming the victims.\n\nWe have to now hold vendors accountable\n\nfor designing and developing and testing and delivering\n\nsoftware and technology\n\nthat is specifically focused\n\non driving down the number of exploitable flaws.\n\nSo you think about those big ideas\n\nand that's what we've been driving towards.\n\nAgain, a lot of unfinished business.\n\nBut when you think about the continued ransomware attacks,\n\nwhen you think about the continued attacks from China,\n\nthat we can expect to continue,\n\nthese are not exotic attacks,\n\nthese are attacks that are using\n\nfor the most part, known vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so ensuring that the tech that we rely upon\n\nis as secure as possible is incredibly important as well.\n\nAnd I wanna ask you more about\n\nholding vendors accountable,\n\nby tying into the other thing you were saying about,\n\npublic private partnership and developing that rapport,\n\nhas been concerning to see how difficult it seems\n\nto have been for the telecoms\n\nto eradicate the Chinese hackers from their networks\n\nand to be certain or be very confident.\n\nHas there been progress\n\non some of those things that you're talking about\n\nin terms of being able to have that transparency\n\nand insight into what's actually going on?\n\nYeah, it's a really important question.\n\nSo after the revelations of these breaches,\n\nwe stood up what's called a Unified Coordination Group,\n\nwhich brings together the federal agencies, CISA, FBI,\n\nthe intelligence community.\n\nWe are focused on the response, so we are responding.\n\nFBI is going after, they're investigating,\n\ngoing after potential threat actors.\n\nThe IC folks like the National Security Agency are using\n\nwhat we see in the intelligence to understand\n\nthe extent of this intrusion by foreign actors.\n\nAnd we're coming together to work with\n\nthose known and suspected victims,\n\nand so we've been doing that for months now.\n\nI understand that some of the victims\n\nhave talked about being able to remediate these threats\n\nand I think that that's gonna be a long-term effort.\n\nI mean this has unfortunately been out in the press a lot\n\nand anything that gets-\n\nUnfortunately too!\n\nAnything that gets out there has the downside\n\nof having adversaries change their tactics.\n\nSo while I think the transparency to consumers is important,\n\nit also makes it more difficult\n\nto then find these actors within the networks.\n\nSo while they're using\n\nknown defects and technology to get in,\n\nonce they're in, they are hard to find.\n\nAnd in fact, CISA and this is one reason\n\nI'm so proud of the incredible technical talent of our team,\n\nit's one of the few agencies in the government\n\nthat have been able to find both volt typhoon\n\nwithin critical infrastructure as well as salt typhoon.\n\nAnd in fact, it was our work to find salt typhoon\n\nthat then led to law enforcement\n\nbeing able to identify virtual private servers\n\nthat were being leased by the adversaries.\n\nAnd then that unraveled the wider campaign.\n\nAnd that's just an example\n\nof some of the things that we're doing\n\nthat have helped improve our ability\n\nto manage the security of the .gov.\n\nBut this is a long-term effort, frankly,\n\nand I don't expect it to be remediated in the short term,\n\nthat's why at the end of the day,\n\nwe need to focus on resilience.\n\nOn the telecommunications infrastructure more broadly,\n\nwe have to understand that comms,\n\njust like my point on software and technology,\n\nthese systems were basically architected\n\nfor speed and efficiency,\n\nThey weren't built with security as top of mind,\n\nsecurity is in many ways in telecommunications\n\nand other aspects of critical infrastructure\n\nhas been bolted on because at the end of the day,\n\na lot of this technology was developed for speed,\n\nfor driving down cost, for cool features,\n\nsecurity was an afterthought and a bolt-on,\n\nand that's why we have a cybersecurity industry\n\nand jobs like mine.\n\nSo when I talk about the story of cybersecurity,\n\nI actually wanna work myself out of a job,\n\nI want to envision a future where ransomware\n\nis a shocking anomaly\n\nwhere damaging software vulnerabilities\n\nby nation state actors are as infrequent as plane crashes.\n\nA world where the technology\n\nthat we've come to rely on every hour of every day\n\nis first and foremost secure so that we can believe in\n\nwhat we are using\n\nand what is driving and powering our daily lives\n\nas something that is safe for ourselves, for our families,\n\nfor our small businesses.\n\nAnd that's the work that we've been catalyzing.\n\nThere's much more work to do,\n\nbut I think we have laid out a roadmap.\n\nAnd the most important thing\n\nabout getting those big ideas right,\n\nwas before we were able to put any of that into play,\n\nwas we had to have the right talent and the right culture.\n\nStarting from day one frankly, it was making sure\n\nthat we could retain the talent we have\n\nand then hire some of the incredible world class talent\n\nthat has been able to find these threat actors,\n\nhelp to eradicate and evict them,\n\nand then to ensure that we are working collaboratively\n\nwith our partners to help them drive down risk\n\nto the critical infrastructure Americans rely on.\n\nWhen you were talking before\n\nabout how in the wake of SolarWinds,\n\nthere were opportunities for CISA\n\nto expand its funding, its powers.\n\nDo you feel like the agency has the levers of control now\n\nthat it needs to do its work?\n\nWe are much bigger than when I started,\n\nin terms of number of people, we're about 3,400 people.\n\nWe've hired over 2,100 people since I came on board,\n\nwhich is pretty incredible when you think about\n\nthe talent that is very mission driven,\n\nbut they could go get paid a lot more money\n\nin the private sector,\n\nso really proud of that, our budget is nearly $3 billion.\n\nWe have much more authorities,\n\nto include some of the authorities we got\n\nout of the cyberspace solarium commission,\n\nlike the Joint Cyber Planning Office,\n\nwhich we made the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative,\n\nlike our ability to persistently hunt on federal networks.\n\nThat has allowed us to discover things like\n\nthe salt typhoon campaign that I mentioned.\n\nSo I think we are in great shape right now.\n\nWhat I would just tell my successor, first of all,\n\nyou're inheriting the best job in government.\n\nBut I would also say,\n\nlook, we are America's cyber defense agency.\n\nWhen you compare our size to the law enforcement agencies,\n\nthe investigative agencies or the intelligence agencies,\n\nwe are much smaller,\n\nbut I think we punch far above our weight.\n\nThe magic of CISA is the fact that\n\nwe are a partnership agency, a voluntary agency\n\nand everything we do is rooted\n\nin being able to catalyze trusted partnerships.\n\nAnd so it's not authorities\n\nto force compliance or enforcement.\n\nWe're not a regulator, we're not a military agency,\n\nwe don't collect intel, we don't do law enforcement.\n\nEverything we do is by, with and through partners,\n\nproviding no cost services and capabilities\n\nto enable critical infrastructure entities\n\nto manage and reduce risk.\n\nAnd I'm really proud of where we are,\n\nbut there's much, much more work to be done.\n\nAnd do you think the new administration\n\nwill be supportive of that?\n\nOn the one hand, in his first term,\n\npresident Trump was actually the one who elevated CISA\n\nto be an agency, full fledged agency.\n\nBut on the other hand, there have been some comments\n\nthat make it seem like perhaps his administration\n\nis no longer sort of putting a priority\n\non the mission of the agency.\n\nSo are you concerned about that?\n\nNo, I'm not concerned about it.\n\nI think anybody that takes a hard look at what CISA is,\n\nthe talent that we have,\n\nwhat we accomplished over the last several years\n\nwill appreciate the value that we bring\n\nto the American people.\n\nAnd CISA success is the success of the American people,\n\nit's national security.\n\nAnd while I know there's been a lot of\n\ndiscussion of politics and partisanship,\n\nat the end of the day,\n\ncybersecurity critical infrastructure security\n\nis not a political issue, it's not a partisan issue.\n\nAnd the American people understand that.\n\nAnd I grew up in a world\n\nwhere we didn't think at all about politics,\n\nI was a military officer,\n\nI worked for President George W. Bush, president Obama,\n\nnow President Biden, I am never driven by politics,\n\nI'm driven by mission.\n\nAnd I think that is very much the spirit and ethos\n\nof folks within CISA, we are very focused\n\non driving down risk to the American people.\n\nIf you just look at, for example, the elections,\n\nthe elections when election infrastructure\n\nwas designated as critical infrastructure in 2017,\n\nthat really was a no trust environment.\n\nThe states didn't want the federal government\n\nat all involved in elections,\n\nwhich are run by state and local officials.\n\nAnd it took a lot of work by my predecessor and that team\n\nand now my team to move from a no trust,\n\nlow trust environment to a pretty high trust environment.\n\nI mean, one of the things that I'm most proud about\n\nover the past several months\n\nwas our work with election officials across the country,\n\nto include some very conservative\n\nRepublican secretaries of State,\n\nspending time with Dave Scanlan up in New Hampshire\n\nwith Phil McGrane in Idaho.\n\nAnd then we spent time at the Midwest\n\nElection Security Summit with Bob Evnen of Nebraska,\n\nScott Schwab of Kansas,\n\nPaul Pate of Iowa, Jay Ashcroft of Missouri,\n\nMonae Johnson of South Dakota,\n\nand so this really shows people out in America\n\nwhere the work actually happens\n\nlook at us as an agency that is there to help.\n\nI think one of the things\n\nthat's been really important, Lily,\n\nis we have put an enormous amount of effort\n\ninto building our field force,\n\nas we've grown those 2,200 hirees,\n\nwe've built hundreds in our force of cybersecurity advisors,\n\nphysical security advisors who are out in every state\n\nto work with critical infrastructure owners and operators,\n\nbusinesses, large and small,\n\nto work with election officials,\n\nstate and local officials.\n\nAnd these are folks from those areas.\n\nSo while you may not, trust the federal government,\n\nif you're sitting in a state somewhere,\n\na very conservative state,\n\nyou trust your cybersecurity advisor\n\nwho you've known for years and years.\n\nAnd so that comes with sort of a built in ability\n\nto build those relationships.\n\nSo I'm very aware people don't trust institutions,\n\npeople trust people.\n\nAnd it's why everybody in CISA is very focused on\n\nnot only having the technical talent\n\nto enable us to understand and reduce risk,\n\nbut to build collaborative partnerships, right?\n\nIt's about developing those relationships\n\nto allow us to work together to reduce risk to the nation.\n\nAnd frankly, it's why I've been all over the world,\n\nall over the country to help us build that trust,\n\ncatalyze that trust, advance those partnerships\n\nin a way that we can work together\n\nfor the collective defense of the nation.\n\nLet's say this, defense is hard, right?\n\nWe know that.\n\nAnd when you were talking about holding vendors accountable,\n\nwanting to make these exploitable vulnerabilities,\n\na plane crash once in a blue moon rather than\n\nso common, are we getting there on that?\n\nIt feels like on endpoints on,\n\nin some ways there has been a lot of progress on,\n\nthat type of detection,\n\nbut then things move to the periphery,\n\nthey move to network devices, cloud,\n\nthe ongoing need for account hygiene and account security.\n\nSo are we winning, can you win at defense?\n\nDo you worry about that?\n\nYou're right, defense is hard.\n\nI say that as the America's cyber head goalie\n\nand that's why it has to be a team.\n\n'cause you need all those levers of power.\n\nAs much as we work to hunt for and eradicate Chinese actors\n\nand work with critical infrastructure to build resilience,\n\nour partners need to hold those actors accountable\n\nand to be able to hold our adversaries at risk.\n\nWhether that's through offensive cyber capabilities,\n\nwhether that's through indictments or sanctions,\n\nand so that's when we talk about cyber as a team sport.\n\nBut yes, we're on the defensive side and it's a challenge.\n\nI think we are making progress,\n\nwe have seen when we launched this\n\nsecure by design campaign, I like to call it the revolution,\n\nbut at the end of the day, this has been something that\n\nthere have been thought leaders talking about\n\nfor years and years and years.\n\nWe wanted to give it a platform\n\nthat was really highlighted\n\nby some of my fantastic technical experts.\n\nStarted working on this,\n\ntalked about it first in November of 2022,\n\nthen launched it at Carnegie Mellon\n\nin a big speech in early 2023,\n\nand then came together with our federal partners,\n\nwith international partners\n\nto start laying out the key principles for secure by design.\n\nLater that year,\n\nwe locked arms with our international partners,\n\nbut importantly, we worked very closely\n\nwith technology vendors.\n\nAnd you saw that in the pledge that we launched at RSA\n\nstarted out with 68 technology vendors, now we're over 260.\n\nAnd these are vendors who voluntarily committed\n\nto make significant and measurable progress on key areas,\n\nwhether that's enabling of multi-factor authentication,\n\nreducing default passwords, moving towards memory safety.\n\nAnd several of them have already started publishing\n\nprogress that they've made.\n\nAnd look, at the end of the day,\n\nthese technology vendors want to create safe products,\n\nit's just decades and decades\n\nwhere it hasn't been a priority,\n\nit's been driving down cost, it's been features,\n\nit's been speed to market for competition.\n\nAnd so I think we really have seen\n\nvendors grasping onto this.\n\nYou remember Ralph Nader wrote this bestselling book in 1965\n\nall about car crashes.\n\nCars were not focused on being safe,\n\nand I talk about secure by design\n\nas unsafe at any CPU speed.\n\nAnd you think about from 1965,\n\nI think it wasn't until 1983\n\nwhen the first state mandated use of seat belts.\n\nSo it took a long time.\n\nIt takes time, yeah.\n\nBut what I'm excited about Lily,\n\nis I think we can get there quicker.\n\nGPU speed.\n\nYes, maybe exactly, exactly.\n\nyou're going in my, you're speaking my language sister.\n\nSo it's AI,\n\nI think we can use the incredible power of AI\n\nand that's why we've been so excited about\n\nhow do we use generative artificial intelligence\n\nin large language models for cyber defense?\n\nSo when you think about, for example,\n\nnot to geek out on you too much,\n\nwhen you think about, when you think about\n\ntwo thirds of software vulnerabilities are memory safety\n\nvulnerabilities, right?\n\nSo buffer overflow or use after free vulnerabilities,\n\nand when you think about SQL injection,\n\nif you can drive down,\n\nif you can move from memory unsafe to memory safe.\n\nSo moving from C and C++ to things like Rust,\n\nrefactoring that code\n\ncan drive down the number of software vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd so I'm excited about how fast this is moving.\n\nI wanna make sure that these capabilities\n\nare built to also be secure by design.\n\nAnd so we've been extending\n\nwhat we've been working on in software into AI\n\nand that's been a huge effort\n\nand a lot of fun, frankly,\n\nunder the leadership of our Chief AI officer.\n\nBut just think about using these capabilities.\n\nThis can accelerate our ability\n\nto get to a secure by design future.\n\nAnd what does that mean?\n\nIt doesn't mean perfect cybersecurity,\n\nwe're never gonna get to perfect cybersecurity,\n\nbut what we can get to is a technology ecosystem\n\nthat is much safer, much more secure,\n\nand frankly, defensible.\n\nSo driving down the number of exploitable defects,\n\nexploitable flaws that can really be accelerated\n\nby the use of generative AI,\n\nso I'm super pumped about that.\n\nSo I have to ask you, there's rumors,\n\nare you or are you not going on tour when you leave CISA?\n\nI certainly hope to be,\n\nyou and I actually met over a mutual friend Meryl Goldberg.\n\nYou wrote a fantastic article about\n\nher time in a Klezmer band\n\nand being in the Soviet Union and encoding music.\n\nAnd she and I ran into each other in the green room at RSA\n\nand I saw these instruments, the saxophone,\n\nand I was like, oh my gosh, what's happening?\n\nAnd that started this wonderful friendship.\n\nWe have bonded over music.\n\nI played piano and guitar when I was young,\n\nbut I really started with electric guitar\n\nwhen my son started taking it up during COVID.\n\nOh, there you go.\n\nAnd it's been the thing that has,\n\nbecause I love all kinds of music,\n\nthat's what's behind the joint Cyber Defense Collaborative.\n\nBut I started taking up electric guitar\n\nand that has been become my passion, my obsession.\n\nAnd as we were really focused on election security\n\nover the past couple months, I wasn't able to practice,\n\nbut now I'm getting back to it.\n\nSo I hope my big post-retirement plan several years from now\n\nis to start this bar, to have a band.\n\nWe're gonna do magic, we're gonna do improv,\n\nI'm gonna be the bartender, and so.\n\nIs there gonna be a cyber tie in or?\n\nWell, there'll always be some cyber tie in.\n\nMy team, I really wanted to start my own podcast in this job\n\ncalled, Bourbon and Bites,\n\n'cause I'm a big old fashioned fan,\n\nbut they didn't like the whole bourbon thing.\n\nSo there could be some podcasting from the bar.\n\nThere you go, okay.\n\nBut the cyber will always\n\nbe a part of my life no matter what I do.\n\nSomething I've done forever\n\nand I'm very passionate about the importance of\n\nensuring that we secure our world.\n\nFor everybody from K through Gray.\n\nAnd it's one of the things that's been motivating me\n\nto make cyber sexy and make tech safe.\n\nWill there be Rubik's cubes\n\nat every table in the bar?\n\nThere will, there will be Rubik's Cubes.\n\nI'm also sort of obsessed with the Rubik's Cube\n\nand I think we might have talked about this before,\n\nbut, so this is actually a CISA Cube\n\nand I like to think of it as a kind of a magic cube.\n\nBut let's see here, oh, there we go, all right, so.\n\nOh, there we go.\n\nThere we go, solve this CISA cube.\n\nBut I love this thing because when I was 11,\n\nthese things were introduced into the world\n\nand I was a huge puzzler and a video game person,\n\nand I became obsessed with it, learned how to solve it,\n\nand then I would go to toy stores,\n\nsay, I was this little kid with pigtails,\n\nif I can solve this in less than two minutes,\n\nwill you give me a free one?\n\nSo I was able to amass this whole.\n\nThe whole trove.\n\nAnd the reason I love it is because Erno Rubik,\n\nwho invented the thing, talked about, if you are curious,\n\nyou will find the puzzles around you.\n\nAnd if you are determined, you will solve them.\n\nAnd when I think about\n\nthe type of incredible technical talent\n\nthat we have here at CISA,\n\nyou think about the intellectual curiosity,\n\nit's the hacker mindset, it's the problem solver,\n\nbut it's the determination, the relentless drive\n\nto solve the most complicated problems out there.\n\nAnd that's, sort of symbolized in the CISA Cube.\n\nWell, it's really a pleasure to talk to you.\n\nYou as well.\n\nThanks so much for joining us.\n\nThank you as well, Lily.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nIt's hard to imagine life without Apple,\n\nbecause my life has been wrapped up in this company,\n\nas you've mentioned, since 1998.\n\nThis is a long time.\n\nIt's the overwhelming majority of my adult life,\n\nand so I love it.\n\nI'm Steven Levy.\n\nToday we sat down with Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nto discuss the company's past, present, and future.\n\nThis is The Big Interview.\n\nThank you for doing The Big Interview, Tim.\n\nThank you for being here, Steven.\n\nIt's always great to talk to you.\n\nYeah, well it's great to be at Apple Park.\n\nI'm looking this backdrop.\n\nI remember you gave me a tour of this place.\n\nYeah.\n\nBefore people moved in.\n\nAnd what about this place, working in here,\n\nand having your people in here\n\nis either unexpected or striking.\n\nIt's promoted collaboration even more than I thought.\n\nAnd that was a key component of the design, as you know.\n\nBut there's so many places in here\n\nthat you unexpectedly run into people.\n\nYou do it at the cafeteria, you do it at the coffee bar,\n\nyou do it outside when you're going across the pathway.\n\nAnd I think that promotes this unplanned collaboration.\n\nAnd I think it's fantastic.\n\nAlso, there's a connection here to Steve.\n\nYou know, of course we have the theater named after him,\n\nand think about him all the time.\n\nBut I can feel him in other spaces in here.\n\nHe had a perspective that the venue\n\nthat you worked in was so important to the work,\n\nand I think that he's been proven right.\n\nYou mentioned the theater.\n\nWill you do product launches now?\n\nYou do pre-tapes,\n\nor are you ever gonna see live launches\n\nin the Steve Jobs theater again like we used to?\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe thing that we learned during COVID was,\n\nyou know, the audience is primarily an online audience.\n\nVery few people can fit in the theater,\n\nand we wanted to have more people engaged\n\nin the announcements itself.\n\nAnd you can do\n\nthat a lot more productively on tape than you can in live,\n\nbecause of the transitions on the stage and so forth.\n\nBut you don't miss the vibe.\n\nI do miss it. I do miss it.\n\nI get it when the WWDC is here, and we announced the film\n\nand feel the love from the developers is fantastic.\n\nI heard something interesting recently that Stevie Wonder\n\nhad a demo of the Vision Pro and loved it.\n\nHow's that work?\n\nHe's a friend of Apple.\n\nIt's great to get feedback from Stevie,\n\nand of course his artistry is just unparalleled.\n\nHe's so fantastic.\n\nBut accessibility was always important\n\nfor us from designing all of our products,\n\nas you know, that's one of the common threads\n\nthrough Apple over time,\n\nis that we don't bolt on accessibility at the end\n\nof the design process, it's embedded in the design process.\n\nAnd so getting that feedback was key.\n\nSo I wanna look back a little bit\n\nthrough your time here.\n\nYou've been here a long time.\n\nYou got here in 1998.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThere had already been eras of Apple.\n\nThere had been the Apple II era.\n\nThe Mac, the diaspora era where Steve was gone.\n\nYou were a compact.\n\nDid you think that at any point watching\n\nwhat was going on that Apple was just not gonna make it?\n\nYou know, I probably thought that\n\nbefore talking to Steve.\n\nAt that time,\n\nif you remember Michael Dell had said if he was the CEO,\n\nhe would shut Apple down.\n\nAnd just return whatever assets were\n\nleft to the shareholders.\n\nAnd Michael just said what most everyone else thought.\n\nBut I have to say, when I came out to talk\n\nto Steve about working at Apple, it felt\n\nso alive and so different.\n\nHe was somebody\n\nthat was the most unusual CEO I'd ever met.\n\nHe was passionate about the product, passionate about Apple,\n\npassionate about its reason for being its purpose.\n\nAnd I thought, I've gotta do this.\n\nI want to do this.\n\nAnd from that point, I never thought\n\nthat Apple would be going out of business.\n\nAnd other people did,\n\nand other people advised me, why are you doing this?\n\nYou're leaving the world's largest personal computer company\n\nand going to one that may not survive.\n\nBut I didn't feel that way at that point\n\nafter talking to Steve.\n\nSo while you're here in your collaboration with Steve,\n\nyou know, Apple came out with, you know.\n\nThese great design products, the iMac,\n\nthen the iPod era, which was so exciting.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThere were so many different versions\n\nof iPods, then of course the iPhone.\n\nYes.\n\nLooking back, what did you do that was smart\n\nthat you really didn't think was going to be\n\nso impactful in making that product a success?\n\nWell, I think each product that you named sort\n\nof had its place in history.\n\nThe iMac revived Apple, it kind\n\nof proved Apple could survive.\n\nThe iPod giving people 1,000 songs in the pocket,\n\nsomething very unexpected,\n\nand solving a pain point that all of us had\n\nthat loved music.\n\nIt began to introduce people to more people,\n\nparticularly in the developed markets.\n\nAnd the decision to port to Windows proved\n\nthat Apple could come out with a product\n\nthat was larger than the Mac community.\n\nAnd then iPhone built on everything\n\nthat came before it.\n\nAnd with the great work\n\nfrom the technology team on multi-touch,\n\nit gave you a totally different way\n\nof interfacing with the product.\n\nAnd then what iPhone did looking back, was introduce people\n\nto Apple in the emerging markets.\n\nGoing out and forming all\n\nof these carry relationships was very important\n\nto introducing Apple more broadly\n\nand sort of turning the industry on its side\n\nand owning the design.\n\nBecause at that time, if you remember,\n\nthe carrier was owning the design of the phone,\n\nwas sort of directing it.\n\nAnd we said, no no, what we bring is the product skill.\n\nAnd what they brought was the networking skill.\n\nAnd we didn't have the networking skill\n\nand frankly they didn't have the product skill.\n\nAnd so this combination was very powerful.\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nWell, we're beginning maybe a new era of history now\n\nwith AI.\n\nApple Intelligence.\n\nI mean, do you think this is something\n\nthat is gonna wind up reinventing the company\n\nand reinventing the world?\n\nAre you on the cusp of that?\n\nI do. I think it's profound.\n\nI think just like multi-touch enabled iPhone\n\nand eventually iPad, and the modern smartphone,\n\nand the modern tablet, AI will reinvent\n\nand it provide a new era and a new chapter for iPhone\n\nand iPad, and the Mac, and all of our products over time.\n\nBecause I think it changes the way you interface\n\nwith the products.\n\nI get so much out of Apple Intelligence,\n\nand we're just at the beginning.\n\nSo Siri is one thing that's being revitalized here.\n\nI'm wondering, are we going\n\nto eventually have this relationship with Siri\n\nthat'll be our constant companion\n\nand we'll do, for instance,\n\neverything we might wanna do in search, instead of going\n\nto Google, we'll just ask Siri.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nBut I think, I use Siri a lot now.\n\nI'm a power user of Siri,\n\nand so I'm some of the billion five requests\n\nthat Siri gets every day.\n\nSo I already have a relationship with Siri,\n\nbut I think more people will,\n\nbecause Siri will become more personally relevant\n\nand be able to take task off your plate\n\nthat you don't have to do.\n\nAnd sort of a multi-step kind of approach\n\nthat you saw some of the demos do.\n\nSo I couldn't be more excited about the future of Siri.\n\nYou are the CEO.\n\nYou've been here for a while.\n\nHow long do you see yourself continuing this role?\n\nOh, I don't know.\n\nI get asked\n\nthat question now more than I used to.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nAs I age, as my hair turns gray,\n\nI love this place, Steven.\n\nI love it.\n\nAnd I love the people I work with.\n\nIt's a privilege of a lifetime to be here.\n\nAnd I'll do it\n\nuntil the voice in my head says it's time.\n\nAnd then I'll go and focus on\n\nwhat the next chapter looks like.\n\nMy life has been wrapped up in this company,\n\nas you mentioned, since 1998.\n\nThis is a long time.\n\nIt's the overwhelming majority of my adult life.\n\nAnd so it's tough to envision life without Apple.\n\nSo one more question.\n\nWhen we were all talking about the tour\n\nand things like that, I was also doing a story\n\nabout the Infinite Loop, One Infinite Loop.\n\nThat which used to be the Apple's headquarters.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd you told me\n\nthat you didn't move into Steve's office.\n\nI didn't.\n\nAfter he died, it was preserved.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that sometimes you would go in there.\n\n[Tim] Yes.\n\nAnd get inspired by being in the surroundings.\n\n[Tim] Yes.\n\nDo you still do that?\n\nIs that office still preserved?\n\nI still do that. The office is still preserved.\n\nNo one's ever moved in there.\n\nAnd that's been since 2011 as you know.\n\nMost of what we do is forward looking.\n\nBut I like my connection back to Steve,\n\nand I like the company's connection back to Steve,\n\nbecause from him emanates our values and our DNA.\n\nSo I think that connection's important.\n\nSo Tim, thank you so much for doing The Big Interview.\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nIt's so great to spend time with you.\n\nAs always.\n\nI'll bump into you in Palo Alto again.\n\nAlright. Yeah, in a few days.\n\nIn a few days.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nAlright.\n\n[uplifting music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nI don't think our next guest needs much of an introduction,\n\nbut I've been given one, so I'm excited\n\nto welcome entrepreneur co-founder of Cost Plus Drugs,\n\nMark Cuban to the big interview stage\n\nfrom selling garbage bags door to door at age 12\n\nto founding a lot of groundbreaking tech companies,\n\nMark has always been ahead of the curve.\n\nIt's really no surprise that\n\nwith his latest venture Cost Plus Drugs,\n\nhe's also ahead of the curve.\n\nHe is working to demolish\n\nand rebuild the prescription drug industry.\n\nAnd that's what we're gonna talk about today.\n\nEveryone, please welcome Mark Cuban.\n\n[audience cheering]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMark, thank you so much for being here.\n\nI liked how you changed fuck up to demolish, you know?\n\nIt's a family friendly event.\n\nOh, then I should leave right now.\n\nThis is just like Shark Tank.\n\nSo I asked a friend here, actually, Sean, earlier today,\n\nI said, what should I, what should I kick off\n\nMark Cuban with?\n\nWhat should I say?\n\nAnd he said,\n\nwhy don't you give him a belated\n\ncongratulations for Klay Thompson.\n\nOh, there you go, Klay's killer.\n\nYeah, we thank everybody here for today.\n\nYeah, you're lucky that you're welcome in the Bay.\n\nI know.\n\nAfter that one actually.\n\nTrust me, I look over my shoulder.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nAll right, so let's talk about Cost Plus.\n\nWhen you actually,\n\nwhen our issue came out in which you're prominently\n\nfeatured, one thing I heard from people was,\n\nI didn't know Mark Cuban was in the pharmaceutical business.\n\nYou've been doing this for a while though.\n\nWhy did you get into pharma?\n\nDoes anybody here like their healthcare?\n\nDoes anybody here think the healthcare industry works well?\n\nThat's why, I mean,\n\nI literally got a cold email from a Dr. Alex Vishinsky\n\nwho wanted to start up a compounding pharmacy,\n\nwhich actually makes drugs that are on, in this case,\n\non short supply, that are on the shortage list.\n\nAnd I'm like, you're thinking too small.\n\nAnd that was right around the time Martin Shkreli\n\nwas going to jail.\n\nSo he was in the news\n\nand I was like, how can this one guy take control\n\nof this drug and jack up the price that dramatically?\n\nAnd so I'm like, let me just take a look.\n\nAnd when you look at the pharmaceutical industry, back then,\n\nit was very obvious that it was opaque.\n\nThere was no transparency at all.\n\nI mean, think about it.\n\nIf you get a prescription from your doctor,\n\nwhat's the first thing they ask you?\n\nNot can you afford it?\n\nIt's what pharmacy do you use?\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nAnd then you've gotta deal with the fear\n\nof can you afford it or what's the impact?\n\nWhat's the copay, what's the deductible?\n\nAll those things.\n\nSo we said, okay,\n\nlet's start a company called costplusdrugs.com\n\nand let's make it transparent.\n\nAnd it seems so simple, but the impact has been so dramatic.\n\nSo if you go to costplusdrugs.com\n\nand you put in the name of the medication\n\nand we've grown from a 111 to 2,500\n\nand we have more to go, you'll, if we carry it,\n\nthe medication pops up and you'll see our actual cost.\n\nSo we'll show you what we pay for it,\n\nwe mark it up 15%, if you want it delivered,\n\nand then there's a $5 pharmacist fee that's included\n\nbecause you have to have a pharmacist review it\n\nand then $5 to ship it to you.\n\nOr you can, now we have an affiliate network\n\nwhere you can pick it up at a local pharmacy just\n\nby showing our price, our cost, and only marking up 15%,\n\nwe were able to take down the price\n\nof drugs like Imatinib chemotherapy,\n\ndrug, MS drugs from like 2000 plus dollars a month\n\nto $21 a month, $35 a month.\n\nSo the impact has been insane.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nWhat are some of the common drugs people\n\nmight recognize that you're manufacturing and selling?\n\nI mean, you know, Imatinib is probably\n\nthe most dramatic example.\n\nI don't, I'm not the pharmacist,\n\nremember all the funky names.\n\nBut people with MS as an example, we are able to take,\n\nthere's a drug called Daroxadopa that\n\nI'll give you the, I'll give you a scenario.\n\nA friend of mine was in this horrific car accident\n\nand he needed to take this drug and lost his insurance.\n\nEmailed me and said, okay, they're telling me it's going\n\nto be $10,000 every three months.\n\nI'm like, okay, Landon, I'll check into it.\n\nTurns out we carried it\n\nand when we carried it back then it was $64 a month\n\nfrom 10,000 to 64 times three.\n\nAnd now it's in the $20.\n\nBecause as our volumes go up,\n\nbecause we do everything on a straight markup,\n\nour costs go down.\n\nAnd literally we have lowered the price\n\nof a medication every single weekday\n\nfor the past almost 18 months.\n\nAnd so if you think about it,\n\n[audience cheering]\n\nbut the most dramatic thing we did was unintentional.\n\nWe published our entire price list.\n\nAnd so there's places, if you really looked hard, you can go\n\nand find a price for a medication that you might need.\n\nBut there's no place where the\n\ncompany published their entire price list.\n\nAnd we did that for all 2,500 drugs.\n\nAnd what's happened now is that researchers are able to use\n\nthat price list to compare to what the government is paying\n\nfor things to compare to what states are paying.\n\nAnd if you have a company that self insures\n\nto start the process of allowing you to compare\n\nwhat the company pays for the medications\n\nthat their employees and the you know, the people\n\nthat they cover, the population, they cover what they pay.\n\nAnd that has just been a game changer.\n\nI mean, we've had researchers from Vanderbilt, Harvard,\n\nall these different places say, you know, if,\n\nyou know Medicare bought these nine drugs\n\nfrom Cost Plus Drugs, just nine drugs\n\nwould save $3.6 billion a year if they\n\nbought these 11 drugs that, you know, they might,\n\nit's $6.3 billion a year.\n\nI mean, it's insane.\n\nAnd literally, you know, for so many folks out here\n\nin the Valley,\n\nprobably the easiest way to raise money\n\nand put cash in your own pocket is\n\nto change your healthcare plan.\n\nAnd in particular, your pharmacy benefit manager.\n\nBecause the crux of this problem\n\nand the opacity of the industry,\n\nthere are three pharmacy benefit managers that control, give\n\nor take 80% of the market.\n\nSo these are basically, these are the middlemen?\n\nThe middlemen, yeah.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd literally, they don't want you to know what you pay.\n\nIf you work with a self-insured company\n\nand they're working with one of the big three one,\n\nlet's just say the biggest PBMs,\n\nyou're getting ripped off, guaranteed.\n\nThe quickest way is to raise money if you have over\n\n100 employees and self-insure is\n\nto change your healthcare program.\n\nAnd in particular, pharmacy benefit manager,\n\nthat's immediate cash in the bank.\n\nAnd you know, companies don't really realize that.\n\nAnd that's why it's been so successful.\n\nBecause the next question always is how did this happen?\n\nAnd the reality is there's 155 million people covered\n\nby self-insured employers.\n\nAnd it's not the core competency of a CEO\n\nto understand all their healthcare benefits.\n\nYou just don't, I mean, like.\n\nYou could ask a couple of them here\n\non stage today if you want.\n\nHappy to.\n\nYeah, you should.\n\nBrian Chesky, let's talk to him about health.\n\nYou know, and you say.\n\nYeah, Jensen Wong,\n\nI'm sure he wants to talk about health plans.\n\nYeah, Jensen, you know, just say, would you?\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nAsk them, why are you dealing with one\n\nof the big pharmacy benefit managers and ask them, is that,\n\nbecause here's what's happening that's crazy\n\nthat they're gonna be, here's why,\n\nthey're starting to understand there's a law called\n\nERISA that requires the employer now\n\nto take on their fiduciary responsibility for the cost\n\nand care of all the lives they cover for as employers.\n\nAnd J and J and Wells Fargo just got sued\n\nand they're gonna lose.\n\nWhich effectively means\n\nthat every single major self-insured employer is going\n\nto get sued in a class action suit.\n\nAnd so if any of you fall into that trap, get ready,\n\nthey're coming.\n\nBut the bigger point again, is\n\nnow there's transparency for medications.\n\nAnd you can cut the cost,\n\nwhether you're a little company or a big company.\n\nAnd if you have a high deductible or you\n\nor you're uninsured, always check the pricing,\n\n'cause otherwise you're gonna get ripped off.\n\nSo you've made it pretty clear you're not doing this\n\nfor altruistic reasons.\n\nYou're running a business.\n\nYou want this to be a profitable business.\n\nI think people hear about what you're doing\n\nand they think, oh, it's altruistic.\n\nLike it's because you're doing something good.\n\nWell, I could make more money.\n\nRight?\n\nBut, what you said in.\n\nSeriously, but we're a public benefit corporation,\n\nbut how much fucking money do I need?\n\nYou know, I'm not trying to land on Mars.\n\nYou know, it's just,\n\n[group laughing]\n\n[audience cheering]\n\nand not to take anything away from him\n\nfor trying, more power to him.\n\nBut the reality is, I mean, at this point in my life,\n\nit's just like, more money, fuck up the healthcare industry?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nThat was, that was the word I left out of the intro.\n\nYou guys.\n\nF-U-C-K the healthcare industry.\n\nBut how did you, but I guess\n\nwhat I'm getting at is like, how did you decide on\n\nthat being the industry you wanted to go after?\n\nBecause it was so obvious that it would be easy to change\n\nthat it was insane.\n\nWhat had happened in the past is I dug in more,\n\nand we've been in business now, we started shipping,\n\nyou know, two and a half years ago.\n\nAnd you know, now we have millions of people\n\nwhose lives we've changed.\n\nBut you start to realize that\n\nwhat the incumbents would do is they'd go in\n\nand just buy companies.\n\nSo anybody that was a threat, they'd just buy 'em.\n\nAnd one after another, we'd go into situations\n\nwhere we're talking to employers or whatever,\n\nand they're saying, yeah, we were gonna do\n\nbusiness with this company.\n\nAnd they were trying to cut the cost,\n\nbut then so and so bought 'em.\n\nAnd like I said that's just not in the cards for us.\n\nLet's talk about tariffs.\n\n[Mark] Tariffs.\n\nTariffs.\n\n[Mark] Okay.\n\nSo President-elect Donald Trump is.\n\nI know who he is, yeah.\n\nYou heard of him?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nOkay, so he said that he's planning\n\nto impose tariffs Canada, Mexico, China day one.\n\nWe don't know exactly how that's gonna shake out yet,\n\nbut we do know that this could affect the drug industry.\n\nI mean, he's referring often to the illegal drug industry.\n\nBut also this could affect\n\nthe pharmaceutical business.\n\nHow is this potentially going to affect Cost Plus Drugs?\n\nI mean, if it's just China, it won't impact us at all.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nI mean, because we had,\n\n'cause I checked, we had 16 drugs that we bought\n\nthat were shipped from China\n\nand we're changing that to a different manufacturer.\n\nSo the Chinese tariffs won't impact us at all.\n\nAnd now we do get drugs from India.\n\nSo we'll see what happens there.\n\nBut if there are tariffs, our, we only have 15%.\n\nAnd so, you know, we'd have to pass them through.\n\nPass them through meaning the cost goes to the consumer?\n\nRight, the cost would go up 'cause our cost would go up.\n\nOkay.\n\nHave you talked to Donald Trump about this?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nSure, I was like, yo, what's up bro?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nNo, I have not.\n\nYou have not?\n\nIf the conversation were to occur,\n\nif you were invited to have,\n\nwhat's your priority?\n\nWhat's the first thing you would say?\n\nI would say don't fuck it up.\n\nIt's working.\n\nYou know, I mean, I don't look, there's no point in trying\n\nto guess what he's going to do and speculate,\n\n'cause we don't know, I don't think he knows yet.\n\nI think he's trying to, you know, he plays it by feel\n\nand it'll go where he goes and we will react accordingly.\n\nBut I think, you know, he's obviously very cognizant of PR\n\nand the idea that medications from the cheapest provider are\n\ngoing up and it means more\n\npeople aren't able to afford it.\n\nI really don't think he's going in that direction, you know,\n\nI really think he'd make an exception.\n\nYou were clearly a vocal supporter\n\nof Kamala Harris for president.\n\nWhen you look back at?\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nYou see how good a job I did?\n\n[group laughing]\n\nWhen you look at, when you look back at this election\n\nseason, is there anything\n\nthat you think you would've done differently\n\nor taken a different approach in terms of\n\nhow you were communicating?\n\nNot really, I mean, I'm not the candidate.\n\nI did the best I could to try to convey, you know,\n\nwhat she was doing for business people,\n\nsmall business, you know.\n\nAnd I think, you know, the message was good,\n\nbut, you know, they weren't voting or not voting for me.\n\nYeah.\n\nOne of the things\n\nthat we talked about when we did the big interview in the\n\nmagazine was crypto.\n\nAnd, you know, you feel pretty strongly\n\nand you're in favor of crypto\n\nand you were in favor of it not being villainized.\n\nAnd you felt as though that's\n\nwhat Gary Gensler and the SEC had been doing.\n\nAnd I think it really hurt her.\n\nSo you do?\n\nYeah, I really do.\n\nSo what's interesting is, because my response to you was,\n\nisn't that sort of a fringe issue?\n\nAnd you said no, but in a?\n\nHow many people here own crypto?\n\nAnd so when the price go, when crypto go up,\n\neverybody smile, you know?\n\nAnd if, when, you know, if you're,\n\nparticularly if you're a young male\n\nand you're not part of the traditional banking system,\n\nyou know, when I was a kid, open up a bank account,\n\nopen up a savings account, now download an app, right?\n\nRobinhood or Coinbase buy crypto\n\nbecause your friends are buying crypto,\n\nyou understand it more.\n\nMaybe you buy stocks,\n\nbut more kids were getting into crypto\n\nand that was their net worth.\n\nAnd when 40%, according to Pew research\n\nof young men own crypto or have owned crypto,\n\nand the guy you're connected to,\n\nGary Gensler is basically telling you to roll over\n\nand let me stick a bike handle in your ass that just like.\n\nA what?\n\nYeah, I was gonna say worse,\n\nbut I was just going, yeah, that was stupid.\n\nSorry, but basically you say.\n\n[Host] Did you say a bike handle?\n\nYeah, forget it.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nI'm sure that's something Elon will tweet about at me.\n\nBut in any event,\n\nbut Gary Gensler did not make it good\n\nfor people who own crypto.\n\nAnd I think that truly hurt Kamala\n\nand I even said it, I said it to her, I said it to her team,\n\nI said it publicly that Gary Gensler could lose the election\n\nfor her, and you know, when there's what,\n\n240,000 votes across seven swing states,\n\nand the number of men, young men\n\nwho voted against her was much higher than expected.\n\nI don't think it's a stretch to connect the two.\n\nWhat happens to crypto now?\n\nI think, you know, it's, you know, the laissez-faire,\n\nit's whatever comes, comes, you know.\n\nBut it was interesting when he talked about putting, if any\n\nof the BRICS countries stopped using the dollar\n\nas the de facto reserve currency,\n\nthat he was gonna put tariffs on then,\n\nwhich is the antithesis of what people who gave him a lot\n\nof money and support Bitcoin think they, you know,\n\nthey think a big part of the value\n\nof Bitcoin is the fact that fiat currency is weak\n\nand the Federal Reserve weakens it\n\nand it doesn't have a great future.\n\nSo here's Bitcoin to save the day.\n\nSo it'll be interesting to see if he follows through on that\n\nand what the Bitcoin Maxis think about it.\n\nDoes, I mean, is this a moment where Bitcoin\n\nand other crypto currencies actually become more legitimate\n\nor less under?\n\nIt's not about legitimate, it's like gold, right?\n\nI mean god, it's not based off the supply\n\nand demand on jewelry, right?\n\nPeople see it as an option in the event of, you know,\n\nthe economy going down or something bad happening.\n\nBut people aren't gonna walk around with gold bars.\n\nOh look, he owns gold.\n\nBam, now I own gold.\n\nBam, right?\n\nWhat are you gonna do it?\n\nLet me slice you\n\noff a little piece of gold.\n\nYou know?\n\nAnd no people look at it, you know,\n\nFort Knox has got a ton of gold that the United States owns,\n\nyou know, and it's supposed to be an underlying asset\n\nor commodity for the dollar in some respects, right?\n\nTo buy and sell and people look at Bitcoin\n\nas a better version of gold.\n\nAnd I agree with that, I think it's a great store of value.\n\nIt's easier to buy and sell.\n\nYou can fractionalize it, you can buy things,\n\nyou can transfer it internationally.\n\nAnd so I think it has more value than gold.\n\nSo I don't think you have to legitimize it,\n\nbut in terms of the price, you know, I own enough\n\nthat I really want it to go up.\n\nBut it's just supply and demand.\n\nHow much do you own?\n\nA lot.\n\nGlad we got that out of the way.\n\nWe have 10 minutes left\n\nand there's so much I want to ask you about.\n\nI feel like we could talk about crypto the whole time.\n\nI also wanted to ask you about AI,\n\nbut I think we're, one thing I'll say about AI,\n\nand then we should move on from it into the platforms,\n\nis that when, when we spoke for the big interview,\n\nyou asked me,\n\nwhat would you trust more in an environment if you like,\n\nyou weren't able to see, you said a, what is it\n\na self-driving car or a seeing eye dog?\n\n[Mark] Right, right, right.\n\nAnd I said a Waymo and you said, I trust the dog.\n\nAnd I just wanna say,\n\nwhile you're here in San Francisco, you should take a Waymo.\n\nNo, I want to actually.\n\nYeah, so if someone here, if anyone would like\n\nto pull up their app and get a Waymo ride\n\nfor Mark Cuban on this.\n\nI can do that, I know how to download the app.\n\nHe'll pay for it.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nBut the difference is a dog will recognize adversarial\n\nsituations better than AI can.\n\nRight, when you were talking about\n\ntraining the video and all that.\n\nBut I, let's talk about the platforms\n\nbecause you are a very active twitterer.\n\nYou're not using it quite as much anymore.\n\nNearly at all.\n\nYou've gone to Blue Sky.\n\nHow would you describe this moment\n\nfor, I'm just gonna call it Twitter.\n\nHow would you describe this moment for Twitter?\n\nI think it's an existential moment for Twitter.\n\nI really do.\n\nI go over to Blue Sky\n\nand I can engage like it's, you know, 2015\n\nor 2016 like we did on Twitter.\n\nAnd literally, I can talk about the Mavs\n\nand people aren't going to come in\n\nand say fuck, the Mavs, you're an asshole.\n\nYou know, you look like.\n\n[Host] You took Klay Thompson.\n\nYeah, you took Klay Thompson.\n\nOh, I get some of those but that's okay.\n\nOr you look like Rachel Maddow when you wear glasses,\n\nyou know.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nYou know just dumb shit.\n\nThat's the tame stuff.\n\nYou know whats crazy.\n\nNo, it's crazy.\n\nI counted, so whenever Elon would talk shit to me,\n\nI would just bookmark it on Twitter\n\nand somebody said that he said something\n\nand I would just check and he had it.\n\nBut I just decided to count\n\nhow many times he has posted about me\n\nor replied about me in the last 12 months.\n\nMore than 40 times, I stopped at 40.\n\nAnd it's just like, what the fuck?\n\nYou know, I mean, I don't mind going back and forth at him,\n\nbut who, like we talked\n\nbefore, whoever controls the algorithm,\n\ncontrols the platform.\n\nAnd when you have an algorithm that defines\n\nwhat happens on the platform\n\nand what you see, you get one type of engagement,\n\nwhen you go to Blue Sky where you completely control\n\nthe experience,\n\nyou get a completely different type of engagement.\n\nAnd so I can talk about Cost Plus Drugs and really engage.\n\nI can talk about, you know, I can see other discussions\n\nand jump in and ask questions.\n\nAnd it was, it's been great.\n\nI mean, literally,\n\nand when some idiot comes along, like somebody\n\nwho comes over from Twitter who likes\n\nto give me there comes on, not only can you block 'em\n\nand it's a real block,\n\nbut you can do this thing if you started the thread\n\nwhere you can say hide reply for everyone,\n\nthat's like the best thing in the world ever.\n\nBecause, you know, I want to talk about the Mavs\n\nor Cost Plus or whatever, and troll comes in, troll gone.\n\nAnd the one thing about a troll is a troll wants\n\nto be seen, right?\n\nIf you know, within 15 minutes you're gone\n\nand nobody's gonna see what you posted,\n\nthere's no point in continuing to fight it,\n\nparticularly since you truly can't see my post.\n\nAnd even if they, you know, create burner accounts\n\nor whatever to try to get in,\n\nit just takes two seconds to do it.\n\nAnd so as a result, you know,\n\nI forget the topic I was talking about,\n\nbut I counted, I literally counted that there was over five.\n\nAnd if you go to Blue Sky, I'm MCuban,\n\nand you'll see my reference to this,\n\nthat there were 526 responses to something\n\nand only five trolls posted.\n\nAnd that took me just a minute to clean 'em out.\n\nAnd it was a great conversation.\n\nI mean, just.\n\nDo you feel like there, that the Blue Sky\n\nis in any way just becoming an echo chamber\n\nof the people who decided that Twitter was too toxic\n\nor too right wing for them.\n\nTo a certain extent yes.\n\nAnd now they've just moved over to Blue Sky?\n\nTo a certain extent yes.\n\nSo how in a sense, how does that fix anything?\n\nIt doesn't matter, right?\n\nBecause, you know, if I want to talk like the Mavs, right?\n\nSo I went to a bunch of sports writers\n\nand there's these things called Sport Starter Packs\n\non Blue Sky.\n\nAnd they were all in there, and I said.\n\nWe have a Wired one, follow it.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe Wire starter pack.\n\nAnd you see what happens.\n\nI can engage with them and talk Mavs and see where it goes.\n\nAnd you know, like Ben Shapiro, he has an account there\n\nand I can engage with him.\n\nI may agree or disagree,\n\nbut if I start the thread, I have control of it.\n\nAnd if it turns out to be a legitimate argument\n\nor discussion, that's great.\n\nAnd you know the point being\n\nthat whoever controls the Thread controls the conversation\n\nand it can open it up to anybody they want.\n\nAnd there's no for you page, you know,\n\nso it's not like it's dominated by everything\n\nthat Elon says.\n\nIt's dominated, you know, it's dominated\n\nby the people you follow or the list that you create\n\nor the feeds that you follow.\n\nAnd so you get to really engage and that's, it's cool.\n\nI mean, it's just like all that intellectual engagement\n\nthat we kind of miss from Twitter where it was like, oh,\n\nthis is a great topic, I want to learn more.\n\nOr I'm just, you know,\n\nwatching these people have this conversation, it's amazing.\n\nAnd there's, you know, yeah, there's one\n\nor two idiots in there, you know, not,\n\nI'm not even talking about people I disagree with,\n\nbut people who just say stupid stuff, right?\n\nHateful stuff.\n\nIt's so de minimus\n\nthat the engagement is amazing.\n\nAnd I think that's why it's growing.\n\nAnd you even saw the New York Times come on there\n\nand someone told me they referenced one\n\nof their posts on Blue Sky as,\n\nand where in the past they would do that on Twitter,\n\nyou know, and to see them move over\n\nto escape what's going on over there is great.\n\nAnd here they are, I don't know their latest numbers,\n\nbut they have more than 22 million users.\n\nAnd I can tell.\n\nI think we're gonna get update on those\n\nnumbers shortly actually.\n\nJay coming on stage.\n\nJay comes on.\n\nBut you gotta try it.\n\nAnd like I said, I'm MCuban, try it.\n\nI mean, bring your friends on there.\n\nIt is truly a social network.\n\nHey, was that the Mavs game?\n\nDa da da, I was there to, I mean, that's insane, to be able\n\nto have that conversation on a social network.\n\nI think that there was, there's been this idea\n\nfor a long time, and certainly I think probably when you\n\nwere starting out as an in internet entrepreneur, that\n\nthe internet was a little bit downstream from culture.\n\nAnd now we've come around to this idea\n\nthat the internet is culture.\n\nAnd we certainly saw that play out a lot\n\nin this election too.\n\nAnd there were some reactions, responses\n\nto the outcome of this election is saying that, well,\n\nthe on the left people don't have the same kind of audience\n\nthat people are gaining on the right, right?\n\nLike, there's no podcast for the left.\n\nThat was something that.\n\nYeah, I don't agree with that at all.\n\nSo yeah, so talk about this like,\n\nbecause if everyone who just doesn't like Twitter anymore,\n\nmoves to Blue Sky\n\nor moves to Threads or moves to something like it,\n\nbut Twitter remains while small, relatively in numbers\n\nto some social networks, but sort of outsize influence\n\notherwise.\n\nI don't think Twitter.\n\nI mean, if you want to know what Elon thinks,\n\nTwitter's amazing and that's great, right?\n\nThat's his platform.\n\nSo how do we distinguish reality?\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nHow do we distinguish reality then on social media?\n\nI mean, what's really happening?\n\nI've been on Theo Von, I've been on The Nelk Boys,\n\nI've been on all those podcasts and everything,\n\nbut Joe Rogan, he won't have me on for whatever reason.\n\nAnd so when you go on there,\n\nthey just want to have a conversation.\n\nAnd from that conversation, there's a ton of clips.\n\nLike Andrew Schultz, I had a great conversation with him.\n\nThey're still posting clips, right?\n\nAnd so when you go on those, it's not that they're right\n\nor left, it's that they create clips\n\nthat feed the algorithm on Twitter.\n\nAnd so if you happen to, you know, be a fan of theirs\n\nand comparable things, the algorithm's gonna find you,\n\nyou know, the algorithm always finds you with things\n\nthat you've shown interest in.\n\nAnd so that's great.\n\nBut the way to deal with that isn't in trying\n\nto get more Andrew Schultz's, you know, to conjure that,\n\nthe way to deal with that is to flood the zone.\n\nYou know?\n\n[Host] What does that mean?\n\nWhat does that look like?\n\nWhat that means is either going\n\nand going, making the rounds\n\nand, you know, creating things that are,\n\nthat are worth talking about or worth showing,\n\nor just create memes left\n\nand right so that it just dominates the algorithms.\n\nSo like I told the Harris campaign\n\nand you know, they really didn't pursue it.\n\nYou have to, I had a conversation with Mr. Beast\n\nthat was illuminating to no end.\n\nAnd he basically said, he said, spends millions\n\nof dollars reverse engineering the algorithms\n\non each platform.\n\nAnd that's where he comes up with the ideas on\n\nwhat to do next.\n\nAnd that's exactly\n\nwhat the next political campaign has got to do.\n\nYou've got to figure out what you know, for each type\n\nof individual that you want to get to vote for you\n\nthat you want to engage.\n\nYou have to figure out their algorithm,\n\n'cause each one of us in this room has our own algorithm on\n\nTwitter that, you know, it's effectively customized\n\nfor us on Twitter, Instagram, et cetera.\n\nAnd so you have to flood the zone with\n\nas many different memes, clips, everything that you can do.\n\nSo there's something for everybody.\n\nAnd you had, there's so much volume you can't miss it.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with the right or left.\n\nI mean, like I told 'em, it could be,\n\nit's not like it was facts\n\nthat made the difference in this election, right?\n\nYou know, they're eating cats\n\nand dogs, you know, he's fucking a couch.\n\nYou know, that's what they needed more of,\n\nmore couch fucking stuff for real right?\n\nBecause if there would've been\n\n600 million couch fucking extensions,\n\neverybody would've seen it continuously\n\nbecause the memes don't filter out, right?\n\nThe algorithms don't filter out, right?\n\nThey filter forward.\n\nAnd that's politics going forward.\n\nAnd you really do think\n\nthat would've altered the outcome of the election?\n\nI think if you would, it would've made\n\nall the difference in the world.\n\nBut because when there's,\n\nbecause when Donald Trump would talk about their\n\neating cats and dogs, everybody had to cover it.\n\nAnd it turned into a meme, even though it started\n\nas one person posting one thing on Facebook when they\n\nstarted talking about weird at the beginning,\n\nwhen they talk about Brat, when they talk about\n\nfucking the couch, it was everywhere.\n\nAnd everybody had to respond to it.\n\nYou have to flood the zone.\n\nThey started Kamala's campaign,\n\nstarted off flooding the zone with stuff,\n\nand then dropped it\n\nand tried to be, you know, tried to use accuracy\n\nas a differentiator.\n\nWhereas, you know, Donald Trump's,\n\nhe floods the zone continuously.\n\nThat's what he does.\n\nThat's who he is as a campaigner.\n\nHe's a great salesperson.\n\nHe's willing to put himself in just all kinds\n\nof crazy situations and flood the zone with information.\n\nAnd it got to the point in my mind, at the end of the day,\n\nit was, who do you trust more?\n\nFor the things that they scared\n\nthat you were scared most about?\n\nWere you scared most about tariffs?\n\nWere you scared most about people eating cats and dogs?\n\nYou know, were you scared most about taxes?\n\nWere you scared most about immigration and the border?\n\nAnd they scared you and then they flooded\n\nthe zone with memes.\n\nAnd that's, to me what that and partially crypto.\n\nWe're out of time.\n\nBut I do have to ask you one more question.\n\nI want to leave the audience with a note of hope, optimism\n\nin somewhat politically volatile, unstable times.\n\nI hate saying that in these times, in this moment.\n\nHow, what would you say to people?\n\nWhat's a piece of advice you have to give to people\n\nfor navigating that, for living their lives?\n\nLook, you guys are here for a reason.\n\nYou're here because you believe in something better.\n\nYou believe in something bigger, in this country\n\nthat we are the one country in the world\n\nwhere when you have an idea\n\nand you get that feeling in your stomach,\n\nyou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\nAnd then you say to a friend, oh, I got this idea.\n\nWhat do you think Lauren?\n\nAnd Lauren goes, oh, that's really cool.\n\nAnd then you go and Google it.\n\nOr now you put it into ChatGPT, or Gemini or whatever,\n\nand it gives you a business plan\n\nand go, oh my God, I can do this.\n\nWhat makes us different is we go out there and do it.\n\nThat's who we are as a country.\n\nWe may be in weird times right now politically,\n\nbut that doesn't change who we are as Americans,\n\nthe President, you know, we can be afraid\n\nand we can be aware and we can be concerned.\n\nBut what you do\n\nand who you are, that's what makes us different.\n\nAnd so I am bullish on the United States of America,\n\nno doubt about it because that's why people are here.\n\nIt's not like people aren't showing up.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nYou know, it's not like people aren't coming\n\nto this Wired conference.\n\nIt's not like, you know,\n\nthere aren't great interviews up here.\n\nIt's not like people are saying, oh we're\n\nfucked let's just go sleep, right?\n\nNo, people are doing what we do\n\nand that's what makes us unique.\n\nIf you look at every single new technology over the last,\n\nwe talked about this, so over the last 30 years, 95%\n\nof them have come here.\n\nMaybe they were born somewhere else, but they're here.\n\nAnd the companies were born here or grown here\n\nbecause that's what we do.\n\nWho the fuck else does that?\n\nWe do as Americans.\n\nAnd that's not going to change\n\nno matter who the president is.\n\nSounds like a stump speech.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nMark, unfortunately, that's all the time we have.\n\nI'd love to keep talking.\n\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nThanks for having me, Laura.\n\nIt's really great.\n\nIt's really great hearing from you.\n\n[audience applauding]\n\nAll right.",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Dr. Orna Goralnik,\n\npsychologist and psychoanalyst.\n\nI'm here to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Couples Therapy Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHi, sweetie.\n\nAll right, Level-Studio says,\n\n'You shouldn't have to change\n\nfor your partner' is an extremely silly oversimplification.\n\nI agree that it's a silly oversimplification,\n\nbut there is some wisdom in it.\n\nWhen people come to therapy\n\nto see a couple's therapist,\n\ntheir hidden agenda is,\n\nHere's my partner,\n\nhelp me change them.\n\nAnd one of the main things I have\n\nto do in couples therapy is kind of reverse\n\nthat assumption that really what needs\n\nto happen is your partner needs to change\n\nbecause that is not how it works.\n\nFor couples to live well together,\n\neach person needs to take responsibility for themselves\n\nand see what they can change within themselves\n\nand how can they learn to accept\n\nand love their partner for who they are.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that we don't adjust\n\nand take seriously how we impact our partner,\n\nbut that is different from expecting your partner\n\nto truly change.\n\nDepresso_espresso asks,\n\nMy boyfriend thinks he should say\n\nwhatever hurtful thing is on his mind\n\nbecause he values the truth.\n\nWell, that is not helpful.\n\nIf you're talking in hurtful ways to your partner,\n\nthat is just not interesting, not helpful,\n\nonly damaging.\n\nThe truth is not everything\n\nthat comes to your mind.\n\nThe truth is what is constructive to the relationship.\n\nMutiny34 is asking,\n\nReddit, if you have to ask yourself\n\nif you love your partner,\n\ndoes that mean you don't?\n\nNo, that doesn't mean you don't.\n\nPeople's feelings are something that comes and goes\n\nand changes all the time depending on the external\n\nand internal weather,\n\ndepending on things that are happening around us,\n\nwhether it's in the relationship\n\nor outside in the world.\n\nSo the way we feel changes all the time.\n\nEven though there might be a very steady undercurrent\n\nof love,\n\nthe way you feel from moment to moment\n\nor day to day can change\n\nand sometimes you can lose touch with parts of yourself.\n\nAnd those are moments when you might ask yourself,\n\nwait, what's happening here?\n\nHow do I feel?\n\nAnd that's normal.\n\nDearSchenelle exclaims,\n\nMy boyfriend can't have female friends!\n\nDon't care.\n\nControlling your partner is\n\nprobably not gonna be a good recipe\n\nfor a solid relationship\n\nand for a mutually respectful relationship.\n\nYou want people to be happy.\n\nYou want them to have like rich and full lives.\n\nAnd if your relationship is based\n\non limiting your partner's experience in the world,\n\nthat is gonna eventually kill the relationship.\n\nZanefoxxo asks,\n\nHow do you know your partner is the one?\n\nI don't know if there is the one.\n\nI don't know.\n\nIt depends on what your philosophy of life is.\n\nWhen do you decide\n\nto really commit yourself to another person?\n\nDepends on many things.\n\nI don't know what it means really to be the one,\n\nbut if you are in a relationship in which you're growing\n\nand thriving and feeling a lot of love\n\nand respect for your partner,\n\nthat sounds pretty good.\n\nI think people carry\n\nwithin them a lot of intense fantasies\n\nthat sometimes get in the way of being in reality.\n\nIf you're in a good relationship\n\nand you are thriving,\n\nyour life is getting better,\n\nand you're full of love,\n\nthat sounds pretty good.\n\nkolejo_anu asks,\n\nWhat do you all do when your partner needs space\n\nand you crave closeness?\n\nThat is actually almost the most common dynamic\n\nthat gets formed in a relationship.\n\nAnd sometimes people can take turns\n\nin terms of who's the one that wants\n\nand who's the one that retreats.\n\nI sometimes think of it as a hair dryer kind\n\nof chasing a paper bag.\n\nThere's always some dynamic of push and pull.\n\nAnd what do you do about it?\n\nFirst of all,\n\naccept that that's a common dynamic.\n\nIf you use the metaphor of the hairdryer,\n\nyou might realize that sometimes the more you push,\n\nthe more the other person will need to retreat.\n\nSo sometimes it's a good idea\n\nto paradoxically turn things around.\n\nAnd when you realize that someone needs space,\n\nmove back, lean back,\n\ntake your own space,\n\ntake care of yourself,\n\ndo what you need.\n\nAnd then when it's time,\n\nyou'll both come back together.\n\nseppe_the-stud is asking,\n\nIs it just me\n\nor does couple therapy sound fun?\n\nLike I'm just allowed to talk [short beep]\n\nto my significant other like they ain't sitting\n\nright next to me.\n\nOkay.\n\nI do think couples therapy can be fun,\n\nobviously that's what I do.\n\nI don't think couples therapy is talking [short beep]\n\nabout your significant others.\n\nThat's not a good use of the therapeutic space,\n\nbut it's a good chance to talk about things\n\nthat it feels too risky\n\nto talk about when you're on your own.\n\nAnd what you learn\n\nin couples therapy is how to create space\n\nfor a more risk taking, dynamic,\n\ninteresting conversation\n\nthat eventually you'll be able to take home\n\nand you won't need your couples therapist for.\n\nA Reddit user asks,\n\nIs the inner child real or just therapy jargon?\n\nIt's definitely therapy jargon,\n\nbut it's also a real thing in the sense\n\nthat we all carry within us our childhood\n\nand memories of what it was like to be a child.\n\nAnd we still have needs\n\nand feelings that pertain to that part of ourselves.\n\nNow, some people continuously grow from their inner child\n\nand keep evolving and evolving and evolving,\n\nand some people live in a more fragmented\n\nor dissociated way.\n\nI'm not saying this is a pathological way of being.\n\nIt's just we're different that way.\n\nAnd some people really do keep within themselves a part\n\nthat really is like an inner child,\n\na part of themselves that hasn't necessarily developed\n\nand that they regress to\n\nor turn to under certain situations.\n\nAnd then they really feel inside like a child.\n\nBut I think it's important for us\n\nwhen we love another person to actually tune in\n\nand to see that all of us still have childish,\n\nvulnerable, needy, small parts\n\nthat are worth paying attention to.\n\nKtSaidIt asks,\n\nAre couples therapists not allowed\n\nto tell their clients to break up?\n\nIt's not that we're not allowed as couples therapists\n\nto tell people to break up.\n\nI'm sure plenty of couples therapists do say to people,\n\nMaybe it's time to break up.\n\nI tend to be kind of indeed an optimist and a romantic.\n\nMost of the time,\n\nI like to support couples in their attempt\n\nto find each other,\n\nand I don't really see my job\n\nas to tell people how to live their lives.\n\nI assume if they're coming to see me,\n\nthey want to figure out a way to make things work.\n\nAnd it might be really challenging\n\nand that's a good challenge to face\n\nbecause the challenge in a relationship is\n\nto find a way to accept and know your partner\n\nand take them as they are\n\nand address what is coming up in you\n\nthat is getting in the way.\n\nwasthischeating asks,\n\nLast night, I thought of another man\n\nwhile having sex with my husband.\n\nShould I tell him?\n\nThere's no one answer to that.\n\nI mean, one's fantasy life is generally\n\none's private experience\n\nand you don't owe it to anyone.\n\nBut for some people in relationships,\n\nit's actually exciting\n\nand a fun thing to know about what's going on\n\nin your partner's fantasy life.\n\nAnd for some people,\n\nit's too threatening.\n\nSo depends on your partner.\n\nTiam_2me is asking,\n\nSuccessful couples don't fight less than other couples,\n\nthey fight better.\n\nThat's a quote from John Gottman\n\nand Julie Schwartz Gottman.\n\nOh, have done a lot of research on couples work.\n\nI agree with that statement.\n\nNot disagreeing\n\nor not fighting is not a realistic possibility\n\nbetween two people that are obviously different\n\n'cause you're two people,\n\nso you're not gonna see the same way,\n\nyou're not gonna need the same things,\n\nyou're gonna disagree on things,\n\nbut then what happens when you disagree?\n\nCouples form a certain kind\n\nof political system between them.\n\nSo are you an autocratic political system?\n\nDo you try to control each other\n\nor do you try a democratic way of negotiating difference?\n\nListen well to each other.\n\nFigure out how to compromise.\n\nFigure out how to take turns.\n\nFighting well is an art.\n\nBipolarMindAtNotEase asks,\n\nDo men not realize\n\nthat only showing affection\n\nwhen they want sex makes us disinclined\n\nto physical touch?\n\nYeah, that is a pretty common thing\n\nthat women complain about.\n\nI think one of the issues here is that certain men,\n\nand this is luckily changing\n\nwith the younger generation,\n\nsometimes do not really know\n\nhow to establish a feeling\n\nof connection, and affection,\n\nand warmth when it's not sexual.\n\nMeaning they have sex as one\n\nof their only languages to actually feel close\n\nto another person,\n\nwhich can be off-puting to a woman\n\nwho has other ways of feeling affection and connection.\n\nPart of the work is to expand the vocabulary\n\nof what the man learns how to do in a way model\n\nand teach what it means\n\nto be affectionate when it doesn't immediately equal sex.\n\nsauvageonautopilot asks,\n\nFor those with homophobic parents,\n\nhow do I do it?\n\nTough.\n\nDepends how deep it goes.\n\nI mean, some people are homophobic\n\nbecause of just lack of knowledge\n\nand not enough experience in the world.\n\nThat can be a pretty thin layer of homophobia\n\nthat with enough patience and time,\n\nit's easy to break through.\n\nWhen homophobia is deep-seated\n\nand steeped in like a certain kind of fear and bigotry,\n\nI think part of it is patience\n\nand part of it is developing really good boundaries\n\nand not letting the homophobic parent poison your life.\n\nA Reddit user asks,\n\nIs it common to just listen\n\nto your client and provide no insight?\n\nYes.\n\nListening and helping a client understand\n\nwhat they're going through often involves spending\n\na lot of time quiet,\n\nopening space for a person\n\nto listen to their own thoughts.\n\nIf you notice,\n\nmost of the time,\n\nwhen people offer each other advice or insight,\n\nit's kind of useless.\n\nIt's rare for us to be able to offer something\n\nthat is really helpful to another person\n\nand it's better to be quiet.\n\nMikeBane asks, If all feelings are valid,\n\nthen does validation essentially lose all meaning?\n\nNo.\n\nValidation is often a very good thing\n\nto offer another person.\n\nPeople have a deep need to feel understood.\n\nLocal-Bit asks,\n\nIs the truth more important than people's feelings?\n\nIn relationships, no.\n\nThey both matter.\n\nSo the truth will be useless\n\nif a person is too upset\n\nor too hurt to deal with the truth.\n\nSo in a conversation or in a relationship,\n\npeople's feelings are the pre-requirement\n\nto dealing with the truth,\n\nwhich is of course very important.\n\nWhen I say that the truth is important,\n\nI mean the truth of the matter,\n\nlike the thing that really matters.\n\nI don't mean that facts are important,\n\nbut sometimes people argue\n\nor talk about facts when they're really trying to get\n\nto the truth of what matters to them.\n\nAnd in that sense,\n\nthe truth matters a lot.\n\nRebelliousMindBox asks,\n\nWhat to look for in couples therapist?\n\nI think, first of all,\n\nto look for someone who you feel comfortable talking to,\n\nsomeone who you feel like is wise\n\nin a way that matters to you,\n\nsomeone that makes both of you feel comfortable\n\nand not like their siding with one or the other,\n\nand someone who is not closed-minded\n\nor biased in any direction.\n\nYou want someone who's open.\n\nUnited_Biscotti_4402 asks,\n\nWhat's a sign\n\nthat tells you a couple's relationship will not last?\n\nWell, first of all,\n\nI'm not necessarily in the business\n\nof predicting what people are gonna do\n\nand what's gonna happen\n\nbecause people surprise me all the time,\n\nbut there are signs that alarm me\n\nthat make me feel like,\n\nOoh, something is not going well for these people.\n\nFirst of all,\n\nwhen the kind of goodwill\n\nand curiosity about each other has evaporated\n\nfor a long time\n\nand all that's left could be a certain kind\n\nof disdain or contempt,\n\nwhich will kill the relationship.\n\nSometimes couples get stuck in patterns\n\nthat feel almost addictive\n\nof like abuse or mutual put down.\n\nAnd when I realized that I can't convince the couple\n\nto move out of that stage or out of that mode,\n\nthen I think the relationship is doomed.\n\nNational_Mouse asks,\n\nI am no longer in love with my husband\n\nand do not know how to get back there.\n\nThat is a painful place to be.\n\nSometimes people go through phases\n\nin their relationship\n\nwhere they lose touch with their love\n\nor the relationship is changing in a way\n\nthat the old love is no longer relevant.\n\nPeople are moving towards a new chapter\n\nin their relationship.\n\nAnd they may need to be patient\n\nand wait for this kind of new feeling to surface,\n\nbut sometimes the relationship really is dying\n\nat least for one person,\n\nand then it's a painful process\n\nof starting to say goodbye.\n\nburninego is asking,\n\nIf trust is lost in a relationship,\n\nhow do you gain it back\n\nto show your partner you're worth trusting?\n\nIt's a great question.\n\nTrust is not something that you can earn\n\nby demanding it or forcing it.\n\nTrust is something that one experiences over time.\n\nAnd if trust is broken,\n\nwhat needs to happen is that over time,\n\nthe couple needs to be convinced\n\nthat they're in a new and different place.\n\nAnd sometimes it takes a long time,\n\na long time of consistent trustworthy behavior\n\nthat registers with the other person\n\nand as a couple as the new reality of their relationship.\n\nSo, patience.\n\nIntuitivempress asks,\n\nWhy do people think when they get in relationships,\n\nthey stop learning and studying their partner?\n\nLOL, people grow, change,\n\nand evolve all the time.\n\nOne of the things that happens in relationship is\n\nthat our perception of our partner can get fixed.\n\nAnd while our partner is growing,\n\nwe don't really wanna see it.\n\nThere's something about it that might be threatening\n\nor alarming to us\n\nand that's when the relationship starts freezing.\n\nBut, yes, people are changing\n\nand growing all the time.\n\nNot to mention that we are governed to some degree\n\nby our unconscious,\n\nwhich keeps sending us all sorts\n\nof unpredictable messages\n\nthat will change the scene anyhow.\n\nSo, yes, change growth is happening all the time.\n\nJosleeky asks,\n\nWhat do you do\n\nif your family member doesn't like your partner?\n\nNot an unusual scenario,\n\nand it's not an unusual scenario,\n\nnot necessarily\n\nbecause family members specifically don't like partners,\n\nbut when you form a couple,\n\nyou're forming a kind of a new unit\n\nand the family of origin around\n\nthat unit needs to rearrange itself.\n\nAnd that's not necessarily a comfortable rearrangement.\n\nSo people will resist the intrusion\n\nof someone new into the family system\n\nand that is a challenge for the couple\n\nto establish their own boundaries.\n\nI think if the relationship is important to you,\n\nyou try to really create a good boundary\n\naround your couplehood\n\nand make the other family members secondary\n\nto your couplehood.\n\nmugglecatlady asks,\n\nAm I unfair?\n\n37, male boyfriend hates cleaning.\n\nShould I charge higher rent?\n\nOh, it's a funny way to phrase a question,\n\nbut generally I think it's a good idea for couples\n\nto have a fair arrangement between them\n\nand something that feels fair to both of them.\n\nNow, that's often a very difficult question\n\nbecause some people,\n\nactually, most people view their own work as more\n\nof a contribution than their partners.\n\nIf a grown man doesn't like cleaning,\n\nit would be good to ask the grown man,\n\nWhat would you wanna do instead\n\nas your contribution to the relationship?\n\nAnd it would be a good conversation to have.\n\nhappilyordinary asks,\n\nHow do I get over my husband cheating on me?\n\nComplicated question.\n\nThere's no one answer to that question.\n\nIt obviously depends on what happened.\n\nWhat was the cheating about?\n\nWas the cheating in response\n\nto something that's going on in the relationship,\n\nsomething that you can work through in the relationship?\n\nWas the cheating a habit\n\nthat someone brings into the relationship?\n\nHard for them to be honest,\n\nhard for them to be steady.\n\nSome cheating can be completely unrelated\n\nto the relationship.\n\nBut just like establishing trust is something\n\nthat takes time.\n\nGetting over cheating is something that takes time\n\nand manifests in consistent behavior.\n\ndebrisaway asks,\n\nHas anyone broke their family's multi-generational\n\ncodependency trait?\n\nYes, plenty of people have.\n\nThe passing on of multigenerational habits,\n\nbeliefs, ideologies, and problems is very common.\n\nWe all come into relationships with our own past\n\nand with our family's past.\n\nWe all carry within us a legacy\n\nof how to be in a relationship,\n\nwhat to expect of a relationship.\n\nI can think of a recent couple that I worked with\n\nwhere the wife was talking about\n\nhow every woman across the generations\n\nbefore her divorced a failing husband,\n\nfailing to thrive husband.\n\nAnd she was married to a lovely man.\n\nAnd she was like,\n\nI don't know how I break this cycle.\n\nHow do I not assume\n\nthat history is just gonna repeat itself?\n\nSo yes, it's a common thing to do\n\nto be influenced by past generations\n\nand it's a good challenge to have to do better.\n\nsarvam-sarvatmakam asks,\n\nHow exactly does psychoanalysis help the patient?\n\nIf I had to quickly summarize the main tenets\n\nof how psychoanalysis helps,\n\nand I think it's a very powerful and wonderful mode.\n\nIt is, first of all,\n\nin helping us become acquainted with our unconscious\n\nwith things that we're not aware of that drive us.\n\nAnd the second is to understand that\n\nwhat happens early in our history has a powerful impact\n\non what's happening now in our lives.\n\nAnd once we learn what we're bringing in from our history,\n\nour own history, multi-generational history,\n\nwe can become freer of it.\n\nchipotlelover says,\n\nI'm in an intercultural relationship\n\nand sometimes it can be so hard.\n\nPlease, any positive anecdotes, experiences,\n\nor words of wisdom would be appreciated.\n\nYeah, first of all,\n\nwe're living in a world\n\nwhere intercultural relationships are more and more common.\n\nI think intercultural relationships\n\nin a way manifest a more extreme version\n\nof what it means to be in a relationship in general,\n\nwhich is that you're in a relationship with someone\n\nwho is different from you By definition.\n\nI find intercultural relationships particularly interesting\n\nin the sense that what you see\n\nin a much more explicit way is\n\nhow culture shapes the private experience.\n\nIt's always true.\n\nWe all come from a part particular legacy\n\nand a particular culture.\n\nWe all carry within us different ideologies,\n\ndifferent class systems.\n\nI mean, in a way,\n\nevery couple is an intercultural couple.\n\nBut when it's much more explicit,\n\nI find that it forces people to really tackle\n\nand be aware how culture kind of really shapes us.\n\nAnd the work that couples do\n\nwhen they're in intercultural relationships is\n\npretty profound work.\n\nOkay, megannflores is asking,\n\nHow do you know it's the right time\n\nto leave a relationship?\n\nIt really depends\n\nif the reason you're leaving a relationship is\n\nbecause of the how you are feeling\n\nor because of something that's happening.\n\nIf you're asking yourself,\n\nhow do I know that I'm ready to leave a relationship?\n\nThen you check in with yourself.\n\nAre you still curious about your partner?\n\nIs there still goodwill that you're generating?\n\nOr do you feel kind of like dead inside,\n\nlike you lost the livelihood of your feelings?\n\nNow, if you are wondering\n\nabout whether whatever's going on\n\nin the relationship is time to leave,\n\nthat's a different question.\n\nIs the relationship feeling too toxic?\n\nIs it feeling like you are trying and trying and trying\n\nand nothing is changing?\n\nDo you feel like the relationship has sort\n\nof reached a dead end?\n\nThen it's time to go.\n\nErrorGlobal asks,\n\nI think I have to leave,\n\nbut I can't bring myself to do it.\n\nHow do you build emotional strength to leave?\n\nHow do you build the emotional strength?\n\nI think part of it is finding this sense\n\nof truth inside yourself,\n\nkind of knowing that that's the right thing to do,\n\nand being both brave\n\nand caring enough about your partner to do it well.\n\nMeaning to do it with care for the other person,\n\nfor yourself and with respect for the relationship.\n\nTombul-Kus asks,\n\nHusband, 37, male was upset I,\n\n33, female, guided him during sex.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how to interpret this,\n\nbut what was upsetting about that interaction?\n\nIf we're talking about a man that doesn't want feedback,\n\nthat's an issue.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhat's the purpose of having sex\n\nif you're not communicating about what each other want?\n\nBut if we're talking about someone who gives feedback\n\nin a way that is critical or humiliating,\n\nthen that's good to know.\n\nDepends how you give each other feedback.\n\nPeople are very vulnerable\n\nwhen they're sexual with each other,\n\nand they want to be treated with care and respect.\n\nMeeshCapisci asks,\n\nWhy is it when you're in a stable,\n\nfulfilling relationship,\n\npeople want you to ruin it with marriage or kids?\n\nCouples often find that\n\neven when they're in a very content space,\n\nthere's always this kind of drive\n\nto take it further, to go further.\n\nAnd one of the ways that marriage\n\nand kids introduce this further\n\nand more into a relationship is that marriage,\n\nto some degree,\n\nmeans you are forming a certain kind\n\nof contract with your community.\n\nSo you're extending what you're doing\n\nwith your relationship beyond yourself,\n\nand often you do that so that you're creating a space\n\nto raise kids.\n\nAnd for some of us,\n\nraising is an incredible experience\n\nthat expands your own\n\nand your couples' meaning in the world.\n\nIt's the option to take care of other people,\n\nwhich is, for some of us,\n\nlike the best thing that ever happens.\n\nliketearsirain asks,\n\nIs resentment a normal,\n\ninevitable part of all romantic relationships?\n\nUnfortunately, we are not perfect as humans.\n\nAnd sadly, resentment is a pretty normal thing\n\nin relationships.\n\nIt's not a great thing.\n\nPart of what people do, for example,\n\nin couples work is they figure out\n\nhow not to accumulate resentments,\n\nbut to, first of all,\n\nwork within themselves about what's bothering them\n\nbefore they dump it on someone else,\n\nand then find a way to talk\n\nin a way that you're asking for what you need\n\nor saying what's troubling you, ideally, without blame,\n\nand that's when you are less likely\n\nto develop resentments.\n\nmochajave asks,\n\nDo you always fight with your other half\n\non the same things over and over again?\n\nYes, in a way.\n\nCouples typically have one\n\nor two fights that happen in one way\n\nor another throughout their relationship.\n\nIdeally, you want that fight to evolve\n\nand change over time,\n\nbut we do tend to repeat the things that bother us\n\nand matter to us.\n\nTemporaryHeadache asks,\n\nI, 38, male,\n\naccidentally ended up tracking\n\nmy wife's, 38, female, periods\n\nand realized that my entire life revolves around her cycle.\n\nConcerned about her health\n\nand wondering if I should say something?\n\nFirst of all, let's ignore the fact\n\nthat one accidentally tracks the partner's periods.\n\nI don't know what that means.\n\nThat's not an accident.\n\nSo for example, if we talk about women's cycles,\n\nmenstrual cycles have a lot to do with hormones.\n\nSo women describe like all sorts of shifts actually.\n\nIt's not always in one or the other direction.\n\nShifts in their libido,\n\nshifts in how they feel within their body,\n\nor shifts in mood and irritability,\n\nshifts in how tuned in they are\n\nto their partner depending on moods.\n\nThe other interesting things about these cycles is\n\nthat the pheromones change\n\nand people who are really tuned into each other,\n\nlike the partner's desire\n\nand level of libido can change based on the woman's cycles.\n\nAll of these biological aspects\n\nof our lives have a very powerful subliminal impact\n\non all of us,\n\nnot just in this case, the woman.\n\nDirectMaximum asks,\n\nMy wife always puts the kids first\n\nand rarely pays attention to me anymore,\n\nand I feel unloved.\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nThat's not an unusual thing\n\nto happen in a relationship when kids enter the picture.\n\nSometimes the partners need\n\nto settle into being somewhat marginalized by the kids\n\nthat do take up a lot of attention.\n\nBut sometimes this said wife might need some help\n\nto pull out of the hyperfocus on the children,\n\nand that is usually done not by way of criticism,\n\nbut by making sure she has enough help\n\nor support with the kids\n\nso that she can pull her attention away from the kids\n\nand back towards her life as a love partner.\n\nCranberryj3lly is asking,\n\nHow to address emotional regulation\n\nwhile still letting partner feel his feelings?\n\nLet me just first say\n\nthat emotional regulation is a hugely important topic\n\nbetween couples\n\nbecause there is a certain zone or realm\n\nof emotionality within which we function well as people.\n\nSo when people are too shut down, or too excited,\n\nor too angry,\n\nthey can't really listen to each other\n\nand they can't really take in information\n\nand they can't talk properly.\n\nAnd how to find a way that you feel comfortable\n\nwith each other is the ongoing art\n\nand dance of being in a couple.\n\nWe learn about our partner slowly and gradually.\n\nWhat helps them regulate themselves?\n\nAre there things that you do\n\nor say that are too triggering for your partner\n\nand not conducive to a good conversation?\n\nAre there ways that you can, in your own behavior,\n\nhelp your interactions be more contained?\n\nAnd then you have to ask your partner to be responsible\n\nfor their own level of excitation\n\nand their own regulation.\n\nDownandded asks,\n\nWhy would a woman never really initiate sex\n\nbut says it's amazing\n\nand she seems to overtly enjoy it?\n\nThere are many ways to think about this question.\n\nI mean, one is in traditional ways\n\nthat men and women are raised,\n\nwomen are not supposed to initiate sex.\n\nThey're not supposed to even want it.\n\nIt's shameful.\n\nThat's an old style way of gendering sexuality.\n\nAnd then there's the question\n\nof like individual preferences.\n\nSome people are just less inclined to initiate.\n\nThey want to be pursued.\n\nThey wanna be found.\n\nAnd that's kind of their sexual orientation.\n\nThat doesn't mean anything about liking sex.\n\nIt just means that's their orientation.\n\nNow that doesn't mean that it doesn't change.\n\nYou can talk about it,\n\nand you can see what works for the person,\n\nbut it's not an alarming sign.\n\nshorshimon asks,\n\nMy boyfriend,\n\n26, male, distorts/changes the story\n\nabout bad things that happened to him\n\nand I, 26, female, can't take it.\n\nWell, there are many reasons why people distort things\n\nor change things.\n\nI mean, some of it might be actual conscious\n\nbecause they might feel shame,\n\nor they might feel embarrassed,\n\nor they wish things were different or better.\n\nBut then people constantly distort their own histories\n\nand their own stories\n\nbecause of defenses,\n\nbecause they're uncomfortable with things,\n\nand they have different take on reality\n\nthan what other people see.\n\nMost of the time,\n\nthe facts of the story are not really what's interesting.\n\nSo arguing about facts\n\nor distorting facts is somewhat of a waste of time\n\nbecause what's interesting is what matters\n\nto each person about the story they're telling.\n\nSo if someone is distorting a story,\n\nwhat might be interesting is not arguing\n\nabout the fact of what happened,\n\nbut how does this person experience\n\nthe story they're talking about?\n\nOkay, that's it.\n\nThose are all the questions.\n\nHope you learn something and see you next time.",

Dan Beaulieu asks,\n\nWhy are we still calling the Cowboys America's team?\n\nReally, this is a fair question.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have a great history.\n\nThey've won Super Bowls, they've had tons of playoff teams,\n\na great tradition,\n\nbut the last time they won the Super Bowl was in the early\n\n1990s, and so we are going back a long way\n\nand they haven't won many playoff games since then.\n\nThey still have probably more fans than any other team.\n\nThey get tremendous television ratings,\n\nbut I don't know that they're America's team anymore.\n\nNewRedditor says,\n\nToday I learned one of the four kickers\n\nwho have kicked 63 yard field goals in NFL history\n\nwas Tom Dempsey for the Saints.\n\nHe had no toes on his kicking foot.\n\nYes, he'd been born with no toes on his right foot.\n\nHe'd been born with no fingers.\n\nOn one hand he was a great athlete and he made it to the NFL\n\nand he kicked with a square toed shoe.\n\nNo other kicker had come close\n\nto making a field goal from 63 yards, and it won a game.\n\nIt shocked everyone.\n\nAnd what was interesting was in the immediate aftermath\n\nof that, in the off season,\n\nthe league outlawed the square toed shoe that he had used\n\nbecause they felt it was almost like a club kicking the ball\n\nand was an unfair advantage.\n\nThe great thing for Dempsey was he continued\n\nto kick in the NFL for a number of years.\n\nThe changing of the shoe did not limit his ability\n\nto have a football career.\n\nBarry Schuck asks,\n\nWhat is the origin of the term touchdown?\n\nThis goes back to the beginning of football in this country.\n\nOne of the main influences was rugby.\n\nAnd in rugby, the goal is to move the ball over a goal line\n\nand you score the point when the offensive player touches\n\nthe ball down on the ground in the end zone.\n\nThat's called a try in rugby,\n\nbut the you touch down is what the player is trying to do.\n\nAnd so football borrowed a lot from rugby in its early\n\nyears, and so it was the same thing.\n\nThey felt like,\n\nwell, we're gonna get the ball over the goal line,\n\nand we're gonna score the points.\n\nHFNYBielaski asks, I hate the new kickoff rule in the NFL.\n\nWhy do they feel they must make new rules?\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the new kickoff rule either,\n\nbut I do know why they did it.\n\nThey're trying to cut down on the velocity of the collisions\n\nand keep the players safer.\n\nSo what they did was they moved the coverage teams forward\n\nabout 40 yards well into enemy territory.\n\nThe kicker is alone back on his 40, kicking the ball off.\n\nThe coverage team can't begin to run\n\nuntil the ball is caught\n\nand the returner begins to return the kick,\n\nso the velocity of the collisions is cut way down.\n\nThe New Mule asks,\n\nBy the way, are NFL footballs still made of pig skin?\n\nNFL footballs are not made of pig skin\n\nand they've never been made of pig skin.\n\nThe exterior has always been leather.\n\nThe way that the nickname pig skin came\n\nabout was in the early days of the NFL,\n\nthe 1920s, the 1930s, to inflate the balls.\n\nThey used pig's bladder,\n\nand so the nickname grew from pig's bladder to pig skin.\n\nIt never was the skin, it was always leather.\n\nHowever, the fact that there was pig in trails in the ball\n\nand it was known as pig skin,\n\nand still sometimes you hear people call it pig skin.\n\nSurvirianism asks,\n\nWhat have been the most impactful rule changes\n\nin NFL history?\n\nUnlimited substitutions.\n\nThat rule came into existence in 1950.\n\nBefore that, there were great limits on when players\n\ncould come off the field.\n\nAs a result, you had guys playing both ways.\n\nIf you were the quarterback, you were also a defensive back.\n\nIf you were an offensive lineman,\n\nyou were also a defensive lineman.\n\nWhen the NFL went to unlimited substitutions in 1950,\n\ncompletely changed the nature of the game.\n\nIt brought in specialization.\n\nYou could just be a defensive back\n\nor you could be a tied end,\n\nand so what that really created was separate units as well.\n\nOffense and defense.\n\nKhutso Junior asked who invented football.\n\nFootball was not invented by one person.\n\nThe field sport came over from England around 1850, 1860.\n\nThe first official game was a college game between Rutgers\n\nand Princeton in 1869,\n\nbut it bore no resemblance to the sport that you see today.\n\nIt was really a mixture of rugby and soccer.\n\nIt became the sport that we know it much more.\n\nSo about 10\n\nor 12 years later, Walter Camp,\n\nwho was a medical student at Yale,\n\nhelped invent the rules of football.\n\nIt wasn't a free flowing game anymore.\n\nIt was one team had the ball or the other team had the ball.\n\nNow you could run with the ball or throw the ball.\n\nSo around 1880, it became a semblance\n\nof the sport that we know today.\n\nOkay, Health asks,\n\nWhich team had the worst defense in NFL history?\n\nNow, I think there's a lot of fans\n\nthat could raise their hand and have a suggestion on that,\n\nbut I think the winner is the Detroit Lions\n\nof 2008.\n\nThat year, the Lions played 16 games, they lost all 16,\n\nand they gave up almost 33 points a game.\n\nNo team in the history\n\nof the NFL has allowed more than 33 points per game.\n\nOn average, the Lions came very close that year.\n\nThey have to win. Heidelburg says,\n\nChange my view, Patrick Mahomes is visibly\n\nand obviously better at the quarterback position\n\nthan Tom Brady was.\n\nYou can't knock either one of these players.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is the best quarterback\n\nof the current generation in the NFL, the most successful,\n\na fantastic player.\n\nIt's already won three Super Bowls.\n\nHe's on his way to being in the conversation.\n\nHowever, Tom Brady right now owns that conversation,\n\nand I would suggest looking at the statistics,\n\nit's really pretty simple.\n\nHe won seven Super Bowls.\n\nHe is far and away the career leader in NFL history\n\nin touchdown passes, completions, passing, yardage.\n\nNo one else is close.\n\nToolazytolink asks,\n\nBefore the forward pass was invented,\n\nwhat the hell did the quarterback do?\n\nWhat needs to be understood is that in the early days\n\nof football, the quarterback did not touch the ball\n\non every play.\n\nOffenses ran\n\nthrough the tailback was the most important position\n\non the offensive field.\n\nThe quarterback was so named\n\nbecause he was a quarter of the way back to the tailback.\n\nSame with the halfback, half the way back to the tailback\n\nand the fullback was lined up next to the tailback.\n\nThe quarterback was more of a blocker.\n\nA Reddit user asks, What made Jerry Rice, the GOAT?\n\nRice, the receiver for the San Francisco 49ERs\n\nis easily the greatest receiver in the history\n\nof pro football.\n\nHe played for 20 years.\n\nHe set, I believe 36 records, many of which still stand.\n\nHe's the all time leader in catches in receiving yardage,\n\nin receiving touchdowns.\n\nNearly 200 I believe.\n\nSo the GOAT of receivers, that's an easy one.\n\nVarious Beach 7840 asks,\n\nWhat is the greatest single game performance\n\nin NFL history?\n\nIn more recent football, I would go\n\nwith Tom Brady's performance Super Bowl 51\n\nagainst the Atlanta Falcons where they trailed 28 to three\n\nand came back to win the game 34 to 28.\n\nIn overtime, that entire comeback rested on Tom Brady's arm.\n\nHe threw and threw and threw,\n\nand he almost never missed a pass\n\nand engineered the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.\n\nA peerless performance.\n\nFake White Knight asks,\n\nWhy is Joe Namath in the Hall of Fame?\n\nJoe Namath is in the Hall of Fame\n\nbecause he was the quarterback\n\nof the New York Jets when they engineered\n\nprobably the greatest upset in pro football history.\n\nSuper Bowl III, they were heavy underdogs.\n\nThey were the champions of the AFL, the New York Jets\n\nand Namath predicted they would win the game\n\nand they did win the game.\n\nThey defeated the champions of the NFL, the Baltimore Colts.\n\nThe Colts were favored by 17 points.\n\nThe whole sports world thought they would win.\n\nIf you look at it, his statistics, his accomplishments,\n\nother than that, he really doesn't belong.\n\nHe had a losing record as a starting quarterback.\n\nHe barely completed 50% of his passes.\n\nIn today's football, if you complete barely 50%\n\nof your passes, you don't have a job.\n\nHe threw more interceptions than touchdowns over his career.\n\nHowever, his one great moment\n\nwas just about the greatest moment.\n\nStout Saber asks, In the old days,\n\nwhy the hell was the goalpost\n\nin the middle of the end zone?\n\nGoalpost was never in the middle of the end zone.\n\nIt was on the goal line.\n\nThat's where it was for a number of years, right?\n\nWhen pro football started\n\nand the reason it was there, there wasn't nearly\n\nas much scoring in the early days of pro football.\n\nIt wouldn't be unusual to see the final score\n\nof a game be six to two or nine to three.\n\nSo they were trying to encourage scoring\n\nand they were trying to encourage field goals,\n\nso they had the goalpost right on the goal line.\n\nWhat happened was.\n\nTeams started relying too much on field goals,\n\nand kicking too many field goals,\n\nso that's when they moved the goalpost to the back\n\nof the end zone, making it harder to kick field goals,\n\ntrying to encourage touchdowns.\n\nIt's also too dangerous\n\nto have the goal post right on the goal line.\n\nYou've got today's players bigger, stronger, faster,\n\nand they're crisscrossing the field at a great velocity.\n\nIf they ran into the goal post that's situated there,\n\nyou'd have serious injuries.\n\nAt Travs Michael asks,\n\nSo the undefeated Dolphins\n\nare the best football team of all time?\n\nA very good question\n\nand one that will always start an argument.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins in 1972 played 14 regular season games,\n\nthree playoff games, won them all.\n\nThe only team in NFL history to go\n\nthrough an entire season without losing a game,\n\nand so by definition, they're the greatest team of all time.\n\nOf course, football is relative.\n\nIt's a lot different today than it was back then.\n\nDifferent teams can claim\n\nthat they're better even if they might've lost a game.\n\nOne game along the way.\n\nThe Chicago Bears\n\nof 1985 had probably the most fierce defense\n\nin the history of the NFL.\n\nThey lost one game\n\nand pretty much slaughtered everybody else.\n\nThe dynasty teams in the NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers,\n\nthe San Francisco 49 ERs, the Dallas Cowboys,\n\nthey all had fantastic teams at times over the years,\n\nthey all won multiple Super Bowls.\n\nI'm sure if you said, Would you like\n\nto have them play the Miami Dolphins of 1972,\n\nthey would take that on in a heartbeat.\n\nBut the Miami Dolphins didn't lose a game that year.\n\nThey get to brag.\n\nAt Content Lawyer asks,\n\nHow has technology changed the way football\n\nis played in the NFL?\n\nThe fact that there's so much no more video in our world\n\nnow, certainly has changed pro football\n\nas it has everything else.\n\nAnytime you're watching a game,\n\nyou see players on the sidelines as soon\n\nas they come off the field,\n\nthe quarterbacks oftentimes looking at a tablet going\n\nover what they did.\n\nYou have coaches, defensive coordinators,\n\noffensive coordinators\n\nwho would rather be in the press box than down on the field\n\nbecause they have access to much more video.\n\nI would argue that technology hasn't changed, pro football\n\nas much as it has other aspects of our world.\n\nGPS technology, for instance, could easily be used\n\nto determine whether a team has gained 10 yards\n\nin four downs and gets a first down.\n\nWhen they bring those chains out for a measurement,\n\nit is still an imperfect science.\n\nThe reason why we're not seeing GPS technology in football\n\nhas never been really explained.\n\nThe NFL has a great thing going.\n\nThe simpler the better in some respects,\n\nand so I think at this point they want to just continue\n\nwith the way it was.\n\nJ Macomber 75 asks, Wait,\n\nwhen did the NFL start allowing quarterbacks\n\nto throw while running?\n\nQuarterbacks have always been able to throw while running.\n\nThere was never a limit on a quarterback's ability to run,\n\nand throw.\n\nThere were however many limits on passing the rules\n\nthat constricted passing in the early days\n\nof the NFL sound amazing today.\n\nIf the passer threw the ball\n\nand it was incomplete, that was a 15 yard penalty.\n\nIf the passer lines up\n\nand throws the ball into the end zone trying\n\nto throw a touchdown\n\nand the ball falls incomplete,\n\nthe other team gained possession of the ball.\n\nSo there were tons of rules\n\nthat restricted passing in the early days of pro football,\n\nand it all changed.\n\nIn 1933, the owners\n\nof the teams realized the sport they felt was pretty boring.\n\nIt was a lot of just plunging into the middle of the line,\n\nnot nearly enough passing.\n\nThey opened it wide and the change was instantaneous.\n\nSLOson asks, will chronic traumatic\n\nencephalopathy CTE ultimately killed the NFL,\n\nor is there simply too much money in football?\n\nThis is a great and serious question\n\nthat is on a lot of minds in the NFL.\n\nThe study of concussions\n\nand the impact\n\nof playing football on the players has been an ongoing story\n\nfor the last 15 or 20 years.\n\nThere's a lot of concern in the NFL about whether playing\n\nthe sport is too dangerous for you.\n\nA lot of the doctors and a lot of the researchers will say\n\nthat their research points to the fact that, yes,\n\nit is dangerous to play this game,\n\nso this is an ongoing situation that the NFL\n\nfor sure is worried about.\n\nThat's why you see so much thrown into improving helmet\n\ntechnology and trying\n\nto make the sports safer for the players.\n\nI don't think it will kill the NFL. The NFL is so popular.\n\nPork Spork 69 asks,\n\nWhat's the biggest single season turnaround\n\nin NFL history?\n\nThere've been a lot of losing teams\n\nthat have gone on to have winning teams immediately.\n\nI don't think you can come close to what the St. Louis Rams\n\ndid in the late 90s.\n\nIn 1998, they played 16 games.\n\nThey won four came in last in their division.\n\nThe beginning of the next year, they were listed\n\nas a 201 shot to win the Super Bowl,\n\nbut they had a new quarterback, Kurt Warner,\n\nand suddenly their offense exploded\n\nand they went all the way to the Super Bowl\n\nand they won the Super Bowl.\n\nMcRib 79 asks,\n\nWhat was the last year leather helmets\n\nwere used in the NFL?\n\nThe way to start answering that question is to understand\n\nthat into the 1940s, there were players playing\n\nwith no helmets.\n\nIt was not mandatory that you had to wear a helmet.\n\nIn 1942, a player named Dick Plasmin\n\nfor the Chicago Bears was the last NFL player to play\n\nwith no helmet.\n\nThe next year, the NFL made helmets mandatory\n\nand those were leather helmets.\n\nThin little scraps of leather didn't give you a whole lot\n\nof assistance as far as safety is concerned,\n\nand so in that decade, the technology began to advance\n\nand helmet makers rolled out the plastic helmet.\n\nBy 1950 NFL players were using plastic helmets,\n\nI Guarantee It asks,\n\nWho is Vince Lombardi\n\nand why does he have a trophy named after him?\n\nVince Lombardi was one\n\nof the greatest coaches in the history of the NFL.\n\nHe was coaching the Green Bay Packers\n\nwhen the Super Bowl era began.\n\nHe came to Green Bay in 1959.\n\nThey were the worst team in the NFL.\n\nThey didn't win a game the year before.\n\nTide won, Lombardi took the same players\n\nthat had been on that WINLESS team.\n\nThey had a winning record in his first season in 1959,\n\nand then starting in 1960, they dominated the NFL\n\nfor the next six or seven years.\n\nThey won five championships out of seven years.\n\nThey won the first two Super Bowls,\n\nand so Vince Lombardi,\n\nby winning those first two Super Bowls,\n\nreally set the standard for excellence in pro football.\n\nYo Cubo asks,\n\nWhat NFL records do you think will never be broken?\n\nA couple come to mind. George Blanda, a quarterback\n\nand kicker who played in the 50s, the 60s,\n\nand the 70s, played 26 seasons\n\nof professional football.\n\nI don't think we're ever gonna see anyone play 26 seasons\n\nof NFL Football.\n\nBrett Favre quarterback for the Green Bay Packers great Hall\n\nof Fame quarterback.\n\nStayed healthy amazingly\n\nand started 297 straight games at quarterback.\n\nThat is an Ironman record\n\nthat in football is almost impossible.\n\nThere's so many injuries, even with rules\n\nthat have made quarterbacks not getting hit\n\nas hard as they used to.\n\nThey still get hit hard. 297 straight starts.\n\nI don't think we're ever gonna see anyone come close\n\nto that.\n\nJ Garzaniti asks,\n\nWhat is the greatest football comeback of all time?\n\nNow, it depends on what you're talking about.\n\nJust a couple of years ago,\n\nthe Minnesota Vikings were playing the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Colts were ahead 33 to nothing.\n\nThe Vikings came back and won that game.\n\nThat is the greatest comeback in pro football history\n\nin terms of points,\n\nthat was a regular season game.\n\nIn a playoff game in 1992,\n\nthe Houston Oilers were ahead of the Buffalo Bills\n\nin Buffalo by 32 points, the Bills mounted a rally in front\n\nof their home fans and came back and won that game.\n\nThe biggest comeback in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe New England Patriots were playing the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nThe Falcons were ahead 28 to three, so a 25 point lead.\n\nThe Patriots came back and won that game.\n\nThose are definitely your three comebacks that stand out far\n\nand away from anything else in the history of pro football.\n\nOkay, that's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something. Until next time.\n\n[gentle music]",

You'd find them on every continent.\n\nAnd then we see this impact layer,\n\nthis ash, the fallout from the asteroid,\n\nand nowhere on Earth has anyone found\n\na single in-place dinosaur fossil\n\none centimeter above this layer.\n\nWe can see that there was a day in history when, poof,\n\nthey were gone.\n\n@Whereisbrandon writes, If asteroids killed the dinosaurs,\n\nhow come every other animal that was alive\n\nat the same time as them, that's still alive now, survived?\n\nThe biggest killer that day, when the asteroid struck,\n\nwas the heat.\n\nSo if you were on the surface of the Earth\n\nand had no place to hide, you'd die that day.\n\nIf you could get underground,\n\nlike a little shrew-like mammal, or a lizard,\n\nor crocodiles, or good burrowers, or even birds,\n\nthere were birds at the end of the Cretaceous period,\n\nif you could get under the ground that day,\n\nyou had a chance at surviving.\n\n@DaRealLemm1ng asks, Where is the asteroid\n\nthat killed the dinosaurs? Has it ever been found?\n\nIt has been found actually.\n\nAnd there's a crater off the Yucatan Peninsula,\n\nthat's the east coast of Mexico,\n\nthat's about 110 miles across and 12 miles deep.\n\nIt was published in 1991,\n\nthat's when scientists knew about it.\n\nBut, actually, petroleum companies knew about it\n\nsince the seventies and they didn't tell anyone\n\n'cause they're petroleum companies.\n\nThe asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs\n\nwas about 18 kilometers across,\n\ntraveling at about 45 times the speed of a bullet,\n\nand it probably landed in the springtime\n\nbecause there are some fish in North Dakota,\n\nsome fossil fish,\n\nthat have spring pollen trapped in their gills.\n\n@SunpaiTarku asks a good question,\n\nWhich animal species came the closest to going extinct\n\nand then successfully recovered?\n\nWell, the best example I know of is the California condor,\n\nin 1972, was down to about 22 individuals.\n\nThe chemical DDT was causing their eggshells\n\nto be soft and to break, and so they couldn't reproduce.\n\nPlus, they're scavengers,\n\nso they would eat a dead deer that had been shot by a hunter\n\nwith a lead shot, and they were getting lead poisoning.\n\nAnd so through an amazing effort,\n\nzoos and other conservation organizations,\n\nthey captured every single remaining condor, all 22.\n\nThey had an intensive breeding program\n\nand then they started to release them back into the wild.\n\nThey are not outta danger,\n\nthey are still a critically endangered species,\n\nbut right now there are about\n\n550 California condors in the world.\n\nSome of them have actually made their way from California\n\nto Zion National Park,\n\nand there's now a small breeding population\n\nof California condors there.\n\nSo they seem to be moving in the right direction\n\nbecause we took action, because we banned DDT,\n\nbecause California banned lead shots.\n\nSo it's not like we're helpless in these cases,\n\nthere are things that we can do\n\nto help pull these organisms back from the brink,\n\nbut the time to act is now.\n\n@Nomondensele asks, What's the worst that could happen\n\nif mosquitoes and flies were to be extinct?\n\nWell, although they are pests,\n\nsmall insects like that are really down\n\npretty close to the base of the food chain.\n\nAnd you think about all the things\n\nthat eat mosquitoes and flies,\n\nthere are a lot of birds, frogs,\n\nother amphibians, small mammals.\n\nAnd so you know what?\n\nIf you wanna precipitate an extinction event,\n\nif you wanna wipe out the big animals, kill off the insects,\n\nthat's the best way to do it.\n\n@Hombre_del_queso, or Cheese Man,\n\nHow many animals have humans hunted to extinction?\n\nCertainly we have examples.\n\nWhen the government of Australia\n\nput a bounty on the Tasmanian tiger,\n\npeople went out and shot every single one of them.\n\nThere's a heartbreaking film of the last Tasmanian tiger\n\ncircling rearly in this cage,\n\nand that was the last of its species.\n\nPassenger pigeons, we killed all of them just for sport.\n\nThey used to block out the sun for hours\n\nwith flocks of billions.\n\nDodos, Dutch sailors would club them to death.\n\nThey wouldn't eat them, they would just stack them up\n\nand use them for firewood.\n\nThe same thing happened to the great auk,\n\nwhich was sort of the penguin of the North Atlantic.\n\nAnd then if you go back a little further in time\n\nto Stone Age humans, the woolly mammoth,\n\nand the woolly rhino, and the giant ground sloth,\n\nand all those amazing Pleistocene creatures\n\nthat all of a sudden died when humans showed up.\n\n@Based_shiver states, 'Invasive species are bad.\n\nThey outcompete native ones!'\n\nYeah, so? It's called the free market.\n\nIt's true, in that there's natural selection\n\nthat is occurring,\n\nbut invasive species for the most part,\n\nare able to invade those places because of us,\n\nbecause of our transportation systems,\n\nor sometimes intentionally humans releasing them\n\ninto the environment.\n\nAnd the result of that is that native species go extinct,\n\nnative species that are important in the ecosystem\n\nor important to us as maybe a food crop,\n\nand so, you know, I don't think we wanna really be playing\n\nplanetary engineer with the Earth's biosphere.\n\n@Deathbykoolaidman writes,\n\nWhat extinct animals do you think\n\nis really just hidden away from humans?\n\nI would be surprised if us paleontologists\n\nhave discovered 1% of the species that have ever lived.\n\nAnd if you look at just the group that we call dinosaurs,\n\nif you go back to the early part of the last century,\n\nthere was a new dinosaur species published\n\nabout once every year.\n\nBy the seventies, it was about a half a dozen a year.\n\nAnd now, it's about one a week.\n\nNow there are some animals that were at one point\n\nbelieved to have gone extinct, that are later found alive.\n\nIt's very, very rare,\n\nthey're actually called Lazarus species,\n\nand a good example of that would be the coelacanth,\n\nwhich is a very ancient fish.\n\nIt lived alongside of the dinosaurs,\n\nand it was believed to be extinct until one was dredged up\n\noff the coast of South Africa in the 1930s.\n\nThere's a pine tree called the Wollemia pine\n\nthat was thought to have been extinct\n\nsince the Cretaceous period,\n\nand in the nineties, it was discovered alive\n\nin a valley in Australia.\n\nSo this can happen, but it's very, very rare.\n\nMost things that we determine\n\nare extinct in the fossil record, we never see again.\n\n@GreatBluePanda asks,\n\nWhat if super-volcano 'Yellowstone' erupts?\n\nWhat happens to all species?\n\nWell, probably bad things.\n\nYellowstone is a giant super-volcano.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't discovered until just a few decades ago\n\nbecause it's so big,\n\ngeologists didn't know they were inside a volcano.\n\nIt was when satellite imagery started to become available\n\nthat we saw Yellowstone as this huge, huge volcanic caldera.\n\nThe last time it had a really huge eruption\n\nwas about 600,000 years ago,\n\nand parts of the West were covered with 600 feet of ash.\n\n600 feet.\n\nIf that were to ever happen again,\n\nit would take out a lot of the United States.\n\nEven here in New York, a couple thousand miles away,\n\nthere would be terrible effects.\n\nThe ash would reach New York,\n\naviation here, and probably globally, would shut down.\n\nIt's probably not going to erupt tomorrow,\n\nbut there is going to be a tomorrow someday.\n\n@Maverick8358 writes,\n\nWould we as humans be extinct\n\nif another Chixilub asteroid hit Earth?\n\nProbably not. Not at least initially.\n\nAnd when an asteroid hits, the most deadly moment\n\nis when the fallout comes in,\n\nthe rock and the dust that's blasted from the impact zone\n\ngoes into space\n\nand then resettles back through the atmosphere.\n\nYou can imagine the energy released\n\nby the impact in the case of the asteroid\n\nthat wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nA body of rock the size of Massachusetts\n\ntimes 12 miles deep, was blasted into space.\n\nSo that day when the dinosaurs died,\n\nglobal temperatures got up to probably somewhere between\n\ntoaster oven and pizza oven.\n\nAnd that means if you were on the surface\n\nof the Earth that day, you were dead.\n\nNow if that happened in today's world,\n\nit would surely be calamitous.\n\nBut a lot of humans are underground, they work underground,\n\nthere's tunnels underground, there's subways,\n\nthere are defense facilities underground,\n\nso, certainly, some humans would survive that day.\n\nWe'd probably be in a Mad Max situation for some time.\n\nWhether we pull out of that or not, who knows?\n\n@Brrrtje writes, How strong is the evidence\n\nfor an alternative hypothesis for the dinosaur extinction?\n\nWell, I would say, weak at this point.\n\nThere are other hypotheses\n\nthat have been out there for decades.\n\nFor example, maybe volcanoes wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nWell, that sort of thing\n\ntakes hundreds of thousands or millions of years,\n\nand it would unfold gradually around the planet,\n\nand it doesn't look like the instantaneous extinction\n\nthat we see in the fossil record.\n\nSome people have said,\n\nWell, the dinosaurs weren't doing so well\n\nleading up to the extinction,\n\nso they really died of multiple causes.\n\nAnd, A, we have no evidence that they weren't doing well.\n\nWe don't have that kind of resolution in the fossil record.\n\nAnd actually, it looks more like they were doing great\n\nand their biodiversity was flourishing.\n\nBut to say that they died of multiple causes\n\nwould be something like saying,\n\nBob had a cold and he got shot by a bazooka,\n\nso he died of multiple causes.\n\n@Smudgey90 90 asks, What stopped dinosaurs\n\nreemerging as the dominant species after the meteor event?\n\nWell, death. Death is hard to come back from.\n\nBut, birds tried. We call birds avian dinosaurs.\n\nA flamingo or a hummingbird is a dinosaur to the same degree\n\nthat a stegosaurus or a triceratops is.\n\nWe have certain anatomical features\n\nthat you have to have to be considered a dinosaur.\n\nAnd if we go back to the very first creature\n\nthat satisfies those criteria,\n\n237 million years ago,\n\na fossil found in Africa that we call Nyasasaurus,\n\n100% of that species' descendants,\n\nthat's the group that we call dinosaurs.\n\nSo when I say that dinosaurs went extinct\n\n66 million years ago, what I'm really talking about\n\nis the non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nBut some avian dinosaurs survive until today.\n\n@SwenRoschlau asks, Would human evolution,\n\nthe evolution of higher intelligence,\n\never been possible without this mass extinction event?\n\nOr would it have taken a different course?\n\nI think it would've almost certainly\n\ntaken a different course.\n\nEarth history is so contingent.\n\nIf you run the the movie of life on Earth back,\n\nit never turns out the same way twice.\n\nIf you can imagine\n\nthat asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs,\n\nwell, that formed the same time the solar system did\n\nfour and a half billion years ago.\n\nGo out to the asteroid belt at that time\n\nand hit that asteroid with a piece of popcorn,\n\nand then 66 million years ago, it doesn't hit the Earth.\n\nAnd our mammalian ancestors\n\nduring the entire reign of the dinosaurs,\n\nwere little, tiny, nocturnal shrew-like creatures\n\nliving in the hidden and forgotten recesses\n\nof the dinosaur world.\n\nThey could never really get anywhere\n\nuntil the dinosaurs went extinct.\n\nAnd then the dinosaurs went extinct and almost immediately,\n\nearly primates evolve,\n\nsome mammals return to the sea, they become whales,\n\nsome mammals become big predators, big herbivores.\n\nNone of that happens,\n\nI think including intelligent species such as us,\n\nwithout the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nA Reddit user asks, 99% of all living things\n\nthat ever lived on Earth are now extinct.\n\nFact or fiction?\n\nIt's fact-ish.\n\nWe don't know the exact percentage,\n\nbut certainly the vast, vast majority\n\nof creatures that ever lived,\n\nsomething approaching 99% have evolved,\n\nthey've persisted for some amount of time,\n\nand then they went extinct.\n\nExtinction is a natural process,\n\nbut it generally happens gradually over geological time,\n\nnot in rapid succession, as is happening today.\n\n@Sangkancilguru opines,\n\nPandas are so bloody useless, they deserve to go extinct.\n\nWell, that's pretty judgy there, Guru.\n\nPandas have a place in this world just like we do,\n\nand they fulfill a role in their ecosystem.\n\nAnd pandas, like every creatures,\n\nhave an unbroken chain of ancestry\n\nstretching back 3.8 billion years\n\nto their microbial forebearers.\n\nThis is a lineage that's survived all five mass extinctions,\n\nincluding the one that wiped out the dinosaurs,\n\nbut they're having trouble surviving us.\n\nSo what does that tell you?\n\nLynne Irwin wants to know,\n\nHow did cockroaches survive\n\nthe dino-killing asteroid strike?\n\nWell, have you ever tried to kill a cockroach?\n\nIt's not that easy.\n\nCockroaches are small,\n\ntheir needs are meager, and they can get underground,\n\nand that is a formula for success.\n\n@Rnadeau12 writes, What will cause the extinction\n\nof life on the planet next time?\n\nVolcanoes erupting, asteroid impact, sunspots,\n\nor developing fatal diseases in a lab?\n\nWell, here's what we know from history.\n\nThere have been five past mass extinctions,\n\nand every one was caused by a climate crisis.\n\nThe last, a climate crisis caused by an asteroid impact.\n\nWe are experiencing a sixth extinction right now.\n\nWe're not quite at the levels, obviously,\n\nthat happened when the dinosaurs were wiped out,\n\nbut the rate of extinction that's happening right now,\n\nif it persists, will cause Earth's sixth extinction.\n\n@Yaboy asked, What if there was a mass extinction\n\nso big it wiped away all evidence of anything being there?\n\nWell, there was actually a time in early Earth history\n\ncalled the Age of Bombardment\n\nfour and a half billion years ago\n\nto 3.8 billion years ago,\n\nwhen there was still a lot of debris in the solar system.\n\nAnd so planet sterilizing impacts happened commonly.\n\nIt might well be possible\n\nthat microbial Earth got started several times,\n\nbut was wiped out by asteroid bombardment,\n\nand that wouldn't leave a record that we would ever find.\n\n@Stigmatronic writes, The whole concept\n\nof the sixth mass extinction is bogus for the most part.\n\nAnd you know what, Stigmatronic?\n\nI appreciate your skepticism.\n\nThat's essentially the basis of science.\n\nBut we have data for the assertion that a sixth extinction\n\nis underway right now.\n\nThe background extinction rate of vertebrate animals\n\nover the last 2 million years\n\nis to lose about nine species per century.\n\nWell, just in the last century,\n\nwe have lost 615 species of vertebrate animals.\n\nSome people think the rate might be\n\nas much as 100 times higher than the normal background rate.\n\nIf you look at not species,\n\nbut populations of wild animals today, this is shocking.\n\nSince 1970, there are 69% fewer wild animals on the land.\n\nIf that doesn't concern you, if that doesn't make you think\n\nthat a sixth mass extinction is underway,\n\nI don't know what data you would need then.\n\n@Lizwei34 asks, Why, WHY,\n\nare they attempting to bring back the woolly mammoth?\n\nAfter six full 'Jurassic Park' movies,\n\nmy brain cannot fathom how anyone\n\nwould possibly think this is a good idea.\n\nMY GOSH.\n\nA lot of people conflate recent creatures,\n\nlike the woolly mammoth, with dinosaurs.\n\nDinosaurs are truly ancient. Their world is gone.\n\nThat's 66 million years ago.\n\nMammoths were around only 3,300 years ago.\n\nMammoths lived in a world that had the great pyramids,\n\nthat had written stories, that had beer.\n\nThat's this world today.\n\nAnd they had an important place in an ecosystem\n\nthat still exists today.\n\nAnd so if we could bring back creatures,\n\nparticularly ones that are the keystone species\n\nin their ecosystems,\n\nmeaning species that lots of other species depend upon,\n\nthen that would be a good thing for our environment,\n\nfor our ecology,\n\nand it also has carbon sequestration ramifications.\n\nSo in some cases, it could be a partial answer\n\nfor the climate crisis as well.\n\nI happen to be on the Board of Scientific Advisors\n\nof Colossal Biosciences\n\nendeavoring to de-extinct the woolly mammoth,\n\nand the Tasmanian tiger, and the dodo.\n\nIf there was a species that was on the brink today,\n\nif there were say only two of them left,\n\nlet's say those two animals died and it's two days later,\n\nwould you say, No, they're losers in Earth history,\n\nwe're done with them,?\n\nProbably not, right?\n\nWell, what if it was a week, or 10 years,\n\nor 100 years, or 1,000 years?\n\nI kind of have a Pottery Barn philosophy on this,\n\nwhich is if you break it, you bought it.\n\nI think if we're the agents of their demise,\n\nwe have a moral and ethical responsibility\n\nto resurrect them and their ecosystems.\n\n@Dangerous-Hotels-7839 writes,\n\nHave there been animals that were hunted to extinction\n\nby other animals and not humans?\n\nThere are lots of examples.\n\nFor example, in Hawaii today,\n\nexotic egg-eating snakes\n\nare wiping out many bird populations.\n\nIn New Zealand, house cats, which are not indigenous,\n\nare wiping out ground nesting birds.\n\nRats are one of the things\n\nthat push the dodo to extinction in Mauritius.\n\nIn the fossil record, when we see land masses connect,\n\nthat often leads to extinction.\n\nOne of the things that caused\n\nthe worst mass extinction ever,\n\nthis happened about a quarter billion years ago,\n\nwe call it the Great Dying, we think was caused by\n\nthese giant volcanic fissures in Siberia,\n\nbut it was exacerbated by the fact that all the continents\n\njust happened to bump into each other at that time,\n\ncreating the super continent called Pangaea.\n\nWhen all the land masses are connected to each other,\n\nthen all the animals have to compete with the other animals,\n\nand it's very hard on life.\n\nWhen land masses are fragmentary,\n\nwhen you have lots of islands and little continents,\n\nthen there's lots of little niches\n\nthat different species can occupy,\n\nand that usually leads to an increase in biodiversity.\n\n@BridgetHowell writes, 'Species of least concern'?\n\nWhat does that mean? It sounds so sad.\n\nIt means that they're not threatened,\n\nand threatened includes vulnerable, endangered,\n\nand critically endangered,\n\nwhich is the worst category to be in.\n\nSo least concern just means\n\nthat the population is fairly stable.\n\nAn example of a species of least concern\n\nwould be the laughing gull.\n\nThey're all over the country really.\n\nThey're doing just great, they love being around humans,\n\nthey love eating your hot dogs and your popcorn on the beach\n\nand they're doing just fine.\n\nA critically endangered species\n\nwould be something like the northern right whale.\n\nThere's probably only about 25 of them alive in the world.\n\n@SaintFiasco asks, What are the five mass extinctions?\n\nThe first one that happens is at the end of\n\nthe Ordovician period around 400 million years ago.\n\nLife is confined to the oceans at this point,\n\nand most of that is in the shallow seas.\n\nContinents are drifting south.\n\nIt initiates a glacial period.\n\nThe sea level drops,\n\nso it drops off of these shallow shelf areas\n\nand it's just habitat loss,\n\nand so we have a mass extinction event.\n\nLife recovers,\n\nand then we're in the Devonian period after that.\n\nThat seems to be a combination of climate change\n\nand bad ocean chemistry.\n\nThere's a lot of evidence of anoxic water,\n\nwater that doesn't have enough oxygen in it\n\nbecause it produces these black shale deposits\n\nin the Devonian, and so we have that mass extinction.\n\nAnd then the third mass extinction,\n\nthe worst of all, is called the Great Dying.\n\nIt happens at the end of the Permian period\n\nabout 250 million years ago.\n\nThat is the result of these giant volcanic fissures\n\nin what is now Siberia,\n\nbelching forth immense quantities of greenhouse gases,\n\ncausing the planet to overheat,\n\njust like is happening today.\n\nThat in combination with Pangaea forming,\n\nmaking all the animals have to compete\n\nwith all the other animals, it was really tough on life,\n\nand we lose about 95% of species.\n\nWe lose these little guys. This is known as a trilobite.\n\nThey almost look like underwater bugs,\n\nbut they evolved about a half a billion years ago,\n\nand they were super successful\n\nfor about a quarter billion years.\n\nBut then by the end of the Permian period,\n\ntheir immense run across deep time is over\n\nand they go extinct.\n\nAnd then we go into the Triassic period,\n\na really hard time for life on Earth,\n\nthe world is recovering from this Great Dying event.\n\nAnd then those volcanic fissures in Siberia,\n\nthey open up again, causing another mass extinction.\n\nAnd then after the Triassic,\n\nwe really get into kind of the sweet spot\n\nof the dinosaur age.\n\nWe're in the Jurassic period now. Things are going great.\n\nDinosaurs are getting big, they're getting biodiverse.\n\nWe get into the Cretaceous period,\n\nthat's kind of the flower of the dinosaur world\n\nand dinosaurs are cosmopolitan.\n\nThey're in all kinds of niches,\n\nthey're are all kinds of sizes,\n\nand then an asteroid hits and murders them,\n\nand it's over that day.\n\nAnd then we get into the age that we are in now,\n\nthe last 66 million years,\n\nthat becomes the age of mammals,\n\nonly because the playing field was cleared by that asteroid.\n\nAnd now what's happening now, we are causing the beginnings\n\nof the world's sixth mass extinction.\n\n@Throwawaysimples writes the trolling question,\n\nI think deforestation is a good thing. Change my view.\n\nWell, Throw Away Simples, how do you like breathing?\n\nBecause most of your oxygen comes from plants.\n\nThe Earth has two great lungs,\n\none is the phytoplankton in the ocean,\n\nthe other is really the Amazon rainforest.\n\nRainforests such as the Amazon,\n\nalso have the highest biodiversity in the world.\n\nAnd where do you think your medicines come from?\n\nWell, they come from discoveries made from plants,\n\nand animals, and microorganisms,\n\nthat mostly live in tropical rainforests.\n\nSo if you like not dying of horrible diseases,\n\nyou should be pro-forest.\n\n@Realmfoster says,\n\nI don't understand why sharks have to exist.\n\nWell, there's really no why in evolution.\n\nThere's no forethought.\n\nAnimals exist because they happened,\n\nand sharks happened a long time ago.\n\nSharks were around a couple hundred million years\n\nbefore the dinosaurs.\n\nThey persisted through the entire reign of the dinosaurs.\n\nThey survived the mass extinction\n\nthat wiped out the dinosaurs.\n\nAnd obviously, they exist today.\n\nBut you know what they're having trouble with? Us.\n\nThere's a lot of sharks\n\nthat are critically endangered right now\n\nbecause they're being over-fished\n\nand because their environments are being destroyed,\n\nsuch as the great hammerhead shark, which is endangered.\n\nAnd they are the apex predators\n\nin many of the ecosystems in which they live,\n\nand predators are important.\n\nIt keeps actually the prey populations healthy\n\nbecause it winnows out the ones that are diseased,\n\nthat could spread those diseases through the population.\n\nIt causes natural selection, which causes the prey species\n\nto become faster, stronger, quicker.\n\nAnd so we really need sharks in this world.\n\nOkay, that's it. That's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something. Until next time.",

It smells funny.\n\nThere is an evolutionary theory about this.\n\nIt may help you to prevent eating something that's toxic\n\nto either yourself or the pregnancy during that time.\n\n@athonymw asks, What is vanishing twin syndrome\n\nand what are the causes?\n\nThis is a uterus and there is a fetus here,\n\nand this is one gestational sac\n\nand then there's a second empty gestational sac.\n\nAnd what that means\n\nis this pregnancy most likely formed two embryos,\n\nbut only one made it to the stage\n\nwhere you can see a small embryo and a heartbeat,\n\nand that's called a vanishing twin.\n\nThat twin vanished.\n\nThe other twin will go on to form a totally normal embryo.\n\nA vanishing twin in the first trimester\n\nis not considered to be a dangerous outcome\n\nthat causes an adverse pregnancy outcome.\n\nA lot of times when a twin gestation form,\n\n20 or 30% of the time,\n\nthere's a vanishing twin.\n\nIt's thought to be the main driver of this test\n\nthat we now do on most pregnant women\n\ncalled non-invasive prenatal testing being falsely positive.\n\nEvery once in a while,\n\nwhen we do that test and we sequence that DNA,\n\nthere's an extra chromosome 21, 13, or 18,\n\nor a change in the sex chromosome material.\n\nThat's thought to be because in vanishing twin syndrome,\n\nthe DNA may still be floating around\n\nin the maternal bloodstream\n\nand cause a false-positive result\n\nif that vanished twin was actually abnormal.\n\n@BlueNeptune asks,\n\nDo you think babies can taste in the womb?\n\nLike damn, that [beep] is eating spaghetti again?\n\nActually, flavor molecules can pass\n\nfrom the maternal bloodstream through the placenta\n\nand into the amniotic cavity.\n\nIt's possible that there are flavor molecules passing\n\ninto the fetal mouth and through the nose\n\nso that they can smell and taste what the mom eats.\n\nInfants do gravitate towards similar food choices\n\nas their moms do,\n\nso it's possible that that flavor conditioning\n\nand flavor imprinting happens in utero\n\nrather than just after they're born.\n\n@mesopissed asks, How the [beep] am I supposed to know\n\nif I'm going into labor\n\nwhen I've never been in labor before?\n\nThis is a tough question because it's true.\n\nThe vast majority of first time moms don't really know\n\nwhat labor feels like.\n\nThere's one really great rule of thumb\n\nin explaining how a patient can know that they're in labor.\n\nWe use the 5-1-1 rule.\n\nThat's where a patient feels cramping and contractions\n\nand pain in their abdomen\n\nand in through their pelvis every five minutes.\n\nAnd that pain lasts approximately one minute\n\nand it lasts for over an hour.\n\nAnd if it's happening\n\nand you have an hour of contractions,\n\nyou might wanna head to the hospital\n\nor at least call your doctor.\n\n@minetiract asks, Wait, do babies cry in the womb?\n\nThe amniotic fluid that is in the mother's uterus\n\nmakes it so that babies can't make really any sound,\n\nbut there are some studies to show\n\nthat perhaps at 28 weeks,\n\nbabies can start doing practice grimacing in the womb.\n\nWhen we are performing ultrasound,\n\nwe actually look for different kinds of practice movements.\n\nSo we're looking for practice breathing,\n\nwhich is where the diaphragm goes up and down,\n\nand you might be able to see fluid coming in\n\nand out of the nostrils,\n\nbut we don't usually look for practice crying.\n\n@Vhusie_N says, Cryptic pregnancy will always shock me\n\n'cause what do you mean you had cramps\n\nand the next thing you were giving birth?\n\nA cryptic pregnancy is where you don't know you're pregnant\n\nuntil the end of the pregnancy or the third trimester.\n\nCryptic pregnancy probably happens about one in 500 times.\n\nWe think that it most likely happens\n\nfor one of two sets of reasons.\n\nOne, there was some irregularity in your periods,\n\nor you were breastfeeding so that you didn't get periods,\n\nor you had bleeding in the early part of your pregnancy,\n\nso you didn't know you were missing a period.\n\nAnd the other part of cryptic pregnancy\n\nprobably has to do with mental health,\n\npatients who didn't recognize they were pregnant\n\ndue to mental health condition.\n\n@allicatto asks, Are you telling me that the easiest way\n\nto avoid cleaning cat litter is to be pregnant?\n\nWe really do advise women\n\nnot to change cat litter in pregnancy.\n\nThat's because some cats carry a parasite\n\ncalled toxoplasmosis\n\nand it can cause birth defects.\n\nToxoplasmosis isn't only found in the cat litter.\n\nIt can be found in the ground and in undercooked foods.\n\nIn other countries, like in Europe, specifically France,\n\nthere can be a higher level of exposure to toxoplasmosis\n\nbecause of undercooked meats and cheeses\n\nand things that may expose patients to parasites.\n\nThey actually test for it.\n\nIn the United States, it's less ubiquitous\n\nand we don't find that there's a need to test for it.\n\n@finstanSG says,\n\nAt how many weeks do you think a fetus becomes viable?\n\nThe early third trimester, probably at about 24 weeks.\n\nThat's when a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.\n\nThat may change with advances in neonatology\n\nand in technologies that can help earlier\n\nand earlier fetuses survive.\n\n@Kofi99 asks, Babies can poo inside the womb?\n\nYes, babies can poo inside the womb.\n\nWe call it meconium.\n\nMeconium is really a natural byproduct\n\nof swallowing the skin cells\n\nand the hair cells in the amniotic fluid\n\nall the way through the first, second,\n\nand third trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nThis happens about 13% of the time,\n\nand we can see that greenish tinge\n\nto the amniotic fluid at birth.\n\nIt can be important in the neonatal period\n\nbecause an increase in meconium\n\ncan sometimes make it more difficult\n\nfor babies to breathe once they're born.\n\n@trash_netflix says, How does Plan B work?\n\nIt basically delays ovulation for about 72 hours.\n\nIn a normal pregnancy, we wanna ovulate from our ovary\n\nand that egg comes into the tube\n\nand that's where it meets the sperm either in the tube\n\nor in the uterus.\n\nWhat Plan B does is it basically prevents ovulation\n\nso that there is no egg to meet the sperm during this time,\n\nwhich means you can't conceive\n\nduring the most important 72 hours after sex.\n\n@JanelleAngelie asks, Why does no one talk about\n\nhow terrible the first trimester is?\n\nIn the first trimester of pregnancy,\n\na lot of things are happening.\n\nYour body is changing so much.\n\nYou're getting all that progesterone,\n\nall that estrogen into your bloodstream.\n\nThe embryo is growing from a really small size.\n\nThe vast majority of the fetal organs are forming.\n\nUp to about 12 weeks of pregnancy,\n\nyou're seeing bone and skin and heart structures,\n\nand so organogenesis, that early part of the pregnancy,\n\nis super, super important\n\nand it probably does make you feel a little terrible.\n\n@Kensetsu6 asks, What happens in the second trimester?\n\nThere's continued formation of the organs\n\nthrough the second trimester.\n\nThat's when neurodevelopment begins,\n\nwhen the brain starts developing.\n\nThere's also development of teeth and other organs.\n\nThis is probably about a late second-trimester fetus.\n\nIt's no longer the size of a small embryo.\n\nIt's really growing up to about the mother's belly button\n\nor beyond.\n\nAlso, in the second trimester,\n\npeople start to feel a little bit better\n\nabout the pregnancy.\n\nThey're not feeling that surge of hormones.\n\nThey've sort of acclimated to that surge.\n\nIt's kind of called the golden trimester\n\nbecause people feel less nauseated,\n\nthey have more energy, and they're less fatigued.\n\n@KBrenishiaa says, Last trimester of pregnancy, 0/10.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nThe third trimester of pregnancy,\n\nsomewhere around 25 to 28 weeks,\n\ngoing all the way to when you deliver,\n\ncan be really difficult.\n\nThe fetus is growing about a half a pound a week.\n\nYour uterus is coming up to your diaphragm.\n\nThe uterus is pretty large like the size of a watermelon.\n\nThe uterine walls are really thinned out.\n\nYou're feeling heavier.\n\nYou're feeling more tired.\n\nThis is when all your organs are being sort of pushed\n\nin different directions.\n\nYou might notice a difference in how you walk and move\n\nbecause there's a change in the curvature of your spine.\n\nThere is a lot of fetal development happening\n\nin the third trimester.\n\nThere's vision developing.\n\nThere's taste buds developing.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nat the very tail end of the third trimester,\n\nyou're gonna get fetal lung maturity.\n\nAfter the baby's born,\n\nthey have to be able to take that first breath\n\nand use those lungs.\n\nSo the third trimester is really, really important\n\nfor that time.\n\n@breedp_ says, Why do so many people get pregnant\n\nwith quadruplets?\n\nEh, I don't really think it's true,\n\nbut there is a lot of media attention\n\non higher order multiples,\n\nmultiples that are more than twins,\n\nand that's usually more common\n\nusing assisted reproductive technology.\n\nCurrent technologies really try to avoid\n\nmore than two fetuses in the uterus.\n\nWhen you use in vitro fertilization or IVF,\n\nyou might get pregnant with one, maybe two fetuses.\n\nBut if you use different types\n\nof assisted reproductive technology\n\nthat make your ovaries excrete more eggs,\n\nyou might get pregnant with triplets or quadruplets.\n\nAnd we really, really, really try to avoid that\n\nbecause it's not that safe\n\nfor either the fetuses or the mother.\n\nBefore IVF, the most common reason\n\nwas kind of an error in ovulation.\n\nYou released two eggs at the time you conceived\n\nand you created twins,\n\nso it was more common in older patients,\n\nin patients nearing menopause to have twins.\n\n@Mongieeeeee asks,\n\nThe mortality rate with Black women during pregnancy\n\nand delivery is way higher than any other race.\n\nThat's true.\n\nBlack women have higher risks\n\nof maternal morbidity and mortality in pregnancy\n\nas compared to their white and Hispanic counterparts.\n\nWe're still working on why that is and what the reasons are.\n\nOne is possibly just structural racism\n\nwithin the health community\n\nand the ways we learn about health and healthcare.\n\nOther things include this idea of weathering,\n\nwhere if you face racism every day,\n\nyou actually may have worse health outcomes.\n\n@KashMadonna asks, Do the second pregnancy\n\nmake you show faster or something?\n\nThere is some plausibility to this.\n\nWhen you're pregnant the first time,\n\nyour muscles haven't spread.\n\nThere hasn't been that diastasis of the muscles\n\nin the front of the abdomen yet,\n\nbut in the second pregnancy,\n\nall of that musculature\n\nis already sort of stretched and moved,\n\nand so that growing uterus shows more quickly\n\nbecause there isn't as much of a force downward\n\nas there would be in the first pregnancy.\n\n@neo_manceo asks, Guys, is there a difference\n\nbetween termination of pregnancy and abortion?\n\nYes, there is a slight difference\n\nbetween termination of pregnancy and abortion.\n\nAbortion can be either spontaneous, which means you miscarry\n\nor it can be a termination of pregnancy,\n\nwhere you elect to terminate because there's an abnormality\n\nor for any number of family reasons.\n\n@Daileeeeeen asks, As I keep getting further along\n\nin this pregnancy,\n\nall I want is junk food.\n\nThat is so off brand for me. I'm a healthy girl.\n\nIn the beginning of pregnancy,\n\na lot of women do just eat crackers\n\nbecause they're feeling so nauseated.\n\nDuring that early part of pregnancy,\n\nfetuses are very parasitic.\n\nThey're gonna take all the nutrients they need\n\nfrom the female body\n\nand they're gonna use it\n\nto create this embryo and this fetus.\n\nWhat's really, really, really important in pregnancy\n\nis to eat a healthy and well-balanced nutritious diet.\n\nNutrient-dense foods, so whole grains,\n\ngreen leafy vegetables,\n\nthings that have protein, Omega-3 fatty acids,\n\nanything that has vitamins.\n\nAs a mom, you're expanding your blood volume,\n\nbut also the fetus is actually making\n\nits own new blood cells.\n\nIt needs the components to do so, right, and so do you.\n\nYou need iron, you need B12, you need folic acid.\n\n@rufusjbacon asks, What is a pregnancy glow?\n\nI, for one, have never seen a pregnant person glow.\n\nThere is sort of a pregnancy glow.\n\nIt's one of just those biological things that's happening\n\nas you're getting pregnant and being pregnant.\n\nYour skin might get a little oilier.\n\nYour face might get a little rounder\n\nas you increase the fat content of your subcutaneous tissue.\n\nYou also notice many times stronger nails,\n\nthicker hair, fuller hair\n\nbecause you're not losing hair as much during pregnancy.\n\n@Tharealrambo951 asks,\n\nWhat happens to the baby if you smoke while pregnant?\n\nBabies can be smaller than they would be expected to be.\n\nThat's called small for gestational age.\n\nBabies that don't weigh quite as much\n\nas they should at birth.\n\nThey're also a host of other adverse outcomes\n\nthat we think are associated\n\nwith tobacco smoking during pregnancy.\n\nIncreased risk of abruption,\n\nthat's where the placenta separates from the uterine wall\n\nbefore it's time to deliver\n\nand can cause significant bleeding behind the placenta\n\nand even fetal loss.\n\nSo it's really important to consider quitting smoking\n\nduring pregnancy.\n\n@jacob sctj asks, Like have you seen what happens\n\nto your stomach on the inside as a baby grows?\n\nWhere do your organs shift and move?\n\nIn the very beginning of pregnancy,\n\nyour uterus is really, really small.\n\nIt's just sort of sitting in the lower pelvis.\n\nIt's only about the size of a lemon.\n\nBut as the uterus grows,\n\nit's growing up to your belly button or even higher.\n\nThere are a lot of effects on all of your organs.\n\nMost of the early effects are from progesterone.\n\nSo progesterone is a hormone\n\nthat's secreted by the placenta\n\ninto the maternal bloodstream.\n\nIt sort of lax in all of the cartilage\n\nand those ligaments that are all over your body,\n\nand it makes things looser.\n\nIt makes us able to adapt.\n\nYour intestines, which are really just flexible\n\nand no problem really,\n\nthey can just move aside and push to the sides.\n\nBut over time, in the third trimester, really late,\n\nyou might see that the pregnancy is really coming up\n\ninto your diaphragm.\n\nYou might even feel a little short of breath\n\nas the liver and the lungs are pushed upward.\n\nIt's not an instant quick change\n\nback to its normal shape and size\n\nat the end of the pregnancy.\n\nWomen leave the hospital really feeling\n\nlike they still look pregnant.\n\nThe uterus looks about 20 weeks pregnant,\n\nand as it shrinks down,\n\nall those organs shift and go down.\n\n@MamaMoxieB asks, I really need answers\n\nas to WTF preeclampsia is definitively.\n\nPreeclampsia is where you have an abnormal rise\n\nin your blood pressure at the end of pregnancy.\n\nAnd most likely it's happening\n\nbecause you are having all of these cytokines\n\nand inflammatory markers increasing disproportionately\n\nat the end of pregnancy, causing your body to react,\n\nalmost like it's an autoimmune response.\n\nPreeclampsia is basically caused by endothelial damage,\n\ndamage to the vascular system,\n\nand you can see signs of preeclampsia\n\nwith platelets dropping with your liver enzymes going up.\n\nPeople can develop headaches.\n\nPeople ask if preeclampsia is on the rise,\n\nand it turns out that probably preeclampsia\n\nis somewhat on the rise.\n\nThere's just more recognition\n\nof hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\n\nPatients getting pregnant later in life\n\nor using assisted reproductive technology to get pregnant.\n\nThere's also more obesity, which we think is a risk factor\n\nfor developing preeclampsia.\n\nThere's ongoing research to sort of describe\n\nhow and why preeclampsia happens in certain patients\n\nand not in others.\n\n@lsnxxxx ask, Okay, but like is pregnancy brain real?\n\nBecause during my pregnancy, I swear I felt illiterate.\n\nThere is like 15 to 40 times\n\nmore progesterone floating around in your body\n\nand it does change your brain and the way you think.\n\nAnd by the time the woman delivers,\n\nthey're these huge surges in oxytocin,\n\nwhich can really change the way you're thinking\n\nbecause oxytocin is a pleasure hormone.\n\nIt's really, really possible\n\nthat as we focus more on our pregnancy,\n\nsome of the other extraneous stuff\n\nthat we used to have at top of mind, no longer is.\n\nNow, what's more important\n\nis what's we're carrying in the uterus,\n\nand so there are pregnancy changes.\n\n@delltrick asks, Why do babies in the womb kick\n\nwhen they hear certain music?\n\nSurely they can't have that much experience\n\nbeing not born yet.\n\nLater in pregnancy, probably around 28 weeks,\n\nthe fetal auditory system really starts forming\n\nso they can start to hear.\n\nThey can hear music, maternal organ movement.\n\nAnd there are some studies to suggest\n\nthat auditory stimuli can make your baby move\n\nor kick in a different way,\n\nand that there may be some recognition\n\nof even the maternal voice\n\nor the paternal voice after birth.\n\n@alivo22_vo asks,\n\nWhy do you think it's important\n\nfor women to take prenatal vitamins when pregnant?\n\nEvery pregnancy really should have a prenatal vitamin.\n\nWe recommend them not just during pregnancy,\n\nbut in the three months before you conceive.\n\nYou need to be storing all these vitamins early\n\nin order to form the best and the healthiest fetus\n\nand to keep yourself healthy.\n\nIf you don't have enough folic acid in your bloodstream,\n\nyou're at higher risk\n\nfor developing neural tube complications,\n\ncomplications with your brain and the spine of the fetus.\n\n@Sirilloh ask, Us being pregnant an excuse to eat more\n\nor do pregnant women really need to eat for two?\n\nYou don't need to eat for two during pregnancy.\n\nWhat we really want is to see maybe a slight increase\n\nin caloric intake,\n\nbut not that much.\n\nThe fetus is gonna develop\n\nand grow as it normally would\n\nif you just eat your normal healthy diet.\n\n@dondang_syg asks, 3 months pregnant\n\nand I don't see any baby bump yet.\n\nIs that normal?\n\nIt's pretty common not to see a bump\n\nbecause the pregnancy is really only to about this level\n\nin your pelvis.\n\nSome women show really early,\n\nespecially patients in their second pregnancy\n\ncan really show even at three months pregnancy,\n\nbut others won't show that early.\n\n@taytheg asks, The only thing I've been missing\n\nthis whole pregnancy is sushi.\n\nYour obstetrician or your provider\n\nis not gonna want you to eat sushi during pregnancy.\n\nIt's because it's undercooked\n\nand you have a higher risk of being exposed\n\nto things that aren't safe for the pregnancy,\n\nlike listeria or parasites.\n\nThere are some forms of sushi that you probably can eat.\n\nVegetarian sushi, eel, those are cooked,\n\nso if you're really missing sushi,\n\nyou could try those things.\n\n@moonsyoong asks, Does pregnancy change your voice?\n\nThe short answer to that is probably yes.\n\nPregnancy does change voice.\n\nThere is a change in sort of that nasal congestion\n\nduring pregnancy as all the blood vessels\n\ncome to the surface.\n\nYour nose can kind of feel stuffy\n\nand make your voice sound different.\n\nBut there's also probably some voice box changes happening\n\nas that progesterone\n\nand estrogen is increasing in your bloodstream.\n\n@You_Addicted2Me says,\n\nNobody talks about how your teeth shift so bad during\n\nand after pregnancy enough.\n\nAs the early part of pregnancy has a lot of progesterone,\n\nthere's a change in your gums\n\nand your teeth can move and shift during pregnancy.\n\nIt's not uncommon, and maybe we don't talk about it enough.\n\nThe one thing that a lot of patients notice\n\nis that when they brush their teeth,\n\nthey see a little bit of extra gum bleeding.\n\nThat's completely normal in pregnancy.\n\n@kaykiire asks, I don't know why,\n\nbut I love that little dark line\n\nthat be on pregnant bellies.\n\nThat little dark line is called a linea nigra,\n\nand it's essentially where the two parts\n\nof your abdomen came together\n\nwhen you were in your own mother's uterus.\n\nDuring pregnancy, all the hormones\n\ncan make it so that melanocytes come to the surface,\n\nnot only in that linea nigra,\n\nbut you can notice darker areas in your skin and your face\n\nand other places.\n\n@Lindambui asks, I was today years old\n\nwhen I learned about fetal microchimerism.\n\nAs a mother, I'm simultaneously awed, happy, and terrified.\n\nFetal microchimerism is where there are fetal DNA\n\nor particles in the maternal bloodstream.\n\nThe mother, after she has the fetus, can have those cells\n\nin that DNA in her maternal bloodstream forever.\n\nWhen a woman is donating organs to somebody\n\nthat she's a genetic match for,\n\nfetal microchimerism can make that match\n\na little bit more tenuous\n\nbecause she's got some DNA from her fetuses\n\nin her bloodstream,\n\nso she may not be an exact match.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for asking such fun and interesting questions.\n\nAnd thanks for watching Pregnancy Support.\n\n[upbeat music]",

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Lindsay Chervinsky, Presidential Historian\n\nand Head of the George Washington Presidential Library.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is President Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntownandthat asks, Can Trump run again in 2028?\n\nNo, Trump is constitutionally barred\n\nfor running for a third term.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment, which was passed\n\nafter FDR ran for four terms,\n\nsays that presidents can only run for two full terms.\n\nPrior to FDR,\n\npresidents generally followed George Washington's precedent\n\nof only serving for two terms,\n\nbut that was voluntary and not required by law.\n\nGrizzly-Redneck asks, What's going on with Joe Biden\n\npardoning his own son?\n\nWell, in Article II of the Constitution,\n\nthe president is given almost unilateral authority\n\nto issue pardons on federal offenses\n\nexcept for those relating to impeachment.\n\nSo while lots of presidents have issued pardons,\n\nwe don't necessarily like or maybe feel a little bit gross,\n\na president's pardon power is almost unilateral.\n\nGeorge Washington was the first president to issue a pardon.\n\nOne of his first was to a rum smuggler in April of 1794.\n\nSludgegaze asks, Was the political divide always this bad?\n\nThere certainly have been times\n\nwhere we've had very bad partisan tensions and a big divide\n\nbetween the two different political parties.\n\nThe 1790s, the 1850s, the 1890s, and the 1960s\n\nwere all times when political rhetoric\n\nand how people talk to one another were really intense\n\nand often quite nasty.\n\nJohn Adams often referred to one of his political rivals,\n\nAlexander Hamilton, as a puppy,\n\nwhich was the ultimate insult to masculinity in the 1790s.\n\nAnd John Adams' critics\n\nsaid he had a hermaphroditic character\n\nbecause his values constantly shifted.\n\nThere have been times when things have been better,\n\nwhen political campaigns weren't quite so awful,\n\nbut this moment that we're in now is probably as bad\n\nas some of the other ones we've lived through.\n\nHiCatWhisperer asks, How did we end up\n\nwith two stupid unpopular political parties\n\nthat are pretty much our only alternative?\n\nExcellent question.\n\nWe have what's called a two-party system.\n\nThere have been other parties\n\nover the course of American history\n\ngenerally as one of the major parties breaks down\n\nand there are various different factions.\n\nSo for example, in the 1840s and 1850s,\n\nthere was a Know Nothing party, there was the Freedom Party,\n\nthen eventually the Republican Party\n\nmerged a lot of those different factions into one new party.\n\nBecause of the way our primary system works\n\nand the way our Congress works,\n\nit's really hard for a third party to gain any traction,\n\nbut that's not necessarily the case\n\nin other types of systems.\n\nFor example, if you have a parliament like in Great Britain,\n\nthere are lots of parties that have to build coalitions\n\nin order to have governing power.\n\nAlecEmley asks, Why do we even have a State\n\nof the Union address anymore?\n\nIt's a waste of everyone's time.\n\nThe State of the Union is actually required\n\nin the Constitution.\n\nArticle II says that the President shall from time to time\n\ngive updates to Congress on the State of the Union.\n\nGeorge Washington called these his addresses to Congress\n\nand he noted that they were indeed a required act.\n\nWhat's interesting about the states of the Union\n\nis from Thomas Jefferson to Woodrow Wilson,\n\nthey were in writing\n\nand the president would deliver a written address.\n\nWoodrow Wilson went back to delivering this speech in person\n\nand they have been in person at Congress ever since.\n\nAnd here at George Washington's Presidential Library\n\nat Mount Vernon, we have what's called an Acts of Congress.\n\nIn January of 1790, as George Washington prepared\n\nto deliver his first address to Congress\n\nor State of the Union, we think that he made these notations\n\nin his copy of the Constitution\n\nwhere you can see that he has written a notation\n\nthat says required next to the responsibility\n\nto give Congress an update.\n\nAnd indeed he did.\n\nEvery year of his presidency, he went to Congress\n\nand delivered a spoken address\n\ntelling them what had happened while they were on recess\n\nand giving some suggestions for what they might consider\n\nin the upcoming term.\n\nKy_marsh asks, Did you know Teddy Roosevelt\n\nwas shot before a speech and proceeded to give\n\nthe entire 90-minute speech with a bullet in his chest?\n\nYes, I did know that.\n\nA man named John Schrank thought that he was having visions\n\nthat told him to try and defeat Theodore Roosevelt\n\nfrom winning the presidential election in 1912.\n\nNow, what's amazing about why Theodore Roosevelt survived\n\nwas he had the speech folded up in his pocket\n\nand because the speech was so long, the paper was so thick\n\nthat it actually slowed down the bullet and saved his life.\n\nAfter he was shot, Theodore Roosevelt said,\n\nyou can't bring down a Bull Moose,\n\nwhich is where the name Bull Moose party comes from.\n\nRheaSoccerCrazy asks, So apparently teddy bears\n\nwere named after former US Prez Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy?\n\nTheodore Roosevelt went on a bear hunt after his presidency,\n\nbut he wasn't successful, and he couldn't get any,\n\nand it made him really mad.\n\nSo the people he was with actually captured one\n\nand tied it up to a willow tree\n\nso that he would have the opportunity to shoot a bear.\n\nBut he felt like that wasn't very sporting\n\nand wasn't really fair to the bear,\n\nso he refused to kill it.\n\nA political cartoonist depicted this scene\n\nand a candy maker who had a toy and candy store\n\nsaw this cartoon and thought it would make\n\nan excellent children's toy.\n\nThe toy maker received permission to use Teddy's name\n\nfor the bear, and the teddy bear was born\n\nand has been known as such ever since.\n\nBillShine8 asks, Has the peaceful transition of power\n\never been in more doubt?\n\nWell, we have had a number of very dramatic transitions.\n\nSo for example, when President Abraham Lincoln was elected\n\nin 1860, the South seceded before he became president,\n\nso that's about as bad as it gets.\n\nThen in 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected,\n\nit was in the midst of the Great Depression\n\nand economic conditions were horrible,\n\nbut Herbert Hoover really rejected the New Deal programs\n\nthat Franklin D. Roosevelt had suggested\n\nduring the campaign, and they spent several months bickering\n\nover what to do with the election\n\nbefore FDR was finally inaugurated in March of 1933.\n\nThe difference with January 6th\n\nwas that it was a contested transition.\n\nWe have never had one candidate to reject the outcome\n\nof an election, and we've never had people\n\ntry to overthrow the results of an election.\n\nThe South didn't like the result in 1860\n\nand so they left the nation.\n\nThat's a very different thing.\n\nyatpay asks, In the United States,\n\ndoes the president have access to all levels\n\nof classified information?\n\nYes, the president has access to all classified information\n\nand all of the top secrets in the United States.\n\nHockeymadman asks, What does the\n\ndo all day anyway?\n\nSo the president does a lot of different things.\n\nThe president consumes intelligence.\n\nThe president talks with foreign leaders,\n\nmakes really difficult decisions 'cause no easy choices\n\ncome to the Oval Office.\n\nThe President meets with business leaders,\n\nand labor leaders, and members of Congress,\n\nand state governments.\n\nThe president hosts really important social receptions.\n\nThose can be for visiting dignitaries like state dinners.\n\nThey can be from championship teams\n\nthat we see sometimes at the White House\n\nor they can be students or kids\n\nwho they're trying to encourage\n\nto pursue their studies.\n\nWhat you can see here is an invitation\n\nfrom President George Washington to come to an event\n\nat the President's House in Philadelphia.\n\nThis social component of the presidency\n\nwas there from the very beginning\n\nand George Washington hosted events every single week\n\nduring his presidency.\n\ndavidkwong asks, What does the S in Harry S, Truman\n\nstand for?\n\nNothing.\n\nHe added it in later\n\nbecause he thought that he needed a middle initial.\n\nRordan508 asks, Wow, the Supreme Court in America\n\nshows the world USA does not do democracy.\n\nApparently, any incoming\n\ncan stack its highest court like it's a perk of office.\n\nwhile the Supreme Court size\n\nis not actually in the Constitution,\n\nit's totally up to Congress how many seats\n\nthere are going to be on the Supreme Court\n\nat any given moment.\n\nAnd indeed that number has changed.\n\nThe original Supreme Court was six justices\n\nand George Washington appointed all six,\n\nand then the replacements as they left.\n\nThe Supreme Court has evolved over time,\n\nsometimes for political reasons.\n\nFor example, the Federal Judiciary Act of 1801\n\nreduced the size of the Supreme Court making it harder\n\nfor Jefferson to appoint a replacement\n\nbecause he would be from a different party.\n\nTychus_Balrog asks, Why are American elections so long?\n\nWhy not just have them last two to four weeks?\n\nI agree, that would be great, and a lot of other elections\n\nin other nations are much shorter.\n\nOurs have actually expanded over time,\n\nespecially in the last couple of decades\n\nas they've become more expensive,\n\nas they've become competitive.\n\nBut there isn't really anything that says\n\nhow short or how long they can be.\n\nThe problem is if we try and limit that by law,\n\nthat could be a restriction of freedom of speech\n\nand we have a First Amendment, which makes it very difficult\n\nto limit political speech especially.\n\nSavannaahLeigh asks, Damn, did anyone know\n\nthe President Roosevelt had polio and hid it\n\nbecause of how the community saw disabled people?\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nFDR did have polio and he spent most of his presidency\n\nin a wheelchair.\n\nHe was able with the use of braces\n\nand support from his sons and his aides to prop himself up\n\nfor speeches and press conferences,\n\nbut by and large, he was unable to walk.\n\nHe hid it because at the time there was a sense\n\nthat if you were physically disabled,\n\nthat meant you were somehow mentally impaired as well,\n\nand he understood that it would make it much harder for him\n\nto become president and much harder for him\n\nto meet with other foreign leaders\n\nand exercise the type of power\n\nthat a president is required to use.\n\nThe secret largely remained such\n\nbecause the press were willing to cooperate.\n\nIt was pretty clear to people who were around him\n\nthat he couldn't move around,\n\nbut there was sort of a gentleman's agreement\n\nwith the press at the time that this was private information\n\nand it was not their story to share.\n\nFDR never really talked about this\n\nand this was only something that came out much later\n\nas people began to share photos\n\nand his family began to discuss his battle with polio.\n\nEmployeeAromatic6118 asks, What do you think\n\nof George Washington's take on political parties?\n\nGeorge Washington warned against political parties\n\nin his farewell address, which he published in September\n\nof 1796 when he announced his retirement.\n\nBut his ideas about political parties\n\nare often misunderstood.\n\nHe wasn't saying that people shouldn't have political ideas\n\nor that they shouldn't form groups\n\nto try and get things done.\n\nWhat he was saying is that when we form political parties,\n\nwe often identify as a Democrat or a Republican first\n\nand as American second, and that was really pernicious\n\nto the long-term health of the nation.\n\nInstead, he wanted people to remember\n\nthat they had more in common than what separated them\n\nand political parties tended to exacerbate\n\nthose differences.\n\nTalksexwithsue asks, Did George Washington\n\ndeal with any infectious diseases\n\nlike we see today during his presidency?\n\nYes, he did.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War,\n\nGeorge Washington had the Continental army\n\ninoculated against smallpox, and then during his presidency\n\nthere were several outbreaks of yellow fever\n\nin Philadelphia, and New York, and other coastal cities.\n\nAt the time, there was really a sense that disease outbreak\n\nlike this one was not a responsibility\n\nof the federal government.\n\nIt was a local or state issue.\n\nSo a lot of times the governors would issue quarantines\n\nto try and limit the spread of the disease,\n\nbut Washington and a lot of the other federal officials\n\nwould leave the city to avoid contamination\n\nand did not have any role to play in suppressing it.\n\nnephiguymom asks, I wonder how it would be\n\nif it was required that the vice\n\nbe from the opposite political party of the president?\n\nWell, we've actually had this happen once before.\n\nThomas Jefferson was the second vice president.\n\nHe was the vice president for President John Adams.\n\nThey were from the opposite political party\n\nand it was a disaster.\n\nJefferson actually came remarkably close\n\nto committing treason when he met with the French minister\n\nand encouraged France to continue its attacks\n\non American shipping and encouraged France\n\nto avoid any sort of diplomacy with John Adams\n\nbecause he felt that he would win the next election\n\nand he would offer them a better deal.\n\njpmoonv1 asks, Has any US president ever been fluent\n\nin a second language?\n\nYes, they have.\n\nThomas Jefferson and John Adams both spoke French.\n\nThey learned several other languages,\n\nespecially reading and writing.\n\nPerhaps the most fluent was John Quincy Adams,\n\nwho by the age of 12, spoke almost five languages\n\nand served as his father's secretary\n\nwhen John Adams went to Europe as a diplomat.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams continued to teach himself new languages\n\nthroughout the course of his life.\n\nSome of the more recent presidents\n\nhave less facility with language, though there are some\n\nwho have tried to learn some phrases\n\nto be able to meet with foreign leaders.\n\nAnd for example, George W. Bush did speak Spanish.\n\nBossman13156 asks, What was the greatest\n\nor most impactful speech in the history\n\nof the United States?\n\nWell, I think that has to be\n\nprobably FDR's Four Freedom speech in which he argued\n\nthat in order for the United States to survive\n\nas a democracy and take care of the American people,\n\nit had to provide for freedom of speech and expression,\n\nfreedom of worship, freedom from want,\n\nwhich basically means freedom from hunger or poverty,\n\nand freedom from fear because fear caused people\n\nto pursue things like authoritarian governments.\n\nAnd the speech was really important\n\nbecause it was done in the context\n\nof the looming World War II.\n\nIt was inspiring to people\n\nwho had to understand why they had to fight for democracy\n\nat a time when it didn't always seem like it was working.\n\nGySgtUSMC2 asks, Who do you think was the most influential\n\nfirst lady?\n\nI think that's probably Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt served as FDR's eyes and ears\n\nbecause he couldn't necessarily travel\n\ndue to having to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.\n\nSo she would travel around the country,\n\nshe would meet with average Americans\n\nand report back to him what she was seeing.\n\nShe also wrote a newspaper column\n\nand was the first first lady to have press conferences\n\nand she only invited female reporters,\n\nwhich allowed women to actually carve out a space\n\nin the journalism profession for the first time.\n\nBrightclaw431 asks, Did any of the first presidents\n\nhave any realistic chance of nipping slavery in the bud\n\nif they chose to do so?\n\nSo this is a really interesting question.\n\n12 of the early American presidents\n\nowned enslaved individuals,\n\nbut they didn't necessarily all feel the same way.\n\nPresident George Washington emancipated the individuals\n\nthat he owned when he died.\n\nAnd some of the other presidents like John Quincy Adams,\n\nwhile he didn't necessarily speak out\n\nwhile he was president,\n\nafterwards, he became a member of Congress\n\nand he regularly spoke out against slavery\n\nand the power of slavery in the South.\n\nPlainsViewer asks, How many presidents have died\n\nwhile in office?\n\nEight presidents died in office, four were assassinated,\n\nand four died of natural causes.\n\nWhich is actually pretty surprising\n\nbecause we've only had 45 men serve,\n\nwhich means just under 18% have died\n\nwhile they were president.\n\n_kierk asks, What the hell does the vice president do?\n\nThe vice president has two responsibilities.\n\nOne, they are to cast a tie-breaking vote\n\nif the Senate is divided on a piece of legislation.\n\nSecond is to have a pulse, to be a living replacement\n\nto take over the office of the presidency\n\nif he dies in office.\n\nFor the modern vice president,\n\nthat is still their primary constitutional responsibility,\n\nbut depending on their relationship with the president,\n\nsometimes they are also tasked with other responsibilities.\n\nFor example, Joe Biden was tasked\n\nwith overseeing the recovery\n\nafter the 2008 economic collapse.\n\nAnd more recently, Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nwas given the responsibility of the relationship\n\nwith the nations that primarily lead to immigration\n\nto the United States from the southern border.\n\nEverything else is really up to the president,\n\nand most vice presidents have been totally irrelevant\n\nin history.\n\nstirfried_WEISS asks, What did Ulysses S. Grant do\n\nto deserve being placed on a $50 bill?\n\nWell, Ulysses S. Grant did two really important things.\n\nFirst, he was the victorious general in the Civil War\n\nwhen the Union Army defeated the Confederate Army.\n\nSo winning the Civil War is a pretty big deal.\n\nSecond, as president, I think he's really underappreciated.\n\nHe worked really hard\n\nto try and bring the union back together\n\nafter the Civil War.\n\nHe worked hard to defend the civil rights\n\nand suffrage of recently emancipated African Americans,\n\nand he defended their rights and their liberties\n\nagainst violence from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nSo I think he generally deserves a lot more credit\n\nthan he gets.\n\nSine_Fine_Beli asks, Does Donald Trump\n\nhave unlimited authority to impose tariffs?\n\nWell, first of all, a tariff is basically a tax\n\nthat the United States imposes on an item\n\nthat is coming in from a foreign nation.\n\nNow, most people think that the foreign nation pays the tax\n\nand that's the end of it.\n\nBut what happens is the foreign nation\n\nactually increases the prices, and so that item\n\nthat is coming in is then more expensive for Americans\n\nhere in the United States.\n\nThe president does have broad power to put tariffs on items\n\nor on things coming in from foreign nations.\n\nHowever, Congress can check that power\n\nif it then rejects a tariff through legislation.\n\nBut this is a really interesting part\n\nof the President's responsibilities.\n\nWhile the president does have a lot of power over tariffs,\n\ntheir control over the economy is much more limited\n\nthan people typically think.\n\nFor example, Congress is the one that passes the budget.\n\nCongress is the one that raises funds.\n\nSo if you're concerned about the deficit,\n\nthat is a Congress question.\n\nInflation is even more complicated.\n\nInflation is affected by things like supply chains,\n\nconditions around the world, access to goods,\n\nhow much people want them,\n\nand while the President can take steps\n\nto try and ameliorate that inflation,\n\nthey don't have power to reduce it.\n\nAdditionally, things like interest rates\n\nare controlled by the Federal Reserve,\n\nand the Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent\n\nfrom politics.\n\nSo while the president can make a request,\n\nit's really up to them to change any sort of rate\n\nor make any sort of cut.\n\ndandinohill asks, When President Trump takes office\n\nin January, he will be the second\n\nto own two presidential numbers, 45 and 47.\n\nWho was the first president to do so?\n\n22 and 24.\n\nNo checking or cheating.\n\nThat would be Grover Cleveland.\n\nIn 1884, Grover Cleveland won his first election.\n\nHe was then defeated four years later.\n\nIn 1892, he came back and he defeated Benjamin Harrison\n\nand won his second term.\n\nA lot of the same concerns that voters had in 1888 and 1892.\n\nThings like immigration, tariffs, and the economy\n\nare issues that we are seeing today.\n\ngoodtobehuman asks, What is the deal with George Washington\n\nand the cherry tree?\n\nGeorge Washington did have cherry trees on his estate\n\nat Mount Vernon, and in fact,\n\nrecently we uncovered a discovery of preserved bottles\n\nthat had cherries in them.\n\nThe story with George Washington and the cherry tree\n\nis that when he was a young boy, he cut down a cherry tree\n\nand then when his father asked him about it,\n\nhe said, I cannot tell a lie and admitted to doing so,\n\nbut there is no truth or evidence that suggests\n\nthat he cut down a cherry tree when he was a child.\n\nThis is a myth that was made up by a man named Parson Weems\n\nor Mason Locke Weems.\n\nAnd he wrote a book about Washington\n\nshortly after Washington's death that was frankly filled\n\nwith a whole lot of garbage, but it suited him\n\nbecause he was trying to tell a story\n\nabout Washington's character and the national mythology,\n\nand it sold really, really well.\n\nalexalaurenxo asks, We're talking about\n\nthe Great Depression, and Anthony Moscato goes,\n\n'Where did all the presidents live\n\nbefore the White House was built?'\n\nLOL\n\nGeorge Washington lived in several different houses.\n\nHe lived in two different residences in New York City,\n\nwhich is where the seat of the federal government was\n\nfor about a year when he was first president.\n\nThe seat of government then moved to Philadelphia\n\nand he rented a house,\n\nwhich became known as The President's House,\n\nand he lived there until he retired in 1797.\n\nJohn Adams, the second president of the United States,\n\nlived there until November 1800.\n\nThen he moved to Washington DC\n\nwith the rest of the federal government\n\nand became the first president to live in the White House.\n\nEvery president since has done so\n\nwith the exception of James Madison\n\nonce the White House burned down in the War of 1812,\n\nand he moved just down the street to the Octagon House\n\nuntil it was completed.\n\nAnd Harry Truman also moved across the street\n\ninto the Blair House when there was a massive renovation\n\nof the White House during his term.\n\nhewhatwhat asks, How much blame could we actually give\n\nto Herbert Hoover for the Great Depression?\n\nIt definitely wasn't Herbert Hoover's fault\n\nthat the economy collapsed.\n\nThere were a lot of structural weaknesses and impediments\n\nin the way of a strong economy.\n\nThere was a big bubble that had collapsed once it was clear\n\nthat the speculation was not sustainable.\n\nWhere Hoover did receive a lot of blame\n\nwas his lackluster response.\n\nHe believed that the economy would right itself\n\nand capitalism could be trusted to take over,\n\nand he didn't do much to try\n\nand take care of the American people\n\nwhen they were really suffering.\n\nSo I think he could definitely be blamed\n\nfor not doing enough to try and fix the Great Depression.\n\nHistoryinBrief asks, So was Edith Wilson\n\nthe actual president for a year\n\nwhile Woodrow was recovering from a stroke?\n\n#EdithWilson1stWomanPresident.\n\nWell, she certainly didn't have the official title\n\nor the official office, but yeah,\n\nI think Edith Wilson was primarily acting as\n\nfor most of the time that Wilson was incapacitated.\n\nShe determined who came in to see him,\n\nwho got to talk to him.\n\nShe would report back his decisions at a time when we know\n\nthat he wasn't really able to speak\n\nand were not really sure he understood what was happening.\n\nSo she had enormous authority that was not elected\n\nor was given to her by the Constitution.\n\nWhat's most important about this\n\nis that most people didn't really know what was happening.\n\nThe cabinet had a sense that Wilson was far more ill\n\nthan people realized, but most people were not permitted\n\nto actually see the president,\n\nand so most Americans did not know\n\nwho was actually in charge.\n\nmai_tai_ty_tie asks Alexa,\n\nwhat presidents have been impeached?\n\nWell, there have been four impeachments in US history.\n\nThe first, Andrew Johnson, was impeached\n\nfor trying to remove cabinet secretaries,\n\nwhich violated the Tenure of Office Act.\n\nBill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath.\n\nAnd Donald Trump was impeached twice.\n\nFirst, for withholding funds from Ukraine\n\nfor political purposes.\n\nAnd then for his role in the January 6th insurrection.\n\nNo president has been removed from office.\n\nSouthBayBoy8 asks, There haven't been two presidents\n\nin a row of the same party since Reagan and H. W. Bush.\n\nWhy do you think this is?\n\nWell, I think the American people get frustrated\n\nwith a party.\n\nThey have relatively little patience\n\nand frankly, sometimes short attention spans,\n\nand so they want to elect something new.\n\nThat hasn't always been the case.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, of course,\n\nwon four elections in a row.\n\nAnd then Harry Truman won an election in his own right\n\nand he was from the same party.\n\nchopstickfury01 asks, Which\n\nwould you have the hardest time beating\n\nin a drinking contest?\n\nThat would have to be James Buchanan.\n\nJames Buchanan was known for being able to put down\n\nquite a number of bottles of liquor and not even show it.\n\nSo he would definitely drink me under the table.\n\nCratesofNutella asks, Just how much security\n\ndo past presidents get and how extensive is it?\n\nPast presidents get Secret Service protection,\n\nas do their spouses, and this was required\n\nby a law passed in 1965 after Kennedy's assassination,\n\nwhich recognized that both presidents and former presidents\n\noften receive threats and need additional protection.\n\nThe early presidents had no protection.\n\nThere were no gates outside the president's house,\n\nand there was no Secret Service.\n\nSecret Service didn't start protecting the\n\nuntil 1901.\n\nSo while some presidents like Abraham Lincoln\n\noccasionally had a military guard,\n\nit wasn't guaranteed by Congress.\n\nFormer presidents didn't start getting protection until 1965\n\nwhen Congress passed legislation\n\nensuring that presidents and first ladies\n\nreceive protection for the rest of their lives.\n\nRomanuva asks, Do Presidents age faster in office?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHave you seen the pictures?\n\nPresidents go gray so fast while in office\n\nbecause the demands of the job are so intense,\n\nthere are no easy decisions or choices\n\nthat come to their desk.\n\nThe working hours are often quite intense\n\nand you can really see the impact of stress on their face.\n\nA Reddit user asks, How has the office\n\nof the President of the United States changed over time?\n\nWell, in some ways, the office of the presidency\n\nreally hasn't changed at all.\n\nGeorge Washington established a presidency\n\nthat was the primary actor when it came to foreign policy\n\nand domestic crises and really carved out enormous powers\n\nin jurisdiction for himself and his successors.\n\nIn other ways, the executive branch has really expanded.\n\nWe have far more executive departments,\n\ntheir responsibilities are much greater,\n\nand the number of employees in them is so far beyond\n\nwhat could have been imagined in the 1790s.\n\nSo the scope of the federal government is much bigger,\n\neven if the idea of the president is the same.\n\nradiogirlkaren asks, Yep,\n\nAbe Lincoln was the tallest US president,\n\nbut who was the shortest?\n\nNo political comments necessary.\n\nTesting your presidential smarts.\n\nWell, that would probably be James Madison.\n\nJames Madison was either 5'2 or 5'3 depending on reports,\n\nand he was pretty frail as well.\n\nWhat's interesting is his wife,\n\nDolly Madison was probably 5'8 or 5'9,\n\nand she would wear these giant turbans\n\nto really accentuate her height.\n\nBarryGSexy asks, I wonder how many presidents\n\nkilled another human being\n\nand do we suppose any did so outside of the army?\n\nAndrew Jackson probably killed someone in duel, yeah?\n\nYou are right.\n\nIn May of 1806, Andrew Jackson killed Charles Dickinson\n\nover a dispute over a horse that Jackson owned.\n\nJackson was also wounded in the chest, but he survived.\n\nAnd this dual was later used against him\n\nin presidential elections, arguing that he was blood-hungry\n\nand he was eager to kill people.\n\nDrDigiPol asks, Trivia question,\n\nhow many US presidents have been arrested?\n\nBonus, name them.\n\nDuring the presidency, just one, Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nUlysses S. Grant was arrested while\n\nfor speeding down Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nin his horse and carriage,\n\nand he had been warned repeatedly by police\n\nthat he was going to fast, but he couldn't help himself\n\nand he really loved a fast ride.\n\ntylersyck asks, Who do you guys think\n\nwas the most stylish president of the 20th century?\n\nWell, Barack Obama got a lot of flack for his tan suit,\n\nbut I personally thought it looked great.\n\nOther presidents that were known for being quite debonair\n\ninclude John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan as well.\n\nifightpossums asks, What presidents had unusual interests\n\nor hobbies?\n\nFDR was an avid stamp collector\n\nand his stamp collection is still available\n\nat his presidential library.\n\ncal_lovr asks, How much do presidents get paid?\n\nCurrently, Presidents make $400,000 a year.\n\nOriginally, the salary was for $25,000,\n\nwhich was a huge amount of money in 1789\n\nwhen George Washington became president.\n\nBut that money had to cover rent for the president's house,\n\nlabor, food, all expenses related to travel,\n\nand anytime they hosted.\n\nSo it actually went really quickly.\n\nAnd most presidents in the early Republic\n\nleft office in debt.\n\nHumble-Translator466 asks,\n\nWhich president was the best practical joker?\n\nThis has to be Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nJohnson loved to play jokes on people,\n\nand in fact, he even had a car\n\nthat could work in the water as a boat.\n\nAnd so he would drive around guests on his farm in Texas\n\nand he would go too fast down a hill\n\nand cause them to think that they were gonna run\n\ninto the water and then the car would sink\n\nand instead, it would float\n\nand it would start puttering around like any other boat.\n\nHe always got a good laugh\n\nand he really loved their reactions.\n\ndatboyChicas asks, Quick somebody,\n\nwhy did President Truman decide to use atomic weapons\n\nduring World War II?\n\nThis was a decision that President Truman agonized over\n\nbecause he understood the repercussions\n\nand the scale of the death and damage\n\nthat was going to be done to the Japanese people.\n\nBut he believed that in doing so,\n\nhe was actually saving American lives.\n\nHis generals and his advisors had given him estimates\n\nfor how much it would cost\n\nand how many lives would be sacrificed\n\nto try and take additional Japanese territory.\n\nAnd he believed that in doing so,\n\nhe would end the war as quickly as possible.\n\nRealMrParamount asks, So what does Commander in Chief mean\n\nas defined in the Constitution\n\nof the United States of America?\n\nAnyone?\n\nAs the Constitution originally defines it,\n\nthe Commander in Chief is the person that is in charge\n\nof the armed forces of the United States.\n\nSo as president, they get to determine the officers,\n\nthey can appoint people,\n\nbut Congress is responsible for passing legislation\n\nthat determines the rules and regulations\n\nthat manage the Army, Navy, and other armed forces.\n\nRemoveDifferent3357 asks, Do you believe Polk's war\n\nwith Mexico was justified\n\nand should we view the war as a positive\n\nor a negative of his legacy?\n\nPolk's legacy is really interesting\n\nbecause he was generally viewed\n\nas actually one of the most effective presidents.\n\nHe came into office saying he wanted to accomplish\n\na couple of things, including annexing Texas\n\nand getting more territory in the Northwest.\n\nAnd he did those things and then he left after one-term.\n\nSo in terms of promises made, promises kept,\n\nhe is certainly up there.\n\nHowever, the war with Mexico was very much ginned up\n\nto try and seize additional territory,\n\nand in doing so, it killed a lot of innocent people,\n\nit displaced thousands of native Mexicans,\n\nand it led to the expansion of slavery in the American West,\n\nwhich was a major trigger that led to the Civil War.\n\nmyvotedoesn'tmatter asks, Who's your choice\n\nfor the best president on foreign policy?\n\nIt's really hard to choose best and worst\n\nbecause there are so many options.\n\nBut one of the most effective presidents on foreign policy\n\nwas George H. W. Bush, who oversaw the end of the Cold War\n\nin a peaceful way.\n\nThere were no nuclear explosions,\n\nthere was no World War III,\n\nand he did so exercising restraint and humility.\n\nHe didn't gloat and he really could have,\n\nbut he was only a one-term president.\n\nThe thing is, the American people very rarely vote\n\non foreign policy, and we tend not to reward people for wars\n\nthat don't happen or for avoiding conflict.\n\nWe do reward presidents when they win wars,\n\nand since George H. W. Bush didn't do that,\n\nhis contributions are often not as remembered\n\nas they should be.\n\nshu-ha-ri asks,\n\nWhy did Martha Washington burn George's letters?\n\nWell, it's 'cause he asked her to.\n\nJust like most people,\n\nthose letters probably contained all the snarkiness,\n\nand the humor, and the love, and the really intimate stuff\n\nthat we tend to share with our loved ones.\n\nThat's not how he wanted to be remembered.\n\nInstead, he wanted to be remembered\n\nas a little bit more aloof, a little bit more reserved,\n\nthe image he had crafted.\n\nKind of like a marble bust just like this one.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something.\n\nUntil next time.\n\n[upbeat music]",

Yeah.\n\nRFK Jr. has spread the myth that vaccines are linked\n\nto autism for several decades\n\nand it's a central feature of his organization,\n\nChildren's Health Defense.\n\nThat organization made over $23 million\n\nin 2022 alone.\n\nAnd in fact, recent investigative journalism has revealed\n\nthat RFK Jr. himself was being paid\n\nover $20,000 a week as the chairman\n\nfor Children's Health Defense in 2023 alone.\n\nThe purported link to autism and vaccines has been debunked\n\nand addressed over 20 plus years,\n\nand there is no relationship.\n\nThe biggest predictor\n\nfor autism is having an immediate family member also\n\nwith autism, which suggests\n\nthat there's a strong genetic link.\n\nThe prevalence of autism has increased,\n\nbut this is a function of diagnosis.\n\nWe have better, more appropriate diagnostic criteria\n\nto recognize autism cases, whereas in decades past,\n\nwe were not capturing\n\nand recognizing how prevalent autism truly was.\n\n@liza777777 wants to know,\n\nAre GMOs / Synthetic foods / vaccines harmful?\n\nThere's a common perception that GMOs,\n\nespecially food crops are some unnatural thing\n\nthat we've altered in a way that's harmful.\n\nBut the reality is,\n\nis that humans have been genetically modifying\n\nand messing with nature since the dawn of time.\n\nMost people don't know that the vegetables we know\n\nto be cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi,\n\nand cabbage are actually all genetically modified versions\n\nof the wild mustard plant.\n\nThey're the same species.\n\nModern day GMOs allow us to do this in a faster\n\nand more controlled way.\n\n@chefbai_ says, Dove has the best smelling deodorant.\n\nBring on the aluminum & cancer causing parabens\n\nbecause that shit smell good af.\n\nSo the good news is,\n\nis that aluminum salt in antiperspirants\n\nand parabens don't cause cancer,\n\nso you can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nParabens are a class of antimicrobials\n\nand they're used to inhibit contamination\n\nand inhibit the growth of bacteria\n\nand fungi that would contaminate a product\n\nthat you're using repeatedly.\n\nAnd they've been used in these products\n\nfor over a hundred years.\n\nThe levels at which you would be exposed\n\nto parabens are not posing any sort of harm.\n\nIt's why they've been asserted\n\nand reasserted as safe for use.\n\nPeople have been led to believe\n\nthat parabens are linked to breast cancer\n\nbecause there was a really terribly done study\n\nin the Journal of Applied Toxicology\n\nwhere they took breast tumor biopsies\n\nthat were stored in the freezer\n\nand they detected minuscule levels.\n\nWe're talking parts per billion\n\nof parabens in these breast tumor tissues.\n\nAnd when they looked at their negative controls,\n\ntheir blank values, levels of parabens detected\n\nin those were actually higher than some\n\nof the tissue samples, which actually suggests\n\nthat their instrumentation was contaminated.\n\nSo over here we have four different types of parabens,\n\nethylparaben and methylparaben bind 100,000 times\n\nmore weekly to estrogen receptors.\n\nSo one versus a hundred thousand\n\nof your actual estrogen hormone estradiol\n\nand butylparaben and propylparaben bind 10,000 times\n\nmore weekly, so 10 versus 100,000\n\nversus your estradiol hormone.\n\nSo the likelihood of these paraben chemicals\n\nactually outcompeting your estrogen hormones is near zero.\n\n@RoboSox_ wants to know, Are probiotics BS or nah?\n\nUnfortunately, they're more BS than they are, evidence.\n\nProbiotics are a type of supplement\n\nthat contain live microorganisms,\n\nbut there's 40 trillion bacteria\n\nthat live in your GI tracts\n\nand they make up hundreds of different species.\n\nThe problem with probiotic supplements is they usually\n\nonly contain one, two or a small handful\n\nof species of bacteria.\n\nThe reason that they're in the probiotic supplement is not\n\nbecause they've been identified to be beneficial\n\nfor your health, but they're relatively easy\n\nto grow in large quantities\n\nand so they end up in your supplement.\n\nBut there've been a lot of studies that have evaluated\n\nor assessed the ability of probiotic supplements\n\nto improve health,\n\nand unfortunately, there's really no data\n\nto support their use.\n\nThe stomach is very acidic\n\nand if a probiotic supplement doesn't have\n\nwhat we call an enteric coating,\n\nthose bacteria are very likely going\n\nto be killed by your stomach acids.\n\nSo there's no data to even show\n\nthat these supplements are even gonna make it\n\ninto your intestines where they need to be.\n\nPrebiotic is another term that we often confuse\n\nwith probiotics, but prebiotic is really\n\njust a fancy word for fiber.\n\nSo prebiotics are the food\n\nthat the bacteria in your gut are going to use\n\nto do what they do.\n\nWhile you might see supplements\n\nthat say they're filled with prebiotics,\n\nit's really just saying they're containing different types\n\nof fiber, and so you can get a lot of those health benefits\n\nthat we know we need from fiber just\n\nby eating some fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n@wordsmatter wants to know,\n\nWhich pseudoscience has done the most harm?\n\nI would have to say anti-vaccine misinformation.\n\nIt leads to the increased spread of infectious diseases,\n\nwhich means that we have increased amounts of morbidity,\n\nillness, and mortality death among populations\n\nwhere those illnesses and deaths are preventable.\n\nFor example, anti-vaccine misinformation\n\nabout the measles mumps and rubella vaccine.\n\nThe MMR vaccine led to a spread and outbreak\n\nin Samoa in 2019 that caused the death of 82 people.\n\nPrimarily children under five.\n\nVaccines are estimated to have saved over 150 million lives\n\nin the last several decades.\n\nThey truly are one of the miracles of modern medicine.\n\n@Reimerville wants to know,\n\nMy doctor advised against ozone therapy,\n\nis it helping people?\n\nNo, it is not helping people.\n\nOzone chemically called O3 is a type of oxygen compound\n\nthat makes up parts of our atmosphere.\n\nProponents of ozone therapy claim\n\nthat it has a variety of health benefits.\n\nThey inhale it, they use it in enema form\n\nand in some cases they will actually infuse it\n\nthrough a transfusion of your blood.\n\nOzone has zero therapeutic benefits\n\nand can be potentially very harmful,\n\nespecially if inhaled at very low doses.\n\nYour doctor's absolutely right there is zero reason\n\nfor you to expose yourself to ozone.\n\n@LoganHentz says, You don't detox from sweating.\n\nYou sweat water and salt not [beeps] toxins.\n\nDoesn't make sense for said toxins to just dry\n\non your skin does it?\n\nAbsolutely. Sweating is for temperature regulation.\n\nWhen you sweat, you secrete fluids, water,\n\nand some salts, and when that dries,\n\nit leads to a phenomenon called evaporative cooling,\n\nwhich means that your body now cools down as a result\n\nof taking that energy away.\n\nThe way that your body gets rid of toxins is\n\nthrough your excretory organs, so your lungs, your liver,\n\nyour GI tract, and your kidneys.\n\nThose organ systems are working all the time\n\nto remove any toxins or any substances\n\nthat your body just no longer needs anymore.\n\nPeople like to tout saunas as a method to detox,\n\nbut this is basically like accelerating your\n\nsweating process.\n\nA lot of people feel better after a sauna because the heat\n\nand the environment lets them feel more relaxed,\n\nbut it has nothing to do\n\nwith removing toxins from your body.\n\n@milk16478, What the [beeps] is alkaline water bro\n\nyou've been drinking bleach or something?\n\nProponents of alkaline water\n\nand the alkaline diet believe that increasing the pH\n\nof your body or reducing the acidity\n\nof your body can improve health outcomes.\n\nIt can prevent cancer, it can reduce inflammation,\n\nbut the reality is that you can't actually change the pH\n\nof your body.\n\nYour blood pH is very tightly regulated\n\nat around a pH of 7.4,\n\nand if you could change it, it would be life threatening\n\nand we can't change it\n\nbecause we have buffer systems\n\nthat maintain balance in our bodies,\n\nand there have been a lot of studies that have tried\n\nto show a benefit, but there just isn't.\n\nThe same goes for those at home water ionizer equipment\n\nthat you can pay $5,000 for\n\nthat is just adding extra minerals to your water,\n\nwhich is basically what alkaline water is.\n\nSo things like potassium hydroxide,\n\nmagnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.\n\nThese are chemicals that increase the pH of water\n\nto a pH of eight or nine or so on.\n\nThese substances are not offering any health benefits,\n\nand as soon as you drink this alkaline water,\n\nthat higher pH is gonna be neutralized\n\nby the acid in your stomach.\n\n@neesa_ondrea asks, If the moon affects how the tide rolls\n\nin and affects dementia Alzheimer's patients...\n\nThen why can't the stars affect human behavior\n\nand influence certain traits??\n\nThis is a confusion of a phenomenon called sundowning,\n\nwhich is a situation in which dementia patients,\n\nincluding Alzheimer's patients, have worsening symptoms\n\nas the day progresses.\n\nNow, there's a few theories as to why this occurs,\n\nand some of it has to do with just the progression\n\nof the disease itself,\n\nbut also the confusion that these patients are living\n\nwith the irritability grows as the day progresses,\n\nso they may appear to have worse symptoms\n\nas the day goes on, but it has nothing to do\n\nwith the sun setting or the moon cycle.\n\nIt's simply just that's later in the day.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no evidence to suggest that the stars\n\nand astrology has any impact on human traits and behaviors,\n\nand it's a long held arm of pseudoscience.\n\n@jay_snowdon wants to know,\n\nWhy are supplements pretty much unregulated?\n\nYet we strictly test the safety\n\nand efficacy of real medicine.\n\nAh, yeah. You can thank the politicians\n\nand the legislators of our US Congress.\n\nIn 1994 they passed in a bipartisan effort,\n\nthe 1994 Dietarily Supplement Health and Education Act.\n\nMany senators have financial motives\n\nto pass this law,\n\nparticularly Democratic Senator Tom Harkin\n\nand Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.\n\nBoth of them received extensive amounts\n\nof lobbying money from dietary supplement companies\n\nin order to push this legislation through.\n\nWhat this did was it removed the oversight\n\nthat the FDA had on dietary supplements.\n\nAs a result, that industry has grown exponentially\n\nand nearly all supplements on the shelves today lack\n\nevidence to support their use.\n\nSome examples would include a lot of your greens powders,\n\nthings like AG1 and other dietary supplements,\n\nlaming to give you your servings of fruits and vegetables,\n\nbut when actually analyzing the composition of them,\n\noften they don't contain measurable amounts\n\nof those products and worse, many contain substances\n\nthat are not disclosed.\n\n@mojopono wants to know,\n\nIs it true that #sugar in foods 'feeds' #cancer?\n\nThere's no clinical evidence that eating sugar,\n\navoiding sugar or anything related\n\nto sugar has an impact in preventing or curing cancer.\n\nThis misconception stems from the fact that we use a type\n\nof imaging called PET scan.\n\nSo on a CT scan you might detect a structure,\n\nbut on a PET scan we use a radioactive labeled sugar\n\nthat's taken up by your body\n\nand it lights up in regions\n\nwhere cells in your body are metabolizing\n\nthat sugar more quickly\n\nbecause cancer cells do have faster metabolic activity\n\nbecause they're growing very quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, this has been misinterpreted to lead people\n\nto believe that sugar itself is causing cancer\n\nwhen it's just a feature of certain cancer types.\n\nCancer cells will consume glucose at a faster rate\n\nbecause they need to take that glucose\n\nand make new cell components\n\nbecause those tumors are growing very quickly.\n\nSo it's not the sugar that's feeding\n\nor causing cancer, it's a function of\n\nhow cancer cells are using sugar that's available.\n\n@bubblegumonarch says,\n\nI knew receipt paper was thermal activated\n\nbut I didn't know that that coating is like toxic bpa\n\nwhat ??? I handle that [beeps] all day every day.\n\nBPA or bisphenol A is a chemical that's used primarily\n\nto help manufacture plastics.\n\nIn thermal receipt paper it's used as a coating\n\nto facilitate that printing.\n\nThere's a concern\n\nthat this chemical may be implicated in endocrine disruption\n\nor interfering with your hormones.\n\nThere've been some studies that suggest cashiers\n\nor other customer service people who handle lots\n\nof receipts over a working shift may be exposed\n\nto high levels of BPA.\n\nBut that particular study used an estimate value\n\nin a modeling equation that was orders\n\nof magnitude higher than\n\nwhat any other data set would suggest.\n\nSo they're skewing their data to overestimate\n\nhow much BPA someone would be in contact with.\n\nBPA is the same chemical when people express concern\n\nabout microwaving certain types of plastic\n\nand just as is true with the receipt handling,\n\nthe amount of BPA that might be in the food products\n\nthat you microwave is going to be orders\n\nof magnitude lower than what you would actually need\n\nto be exposed to in order to see some sort\n\nof impact on your hormones.\n\nAnd on top of that, BPA is rapidly metabolized by your liver\n\nand excreted so you don't have\n\nto worry about it accumulating in your body.\n\n@BrettNA70273495 asks, Question for you Andrea\n\nif you don't mind?\n\nWhat common household chemical would you say you are\n\ndefinitely worth avoiding?\n\nI know I probably eat too much Teflon\n\nbut still buy non-stick cookware.\n\nFor me personally, there isn't one thing\n\nthat I have in my house\n\nthat I would say I need to get rid of,\n\nbut there are certain considerations.\n\nSay if you live in an older home\n\nand you might have some antiquated plumbing,\n\nyou might wanna get that looked at\n\nto see if there's high levels of things like lead\n\nor if you have an old building\n\nthat maybe has asbestos in the walls or the countertops.\n\nSince you mentioned Teflon, that's an interesting topic\n\nbecause it's gotten a lot of attention in recent months.\n\nTeflon chemically is part of the class\n\nof chemicals called PFAS.\n\nNow PFAS incorporate thousands of different chemicals\n\nand Teflon chemically called PTFE is a very long\n\nchemical and it's very stable.\n\nAnd so the likelihood\n\nof you actually experiencing harm from being exposed\n\nto Teflon by using non-stick cookware is actually very low.\n\nWhen people are stressing about these exposures to chemicals\n\nthat generally don't have a big impact on their health,\n\nwe should be redirecting our focus\n\nto things like healthy lifestyle habits,\n\ngetting good quality sleep, eating a diverse diet,\n\nand staying up to date\n\nwith your preventative health screenings,\n\nwhich really are the things\n\nthat can impact your health.\n\n@UncouthPrimate wants to know,\n\nThere's an emerging trend\n\nof people claiming that sunscreen is more harmful than good.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nLet's clear up a few things.\n\nSo the reason that sun exposure is a risk factor\n\nfor cancer is because there are two main types\n\nof ultraviolet radiation, UVA and UVB\n\nand these ultraviolet radiation energy\n\nessentially penetrates your skin.\n\nThat energy is then transferred to molecules in your cells,\n\nwhich can cause DNA damage and mutations,\n\nand those mutations can ultimately lead\n\nto cancer the more you're exposed to it.\n\nBy taking a sunscreen\n\nand putting some of it on your skin,\n\nthe molecules of chemicals in the sunscreen now absorb\n\nthat energy and convert that to heat.\n\nAs a result, those ultraviolet rays don't get\n\ninto those deeper layers of your skin.\n\nThey're absorbed right by the sunscreen,\n\nand so your cells don't experience the damage.\n\nSo people are saying that chemicals\n\nthat you might find in sunscreens,\n\nparticularly your organic filters\n\nlike avobenzone are causing cancer\n\nand so it's causing more harm than doing good\n\nand preventing sun exposure.\n\nBut these chemicals have been extensively studied\n\nfor safety.\n\nThere's no clinical evidence that they're linked\n\nto cancer in any way.\n\n@daddypinx asks, wait, what do you mean there's arsenic\n\nand lead in tampons in the us?? i hate it here.\n\nThe good news is that this is blown wildly\n\nout of proportion.\n\nSo there was a recent study that went viral\n\nand really, really scared a lot of people,\n\nbut for no good reason.\n\nSo this study took 20 individual tampons\n\nand they took the fabric\n\nand they digested it with high temperatures, 350 Fahrenheit\n\nand an acid extremely concentrated to digest the fabric.\n\nAnd from there they used analytical chemistry equipment\n\nto look at the levels of different trace impurities,\n\narsenic, cadmium, lead, and so on,\n\nand they found very, very small quantities,\n\nwe're talking parts per billion.\n\nAnd for context, one part per billion is equivalent\n\nto one second of time in 31.7 years.\n\nBut I think we can all agree that 350 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nand a pH of one is not the environment of a vagina.\n\nFor context, a vagina is about 99 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nand a pH of 4.5.\n\nSo not only did this study actually show\n\nthat you're going to be exposed to any of this,\n\nbut the levels that they were detecting\n\nin the tampons are orders\n\nof magnitude lower than other things like tea leaves\n\nand water and cannabis.\n\nTampons are made outta cotton and cotton is a plant.\n\nAnd when plants grow in the environment,\n\nthey pick up elements and substances that are in the soil\n\nand in the air and in the water,\n\nand that's where lead, arson, cadmium,\n\nthese are all elements, right?\n\nThey're part of our earth's crust.\n\nSo you don't need to freak out about your tampons\n\nor throw them away,\n\nbut you also have to realize that this is something\n\nthat is universal to all plants,\n\nincluding ones that you eat on a daily basis.\n\n@AlBowers1 asks, Which vaccines contain mercury?\n\nNone of the vaccines contain mercury.\n\nThere's a preservative that's used to prevent contamination\n\nof vaccines with things like bacteria and fungi.\n\nThat is called thimerosal.\n\nAnd thimerosal is a salt\n\nof a different compound called ethylmercury.\n\nNow, ethylmercury is not mercury,\n\nit's a compound that contains a mercury ion.\n\nThis was conflated to suggest\n\nthat vaccines contained mercury.\n\nIt's also further confusing because there's a different type\n\nof a mercury compound called methylmercury.\n\nThat's the one that we're warned about eating too much fish\n\nlike tuna because the methylmercury is found everywhere\n\nand that can accumulate in our bodies.\n\nBut to illustrate this,\n\nI wanna talk about two different types of alcohol.\n\nSo we have rubbing alcohol here, which is isopropyl alcohol,\n\nand we have champagne, which is ethanol.\n\nWe know that ethanol is safe at relatively low doses\n\nand many people enjoy a drink or two,\n\nbut nobody's gonna drink a bottle of rubbing alcohol\n\nbecause we know that that would be toxic.\n\nThe same is true for methylmercury versus ethylmercury.\n\nOne of them can be harmful at a relatively low dose\n\nand the other one can be safe at a relatively low dose.\n\nSo thimerosal was used in several vaccines\n\nto prevent contamination, but thimerosal is not mercury.\n\nHowever, because of misunderstanding\n\nabout this chemical difference,\n\nmost vaccines ended up removing the thimerosal outright.\n\nThe only vaccines in the US\n\nthat even have thimerosal now are multi-dose flu vaccines,\n\nand those account for less than 7%\n\nof all flu vaccines being administered.\n\n@hellohcourtney asks,\n\nAnyone here of any alternative cancer treatments\n\nthat work?\n\nThere's a belief that scientists\n\nand healthcare providers are hiding natural treatments\n\nfor a variety of diseases including cancer.\n\nBut you might be surprised to know\n\nthat we actually often harness nature\n\nand improve upon it using science.\n\nToday we have many different pharmaceuticals\n\nthat target cancer\n\nthat are actually derived from natural chemicals,\n\nand we tweak them to improve their safety,\n\ntheir efficacy, or reduce side effects.\n\nFor example, a chemical called Podophyllotoxin,\n\nnatural chemical derived from the mayapple plant is used\n\nin pharmaceuticals or in medical treatments,\n\nbut we've also altered it chemically\n\nto create a chemical called etoposide.\n\nIt's better able to treat more cancer types\n\nand it has reduced side effects compared\n\nto the natural version.\n\nAnother example would be something like Paclitaxel,\n\na natural chemical from the yew tree,\n\nand we've altered it chemically\n\nto create a compound called docetaxel.\n\nDocetaxel is often used\n\nto treat certain cancers like breast cancer,\n\nprostate cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma,\n\nand certain types of head and neck cancer.\n\nAnd this is not something that's unique\n\nto cancer treatments either.\n\nAspirin, which chemically is called acetylsalicylic acid,\n\nis actually derived from a chemical found in willow bark.\n\nUnfortunately, people who opt for unproven treatments\n\nfor cancer have increased risk of poor outcomes.\n\nWhen you look at breast cancer survival,\n\nbreast cancer patients\n\nthat forego proven treatments have a 5.7 times increased\n\nrisk of death compared to patients\n\nthat use proven treatments.\n\n@JasonQ295178 wants to know,\n\nWhy are cancer rates in young people skyrocketing?\n\nThe good news is cancer rates\n\nin young people are not skyrocketing.\n\nUnfortunately, there've been a lot of headlines\n\nthat have said things to that effect,\n\nbut this really requires context.\n\nMost of the risk factors for cancers are things\n\nthat you actually can't control\n\nand they relate to your genetics,\n\nbut there are some that are impacted\n\nby modifiable risk factors.\n\nAnd so for many of these cancer rates are\n\nactually declining.\n\nWe're also seeing declines in cancer rates\n\nfor lung cancer because of public health measures\n\nand smoking cessation education campaigns.\n\nWe've seen a lot of headlines that have said\n\nthat colorectal cancer is increasing 1% year over year\n\nin people under 50,\n\nbut that is actually not the correct way to look at it.\n\nSo to illustrate this,\n\nthese are the colorectal cancer rates\n\nin the US by age group.\n\nAnd so colorectal cancer is the most common\n\nin older individuals compared to younger individuals,\n\nwhich is the case for nearly all cancers.\n\nCancers are by and large a disease of aging.\n\nSo the rate of cancer,\n\nthese are number of cases per 100,000 people.\n\nIn individuals for age 40 to 49,\n\nthere's a rate of 37 cases per a hundred thousand people.\n\nSo an increase in 1% means we've gone from 37 cases\n\nto 37.37 cases per a hundred thousand people.\n\nAnd when you look at the fact that there are\n\nabout 150,000 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed every year,\n\nthat means that we're seeing a few hundred total more cases\n\nin people under 50.\n\nPreviously, colonoscopy was recommended for individuals 50\n\nand above, but it's actually been reduced\n\nto individuals 45 and above.\n\nSo rates are a function of the ability to detect cancers.\n\nSo if we're screening more people\n\nwithin those younger age groups,\n\nwe're also going to find more cancers.\n\n@HarrisonHSmith says,\n\nWhen you see 'Citric Acid' on an ingredients list,\n\ndid you know that you're eating an extract\n\nof Black Mold patented by Pfizer?\n\nSo this is not true,\n\nbut it underscores misinformation about\n\nhow we manufacture citric acid.\n\nCitric acid is used in foods to give it a sour taste,\n\nso it's used in candies, but it's also used in seasonings\n\nand spices, pickles, ketchups, vinegars, mustard.\n\nIt gives everything that nice little sour flavor.\n\nEvery organism creates citric acid as part\n\nof their basic metabolic process.\n\nThat's why in the cell respiration pathway\n\nwe have the citric acid cycle.\n\nSo we harnessed this fundamental principle of all organisms\n\nand we use a specific species\n\nof fungi called aspergillus niger.\n\nWe grow up mold in really large containers\n\nand we give them molasses,\n\nand as they're metabolizing the molasses,\n\nthey're producing citric acid during the citric acid cycle,\n\nand so we harvest that citric acid from the liquid\n\nthat the mold is growing in and there's no mold in it.\n\nAspergillus niger is technically a black mold\n\nbecause it produces a pigment\n\nthat gives it a black coloring,\n\nbut the color of a mold has no bearing\n\non whether it's a harmful organism or not.\n\nAnd there's lots of black molds that exist,\n\nincluding many that we eat in foods every single day.\n\nTofu or soy sauce or koji.\n\nThese are all produced using black molds.\n\n@AGHuff wants to know, Does chronic Lyme disease exist?\n\nThis is a very controversial topic,\n\nand unfortunately, Lyme disease has actually been plagued\n\nwith controversy since it was first identified in the 1980s.\n\nLyme disease is an acute infection\n\nby bacteria called Borrelia burgdorfer\n\nthat are deposited into your skin through the bite\n\nof certain species of ticks that are infected with it.\n\nSo when you get Lyme disease, you take antibiotics such\n\nas doxycycline, which will eliminate the bacteria\n\nand clear the infection.\n\nThe phrase chronic Lyme disease is used in two contexts.\n\nThe first refers to symptoms\n\nthat may persist in a small proportion of people\n\nafter you finish that antibiotic treatment.\n\nThis is correctly termed post-treatment\n\nLyme disease syndrome,\n\nand it occurs in about three to 5% of people\n\nwith legitimate Lyme disease.\n\nAnd this has to do with the fact\n\nthat the bacteria may have caused some direct tissue damage\n\nand your immune system takes some time to return\n\nto baseline, so you may have some symptoms\n\nfor a period of time.\n\nThis is not unique to Lyme disease either.\n\nNearly every infection that we know of,\n\nthere's a small proportion of people\n\nthat may have lingering symptoms\n\nafter the infection is gone.\n\nContext two refers to a persistent infection\n\nthat is ongoing and is long term.\n\nThere are many organizations\n\nthat promote this unfounded theory,\n\nand what they do is they recommend\n\nand prescribe treatments that have no evidence\n\nand are potentially harmful,\n\nincluding long-term courses of antibiotics.\n\nNow, clinical trials have demonstrated\n\nthat there's no therapeutic benefit\n\nof extending antibiotic treatment\n\nfor this bacterial infection,\n\nyet people still prescribe these\n\nand this can lead to serious consequences like sepsis\n\nand opportunistic infections\n\nbecause you're taking antibiotics for too long.\n\nThey also promote a variety\n\nof unproven wellness interventions,\n\nthings like colloidal silver, bee venom therapy,\n\nurine therapy, enemas, herbal supplements,\n\nhormone treatments, metal chelation,\n\nand a variety of other interventions.\n\nNot only do these things have no evidence to support them\n\nfor any ailment, they certainly don't have evidence\n\nto support them for the treatment of a persistent infection\n\nthat does not exist.\n\nThis is why scientific expert agencies\n\nlike the CDC have revised their phrasing\n\nto discourage the use of the term chronic Lyme disease.\n\n@lods63 wants to know,\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Leaky Gut?\n\nIs it real? If so, what is the best way to address it?\n\nSo leaky gut sometimes called increased intestinal\n\npermeability is a diagnosis that is promoted by a lot\n\nof wellness influencers.\n\nLike all pseudoscience diagnoses has a little bit\n\nof truth behind it.\n\nSo there are certain legitimate gastrointestinal diseases\n\nlike celiac disease\n\nor ulcerative colitis where the pathology\n\nof the disease causes disruptions in\n\nhow your intestines function.\n\nBut wellness influencers have extrapolated that\n\nto tell people that your intestines\n\njust broadly become permeable\n\nand allow undigested food particles, toxins,\n\nand bacteria to get into your bloodstream\n\nand cause a really laundry list of symptoms.\n\nEverything from GI upset to brain fog and hair loss\n\nand weird food cravings.\n\nThere's no evidence to support this diagnosis\n\nand there's no evidence to support any of the tests\n\nand the treatments that these wellness influencers promote.\n\nThis is a hallmark of pseudoscience.\n\nThey create a medical condition that they can sell a test\n\nfor and then they can sell you the treatment for.\n\nDon't fall for it.\n\n@travelingenes says, Hey James Quincy,\n\nAs the CEO of @cocacola, did you allow your own children\n\nto grow up drinking Coca-Cola?\n\nOr is your preference\n\nthat only other people's kids be exposed\n\nto high fructose corn syrup, which is harmful effects\n\non the liver mirroring alcohol consumption?\n\nSo high fructose corn syrup is very poorly understood.\n\nSo what we do is we take the glucose\n\nthat's normally 100% of corn syrup\n\nand we take an enzyme called glucose isomerase\n\nand we convert about 50% of it\n\nto the other simple sugar fructose.\n\nSo now you have in high fructose corn syrup,\n\na mixture of about 50% fructose and 50% glucose.\n\nI bet you didn't know,\n\nbut that ratio of glucose to fructose is almost identical\n\nto the ratio of glucose to fructose in honey\n\nand the ratio of glucose to fructose\n\nin table sugar or cane sugar.\n\nHigh fructose corns syrup is not any worse than honey\n\nor any worse than sucrose or table sugar.\n\nThese are all just sugars.\n\nYour body views them and digests them\n\nand processes them essentially the same way.\n\nYour body needs sugars for optimal function,\n\nbut anything in excess, including sugar,\n\ncan be harmful at a high enough dose.\n\n@je_suis_belle1 asks, Why r people refusing to go\n\nthrough body scanners at the airport cause of radiation?!?\n\nDammit don't u have a cell phone?!!\n\nCell phones use radio frequency radiation\n\nand body scanners\n\nat the airport use millimeter wave radiation.\n\nNow when we're talking about radiation,\n\nradiation it all refers to different types of energy.\n\nThe type of radiation that body scanners\n\nand cell phones use are down in the radio frequency range.\n\nThese types of radiation waves are very long\n\nand have very low energy,\n\nwhich means that they're non-ionizing.\n\nSo when they interact with your body,\n\nthey're not able to actually cause any damage\n\nto your cells or your tissues.\n\nCell phones and body scanners don't contain types\n\nof radiation that are going to cause you harm.\n\nA lot of people confuse\n\nor are scared of the phrase radiation\n\nbecause we know that there are certain types of radiation,\n\nhigh energy radiation like gamma radiation\n\nthat can be ionizing.\n\nThese are high energy, they can cause damage,\n\nbut your radio frequency\n\nand your body scan radiation is very low energy.\n\n@suratybal wants to know,\n\nare underwire bra is still suspect as a cause\n\nfor breast cancer?\n\nDefinitely not.\n\nScientific experts have actually never suspected\n\nthat underwires are a cause for breast cancer.\n\nThe logic is that something tight around the lymph nodes\n\nand the breast tissue was leading to toxin accumulation,\n\nwhich was then causing breast cancer.\n\nThere's no scientific plausibility to this\n\nand it ignores basic concepts of physiology\n\nand how compounds and toxins and our lymphatic\n\nand cardiovascular or blood system actually works.\n\nNow, if you don't wanna wear a bra,\n\ndo you but don't omit wearing a bra\n\nbecause you've been told that it causes cancer.\n\n@LoriSmith1962 says, Carnivore diet is healthier\n\nfor humans and better\n\nfor the environment than being a vegan.\n\nSo this is just objectively false.\n\nThe carnivore diet is based on the premise\n\nthat you should only be consuming animal products.\n\nThat includes meat, animal fats and eggs,\n\nand this diet omits food groups\n\nand nutrients that we know are critical\n\nfor health, including fiber.\n\nCarnivore diet is nearly devoid of fiber,\n\nand fiber is essential for proper GI function.\n\nIt's also critical to help regulate levels of blood lipids,\n\nand it's also really important\n\nfor your overall immune system health.\n\nIf you are adhering to a diet that doesn't have fiber\n\nand doesn't have things like fruits\n\nand vegetables, you're running the risk\n\nof severe nutrient deficiency\n\nand adverse health effects,\n\nincluding increased risk of GI issues,\n\ncertain types of cancers and cardiovascular issues.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nRemember, false health information travels six times faster\n\nthan credible facts usually because it's scaring you\n\nand exacerbating your health fears.\n\nWe all can play a role in helping to combat\n\nand fact check health disinformation.\n\nThanks for watching Pseudoscience

                "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Mark Wood.\n\nI've been doing polar expeditions for over 20 years.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions.\n\nThis is Polar Exploration Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo Adrianjones28 asked,\n\nWhat was the most repulsive thing you had\n\nto eat on your expeditions?\n\nIt was rancid, a whale blubber,\n\nwhich is absolutely repulsive\n\nand just was really tough to chew through as well.\n\nAnd the people who gave it me\n\nwho knew me really well were smiling\n\n'cause they knew it tasted bad.\n\nWhen you chew it, it's like chewing on a car tire,\n\nbut it also stinks.\n\nSo TroyPSimpson asked,\n\nI've no idea why I'm watching videos\n\nabout what to do if I come face to face with a polar bear.\n\nWell, I've come face to face with a polar bear, Troy,\n\nand 300 meters away, right up close to my face.\n\nActually followed me for about three days.\n\nBut the moment that I started\n\nto feel my heart really beat\n\nwas when I actually could smell the bear.\n\nAnd that means the bear's really, really close.\n\nAnd I could hear him sort of grunting.\n\nSo this is the nose of the polar of bear.\n\nI was stood on some ice luckily,\n\nand he jumped up and sniffed my GoPro camera.\n\nTo give it perspective,\n\nhe was an arms distance away.\n\nSo he was this close away from me,\n\nwhich is too close in my world,\n\nand this is kind of what I was looking at.\n\nThe incredible strength within this jaw\n\nto rip an animal open was only at an arm's length away.\n\nIt's the first time that I've actually felt real danger.\n\nAnd you only feel tremendously alone\n\nwhen you feel you need somebody's help.\n\nAnd I had nobody else there.\n\nIt seemed like hours,\n\nbut it was seconds of looking at this bear\n\nand eventually he dropped down and just walked away.\n\nAnd at that point,\n\nI got this pen with the firework on the end\n\nand I pointed it at his feet\n\nand luckily it exploded in front of him,\n\nnot harming the bear,\n\nbut enough to scare him away and he ran off.\n\nBut for about two or three nights,\n\nI was still sticking my head out the tent\n\nlike a mere cat and looking around\n\nand making sure that he'd gone,\n\nand he had definitely gone, which was a massive relief.\n\nSo Seorisgf says,\n\nBro, where is the North Pole?\n\nActually there's five North Poles, let me show you.\n\nSo this is the top of the world and you've got Russia\n\nand you've got Canada and all the countries around.\n\nBut the blue bit in the center is the Arctic ocean.\n\nTo show you where the five North Poles are,\n\nI'm gonna use my trusty polar bear claw.\n\nYou've got the geographic North Pole,\n\nwhich is the very top of the planet where all of the lines\n\nof longitude pass through.\n\nThat's a fixed pole.\n\nThen you've got the pole of inaccessibility,\n\nwhich is on the Arctic Ocean itself.\n\nAgain, a fixed point,\n\nbut it's equidistance from any landmass around it,\n\nfrom Greenland to Canada to Russia, et cetera.\n\nThen you've got three other poles.\n\nOne of them is the Geomagnetic North Pole,\n\nwhich all geophysicists like,\n\nvery difficult word to say.\n\nAnd that's a moving pole.\n\nAnd currently it's going across the Canadian\n\nIsland of Ellesmere.\n\nThen you've got the magnetic North Pole,\n\nwhich I'm sure you've heard of.\n\nAnd that's going across the Canadian ocean side\n\nand it's crossing over to Russia.\n\nSo it's moving and moving over to Russian side.\n\nAnd that's really in the news at the moment\n\nbecause of its shift.\n\nAnd the final pole that you've got\n\nis actually in the air itself.\n\nIt's the point from Polaris to the North Pole,\n\nand it's a celestial pole.\n\nSo that's five North Poles.\n\nSo a great question\n\nor statement from Snakesl1,\n\nThe dudes that were involved in the heroic age\n\nof Arctic exploration were out of their freaking minds.\n\nSo the pioneer age of polar exploration\n\nwere really from the late 1800s onwards,\n\nright up to the point we reached the geographic north\n\nand geographic south poles,\n\nwhich were earlier on in the last century.\n\nAt that time, it was about discovery\n\nand mapping these areas.\n\nIn the days of Sir Ernest Shackleton\n\nand his men doing epic journeys across Antarctica,\n\nas some would say that they risked\n\ntheir lives for discovery,\n\nbut really it was pure survival.\n\nSo they weren't given a choice.\n\nThey went out there to do something\n\nthat no other humans had done before, which was so heroic.\n\nNowadays that wouldn't really happen\n\nbecause the communications we have,\n\nthe global communications, the satellite, et cetera,\n\nwould allow us to show the peril in real time\n\nso we could be rescued.\n\nR_mccallsburg has written,\n\nRead today that the Arctic Explorer has brought lard\n\nwith them since it's so calorific dense.\n\nDid they just eat it or what?\n\nThat's what the explorers used to do.\n\nNowadays we're a little bit more advanced\n\nin understanding nutrition,\n\nand this picture shows little packets of food\n\nthat I've decanted from the original packet.\n\nThere's actually about 100 packets of food\n\nand you've got main meals and also puddings,\n\nand that allows me also to put salami and butter and cheese\n\nand salt and everything else in there.\n\nAnd you wrap it up into a little ball.\n\nInstead of having a big carrier bag full of food each day,\n\nthere's actually two handfuls of food that you have.\n\nAnd inside there is apple and custard powder\n\nand that's what I eat as a pudding.\n\nYou've also got the main meals on this side,\n\nwhich can be a mixture of curries, stews,\n\npastas as well for different packets.\n\nSo you're not eating the same food all the time.\n\nI go and collect the snow or the ice\n\nand I melt it down, then boil it up,\n\nand then I pour this powder into a container\n\nand pour the boiling hot water into the container,\n\nmix it up, and then it expands.\n\nAnd that's what I eat.\n\nFull of protein, full of carbs,\n\nfull of everything you need to perform really well.\n\nAnderson Lemke asks a good question,\n\nWhat kind of cell phones do Arctic explorers use?\n\nWith cell phones, we can't use them\n\nin these extreme cold areas.\n\nWe use satellite phones\n\nand you can't use them as well like normal cell phones\n\nto look at the internet and to connect with friends\n\nor, say, call emergency services.\n\nWe use these to connect directly with the rescue services\n\nthat we've already connected with prior to the expedition.\n\nI can also connect with friends and family,\n\nbut I don't when I'm on extreme expeditions,\n\nand the reason being is it's too emotional for me.\n\nTo bring myself back into their world will drain\n\nmy sort of buildup of non-emotion\n\nthat I've got for the expedition.\n\nIt loses my focus for what I'm doing each day,\n\nwhich is pretty tough mentally.\n\nSo I don't need somebody that I love on the other end\n\nof the phone weakening that spirit, if you like.\n\nSo this is a question from Al Lowe.\n\nWhat's the difference between a North Pole\n\nand the South Pole?\n\nAll of the difference in the world, he says.\n\nSo from an explorer's perspective,\n\nthe Arctic Ocean or the North Pole\n\nis the toughest expedition\n\nthat you can do hands down.\n\nAntarctica itself being a continent,\n\nall you have to deal with is oncoming winds,\n\ntremendous cold, the loneliness of being out there,\n\nand sometimes crevasses,\n\nbut you generally know where the crevasses are.\n\nIn the North, it's like a zoo up there.\n\nThere's a varied amount of animals there.\n\nIf you move to Antarctica in the center\n\naround the South Pole,\n\nthere's no birds or anything like that.\n\nIt's just silence.\n\nSo Sara Bushway asks, Watching season seven of Alone.\n\nThey have to survive 100 days in the Arctic by themselves\n\nto win a million dollars.\n\nCould you do it?\n\nI'd love to win a million dollars with what I do.\n\nFor me personally, I work alone a lot.\n\nSo I'm known for solo work, working Antarctica,\n\nthe Arctic Circle, also on training expeditions as well.\n\nSo I've spent 50 days in Antarctica alone,\n\n30 days around the North Pole,\n\nanother 30 days in Norwegian High Arctic.\n\nGenerally I'm okay being alone.\n\nAnd the biggest is issue there is the mental status\n\nand strength that you require to do that.\n\nAnd I think experience gives you\n\nthe abilities to carry that out.\n\nAnd as you're going through a blank landscape,\n\nit gives you tremendous creativity in your mind\n\nto think about yourself as a human being,\n\nbut what direction you want to go in, in life as well.\n\nSo Be_the_spark has asked a serious question.\n\nOther than reindeer and the occasional polar bear,\n\nwhat kind of animals would live in Santa's North Pole?\n\nYou've got Arctic fox, Arctic hares,\n\nwhich are small animals.\n\nObviously you've also got caribou, which is a reindeer.\n\nAnd you've got mascot\n\nwhich are quite big animals, pack animals.\n\nAnd also you've got lemmings, very, very small.\n\nAnd the only real bird I can think of\n\nwould be the Arctic tern,\n\nwhich is in fact the longest migrating bird on the planet\n\nand can also be found in Antarctica as well.\n\nSo it goes all the way around the planet.\n\nIt's very rare,\n\nbut sometimes you do get interaction with these animals.\n\nSo AndyC_1 asks,\n\nWhich polar explorer do you have\n\nthe most admiration for and why?\n\nSo two big explorers,\n\nSir Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott\n\ndid epic expeditions in Antarctica,\n\nbut there was one person who has actually worked with them\n\nas like shadow of these two men.\n\nAnd it's an Irishman called Tom Crean\n\nand he was the workforce behind them\n\nand is known as the Unsung Hero of that age.\n\nSo it was in Tom Crean's nature to survive,\n\nbut also to look after the people he was with.\n\nSo he put his life in danger\n\nby actually rescuing his men, looking after Shackleton,\n\nbeing the forefront or the energy\n\nbehind making that expedition\n\nto the South Pole a success as in all the men survived.\n\nRudi Schuller asks,\n\nWhat do negative degree temperatures feel like?\n\nTo stand alone in minus 40, minus 50\n\nis a real tenseness on your body, almost claustrophobic,\n\nthat you can't get out of the situation.\n\nIt's a real horrible feeling\n\nthat you are engulfed in the cold.\n\nBut to survive in that moment, you need to do three things.\n\nOne is you need to make sure your body core\n\ntemperature is warm.\n\nSo by eating food is a real survival technique\n\nto warm yourself up from the inside.\n\nThe second thing is to wear the correct clothing.\n\nAnd that's something that will help you keep warm,\n\nbut also allow your body to breathe as you're moving\n\nso you don't create sweat on your body,\n\n'cause if you create sweat, then when you stop,\n\nthat will turn to ice or clinging onto your heart\n\nand your lungs and can give you hypothermia.\n\nAnd then the third thing is movement.\n\nSo as long as you can move, keep moving,\n\nkeep the blood blowing\n\naround the body away from the extremities\n\nso you don't get frostbite,\n\nthen your body can function and you can progress.\n\nSo inside the tent itself at night,\n\nit's the same temperature as outside the tent.\n\nYou've got a little protection from the wind, which is good,\n\nbut you can be minus 35 with inside the tent,\n\nwhich is colder than your freezers at home.\n\nBut any explorer, any adventurer that you ever meet\n\nand you say the sound of the cooker is...\n\nAs soon as you start hearing that sound,\n\nyour brain starts getting happy\n\nbecause your body starts warming up.\n\nAnd it's amazing to feel\n\nthat initial heat coming off the cooker\n\nwhere you start stripping your clothes down\n\nand you can actually be in base layers inside your tent\n\nas a tent heats up.\n\nSo MaidenSlate asks,\n\nCurious, how would you envision medical care\n\nin remote and rural areas?\n\nAnd I am self-sufficient, so I need to, first of all,\n\nbe trained in medical care myself.\n\nIn Antarctica, as I started to move towards\n\nthe South Pole over 50 days,\n\nI had a problem with my boot.\n\nIt wasn't fitting very well with my skis,\n\nso I had a little bit of movement inside with my foot.\n\nAnd over a few days, it started to heat up\n\nand one day I took my foot out\n\nand I found that the base of my foot, the skin had come off,\n\na massive amount of skin had come off\n\nand you just had the rawness of the skin underneath.\n\nAnd I was in a lot of agony.\n\nSo what I did at night was I cut the skin off\n\nand because skin's got protein in it,\n\nI ate the skin.\n\nI didn't eat the skin.\n\nThat's a joke by the way.\n\nI took the skin off.\n\nAfter a few days, it actually dried off\n\nbecause Antarctica is a dry desert.\n\nIf you expose the foot to the dryness,\n\nit dries really, really quickly.\n\nSo the environment actually saved the day for me.\n\nSo this is from originalHRN.\n\nI think I need a career change.\n\nI wonder how one becomes an Arctic explorer?\n\nI think you just need to find where your passion lies\n\nand what you want to do and just take steps from there.\n\nThe word explorer is quite a contentious word\n\nin this modern era.\n\nI've been asked whether I can actually call myself that.\n\nWell, after 35 plus expeditions in the polar regions,\n\nI feel I have a right to say that.\n\nAnd also it excites children when I come into schools\n\nto give talks that they know\n\nthat have got an explorer coming in.\n\nReally the explorers that I recognize,\n\nthese guys in the past,\n\nthe pioneers who discovered areas on the planet,\n\nand in space, they are the pioneer explorers of the past.\n\nThe key point is you've got to have the desire\n\nto go out there because the environment is so claustrophobic\n\nand unpredictable that you've got to have the real need\n\nto go out there and operate.\n\nSo you've got to consider that to begin with.\n\nSo my suggestion would be to go out\n\nand experience the environment to begin with\n\nand then to decide how you want to operate out there.\n\nLimelacowboy, I love polar exploration\n\nbecause where else are you going to find\n\nthis many people excited to discover a guy\n\nwho got cannibalized 180 years ago.\n\nThat's a good statement.\n\nAnd yeah, people are excited about\n\nthe mac carb, aren't they?\n\nA 100 or so years ago in the days of Sir John Franklin\n\nand his men who perished along the Northwest Passage\n\nin High Arctic Canada weren't discovered\n\nuntil recent times as ships were,\n\nbut all of the men died on ice.\n\nThere was talks of cannibalism as well,\n\nand this is the human nature at its rawest.\n\nAnd really the only reason we know about this\n\nis because of the diaries left behind\n\nand the historic value of the whole expedition itself.\n\nAnd that just shows how harsh these guys were living.\n\nIf you have to resort to something like that,\n\nit's just hell on earth.\n\nSo Orionis has asked, How to travel to the Arctic?\n\nYou can pull sledges like I do, carry everything with you.\n\nYou can go on snowmobiles with teams,\n\nyou can also go on dog teams, which I love doing in Alaska.\n\nI've worked with really good dog teams out there\n\ncalled Squid Dog Acres.\n\nSo these little blue bits of material are actually booties\n\nfor dogs to put on their feet.\n\nSo these dogs have actually running these.\n\nThis was one of the main transports back in the day\n\nfor dog teams to transport humans across the ice.\n\nAnd it's still used today in High Arctic areas,\n\nbut not in Antarctica.\n\nThey're not allowed dogs in Antarctica anymore\n\n'cause it's unnatural for dogs to be there.\n\nBut it is a main source of transport for the polar regions.\n\nSo aside from pulling sledges,\n\nwe also wear skis and we go back country skiing.\n\nSo we have the bindings which not are attached\n\nto the ski itself with the whole foot,\n\nit's just attached by the toe.\n\nIt allows you to pivot and push the ski along.\n\nSo we do this as we're pulling the sledges along.\n\nIt allows us to propel ourselves a greater distance\n\nusing less energy.\n\nSo I do extreme expeditions,\n\nbut the polar regions are accessible to anybody\n\nto go and venture into.\n\nYou just need to travel with the right company.\n\nDevan Flaherty has asked me about the third man factor.\n\nHas anybody ever experienced the third man factor?\n\nWhen I did the South Pole,\n\nI crossed there for 50 days without any music,\n\nanything to stimulate my brain.\n\nBut after a while,\n\nas I started to approach the South Pole itself,\n\nit's on a plateau of 3,000 meters\n\nand I started to push up this plateau\n\nand I was in quite a bit of pain.\n\nMy body was folding a little bit.\n\nI was really pushing against the wind\n\nas I was going forward.\n\nSo it was an horrendous time for me.\n\nAnd at that point, I felt an arm around my shoulder.\n\nI was alone.\n\nI felt somebody gripping onto my shoulder\n\nand somebody leaning into me\n\nwhispering words of encouragement,\n\nKeep going, keep going, keep going.\n\nAnd that allowed me to almost be quite zen.\n\nAnd even though I felt really relaxed\n\nas I was pushing forward, my mind was clearer,\n\nmy body was still probably struggling\n\nbut I didn't feel it inside and it felt great.\n\nAnd that happened about six\n\nor seven times on that expedition.\n\nAnd when I called for it, it never happened.\n\nWhen I got back to Canada,\n\nI spoke to a great explorer up there\n\nand said this is what happened\n\n'cause I was a little bit embarrassed as well.\n\nAnd he said that it happened\n\nto him on the way back from the North Pole when they tried\n\nto find this food area which they'd laid out on ice,\n\nthey'd lost it.\n\nSo they did a pattern search\n\nand something was telling him to go over towards the left.\n\nAnd as he walked 100 yards,\n\nhe found the food in the ice.\n\nI'm sure scientists would say that you are a lowest ebb\n\nand your mind was thinking that you had no other choice\n\nand I needed support.\n\nSo it manifested this support that I required.\n\nMy mom died 10 years prior to that.\n\nSo I could easily relate it to maybe it's the spirit\n\nof my mother coming through.\n\nAnd a lot of people might do that\n\nand I wouldn't smile at that or joke about it.\n\nIt's one of the two,.\n\nI'd like to think it's my mom, but who knows?\n\nSo Seetheuniverse has asked,\n\nIf you could bring one animal back from the North Pole\n\nto be a pet, what would you choose and why?\n\nAnd the bad news they're giving me\n\nis penguins don't live in the North.\n\nThanks for that. I didn't really know that.\n\nIf you are asking me what's my favorite animal\n\nand maybe a cuddly toy version of it,\n\nthen I would definitely bring back a lemming\n\n'cause it's very small, it's very cute,\n\nand it's very easy to hide away in my house away from people\n\nwho think a 58-year-old man shouldn't have a teddy bear.\n\nSo Licensedclown asks,\n\nWhat if I went to work in the Arctic?\n\nI feel like that would be cool.\n\nIt would be.\n\nHow many people can say they did that?\n\nI can talk about the Canadian High Arctic,\n\nwhich is probably half the size of Europe\n\nwith a human population of about 500 people.\n\nThere's two settlements, Greece Fjord and Resolute Bay,\n\nwhich have about 270 to 300 people in.\n\nAnd then there's a few research centers\n\naround a vast area which makes the numbers\n\nup to between four and 500 people.\n\nHowever, there's also polar bears roaming around that area.\n\nSo the polar bear population\n\nreally outweighs the human population.\n\nSo Quora asks, How does one prepare\n\nfor an expiration to the Arctic?\n\nAnd I think that to answer this, it's in preparation.\n\nThere's many things you have to pack for a polar expedition.\n\nBut the top five things\n\nthat I would recommend are these.\n\nA sleeping bag is essential for a good night's sleep.\n\nSleep is so important to how you perform the next day.\n\nA great tent, you need something which will withstand storms\n\nand keep you protected from the wind.\n\nA great cooker, something which will be reliable\n\nthrough the 50/100 days.\n\nAnd then the fourth thing is your navigation.\n\nAnd the final thing is if I was gonna drop all four of those\n\nand just pick one thing, it would be a location beacon.\n\nAnd if we don't take that with us, I think it's four highly.\n\nSo to take a navigational system with you to track\n\nwhere you are going and then to press it in your hour\n\nof need is so important\n\nbecause the success of an expedition\n\nis coming home safe and sound.\n\nI don't really take books or anything like that\n\n'cause they're too heavy.\n\nI take a little iPod with me with music on it\n\nand some podcasts on there as well.\n\nBut also I take a Dictaphone\n\n'cause I'm not great at writing things down\n\nas the pioneers used to do like great diaries.\n\nSo I actually sew it into my sleeping bag\n\nand at night when I've had something to eat\n\nand I'm nice and warm, tucked in my sleeping bag,\n\nand it's the winds blown outside\n\nand it's tremendously cold,\n\nI can sit in my sleeping bag and talk about the day\n\nand talk about how I feel, which I think is really important\n\nfor people to listen to.\n\nWhat are your biggest fears?\n\nThe cold, the natural predators, or the isolation?\n\nWhat draws humans to visit the Arctic\n\nand how can one visit the great north\n\nand leave it untouched?\n\nFor me, the biggest fear on exploration isn't polar bears,\n\nisn't the cold, it's the fear of giving in.\n\nIt's the fear of that moment\n\nwhere you find a weakness within your body and your heart\n\nand you say, I can't go on.\n\nAnd the trigger that keeps you going\n\nis the fact you truly believe in what you're doing,\n\nand also you have the mental knowledge to know\n\nthat it will get better.\n\nYou will progress\n\nand you will get to your destination in the end.\n\nSo when I was in Antarctica,\n\nthe plane did disappear and I was left on my own\n\nand I knew I had 50 days in front of me\n\nto reach the Geographic South Pole.\n\nI'd spent three years preparing for this\n\nand telling everybody I was gonna do it.\n\nSo I had a the weight of the world, if you like,\n\nupon my shoulders as I moved forward.\n\nBut five days into the journey,\n\nI lost a key element to my expedition, which was my music.\n\nLittle iPod that I took with me, I lost it in the ice.\n\nAnd yes, it was a white iPod that I lost.\n\nSo I had absolutely nothing to think about,\n\nbut my own thoughts and the silence\n\nand looking around 360 of nothing actually played on my mind\n\nto the point where I pitched my tent middle of the day\n\nand I sat in it and I thought, I can't do this anymore.\n\nThis was five days into the journey\n\nand I spent 36 hours in that tent just going through my mind\n\nof giving in, giving in, giving in all the time.\n\nI know I'm an older man, but I can be honest to you\n\nand say that I cried and I judge myself\n\nand what I was doing.\n\nAnd at that point, I got on my satellite phone,\n\nI phoned my friend back in the UK who knew me really well\n\nand I said, I want to give in.\n\nAnd he talked me through what was wrong,\n\nhow I could process things.\n\nHe talked me back on my feet\n\nbut he didn't make me move my feet.\n\nSo I packed everything away.\n\nThen I stood looking at the path in front of me\n\nand I just put one foot in front of the other,\n\none foot in front of the other,\n\nkept on doing that for another 1,000 feet.\n\nAnd that's how I reached the South Pole\n\nby just basically moving myself in the right direction.\n\nRemember_Sarah asks a good question.\n\nHow was the golden age of Arctic exploration possible\n\nbefore Hot Hands, which is what I want to know.\n\nHot Hands is like a pad that you can have in your hand,\n\nyou break it and it warms up your hands.\n\nThey're great if you're go skiing\n\nor if you are doing stuff like operating cameras\n\nand things like that.\n\nBut for what I do, I try not to use artificial heat.\n\nIt's a very short term thing.\n\nIt feels great at the time, then that's taken away\n\nand I'm back to being cold again.\n\nIt helps in in sense of emergencies,\n\nbut I don't generally use them just to warm myself up.\n\nYou've got to remember they didn't have these pads,\n\nbut what they did bring on their ships\n\nwere things like musical instruments,\n\nlike pianos and guitars and they have bottles of whiskey\n\nand wine and rum and all these different foods on the ship.\n\nAnd then they transported that to the ice\n\nand they took a lot of heavy equipment along with them.\n\nSo even though they didn't have the comfort of Hot Hands,\n\nthey had the comfort of other things that we take\n\nfor granted in normal life.\n\nSo TamsynVR asks, How cold is it right now?\n\nDo we need to dress like Arctic explorers?\n\nSo you don't just put big jackets on.\n\nYou have very, very thin layers that you wear\n\nthat are breathable, that trap air.\n\nAnd you can have two or three of those on\n\ndepending on how cold you are.\n\nAnd then you have a mid layer on top.\n\nAnd then if you are really, really cold,\n\nlike if you're static\n\nand not using your body to generate heat,\n\nthen you can put a big down jacket on,\n\nzip it right up with your hat and everything\n\nto keep me nice and warm.\n\nBut it all depends on what you're doing.\n\nIf you are moving, then your body will generate heat.\n\nIf you're static, then you will release heat from your body\n\nso you need to contain it.\n\nWhen you're in a tent at night\n\nand you're about to get into your minus 40 sleeping bags,\n\nso really great sleeping bags you need.\n\nThe mistake a lot of people make\n\nis they think, I'm really cold,\n\nso they wear all their jackets and everything\n\nand they get into the sleeping bag and they start to freeze.\n\nAnd the reason for that\n\nis because the sleeping bag is designed\n\nto contain the heat of the body.\n\nSo you heat up the bag, the bag doesn't heat up you.\n\nSo to wear less clothing in a sleeping bag\n\nis the important thing to do.\n\nWhat I do is I get into my sleeping bag\n\nand when it's freezing cold, I do a little jog.\n\nI move around quite a lot and I generate a lot of heat.\n\nThen I put the bag up, zip it up,\n\nand all that heat is then dispersed inside the bag.\n\nAnd that's how you keep warm.\n\nSo this is from Walter.\n\nHow our igloos built and how do they keep you warm?\n\nIgloos are built in igloo shape\n\nbecause it gives strength to the structure.\n\nIf it just had walls, then it'd be difficult\n\nto build a structured roof to it.\n\nAlso the ice that is used\n\nhas got very little water content.\n\nSo if you try to get the ice\n\nand scratch it up like a snowball,\n\nthen it would just flake away in your hands\n\n'cause it hasn't got anything to bind it together.\n\nSo that's why you cut bricks to build an igloo\n\nbecause it's more structural,\n\na bit like polystyrene if you like.\n\nThe igloos will keep you sheltered from the wind\n\nand you can actually light a fire inside\n\nor put your cooker on\n\nand that will then contain the heat inside.\n\nThe only technical thing you need to know about\n\nis how those fumes are released outside.\n\nIf it's sealed, you can actually succumb to the fumes.\n\nSo Romanticspiral, Walking to work today in a stormy\n\nwinter weather made me realize\n\nI have zero survival instincts.\n\nDrop me alone in the middle of the Arctic\n\nand I will give up within a day.\n\nIf the average person was dropped into the same area\n\nthat I operate in,\n\nit would be a rapid decrease in the mental\n\nand physical state.\n\nThere is a thing called Arctic shock,\n\nand that's the reality of where you are.\n\nThe coldness, that engulfed shoe,\n\nthe wind that whips around you,\n\nthe realization that you're not gonna be able\n\nto go into a building for the next two\n\nto three weeks can be quite intense on you.\n\nSo Arctic shock kicks in\n\nand basically that means that your body's telling you\n\nto give in at a very, very early stage.\n\nSo failure would be very, very quick for them\n\nunless you have that backing of experience.\n\nSo Simplebeauty asks,\n\nSo we're not gonna talk about Antarctica melting?\n\nWell, I've actually bought in some ice,\n\nwhich is over the course of 12 years from Antarctica\n\nand from the Arctic circle as well.\n\nSo this is ice from the Geographic North Pole,\n\nand this is ice from the Geographic South Pole.\n\nIn Antarctica, the ice is melting so fast\n\nand it's one of the most rapidly\n\nheating places on the planet.\n\nSo, so much research is being taken out there\n\nwith different teams from around the world.\n\nAnd when it comes round to the Arctic circle,\n\nbecause it's an ocean,\n\nobviously there's very, very different patterns there.\n\nBut with the Arctic, it's very, very different altogether\n\nbecause it's an ocean with land masses around it like Russia\n\nand Canada and places like that.\n\nSo you've got ice crossing all the way from Russia\n\nall the way to Canada,\n\nbut that ice is depleting.\n\nAd as the ice melts, the sea level rise.\n\nBut how does that work?\n\nBecause in ice cube in a glass, if the ice melts,\n\nit stays the same level,\n\nbut because the ice is so vast,\n\nit's got its own gravitational pull\n\nand it draws in water from all oceans\n\nfrom around the planet.\n\nAnd as it gets to the top of the world,\n\nit freezes and that's why you get this beautiful ice\n\nmass on top of the planet.\n\nBut because the world is heating up,\n\nthis ice is melting\n\nand it's now dispersing the water back around the planet\n\nso sea levels rise,\n\nand that's an explanation of what's happening at both poles.\n\nTo the naked eye, this looks very, very clear at both poles,\n\nbut in the Antarctic one, you've got ice,\n\nwhich is sat on top of land mass.\n\nSo it's pure ice sat on top of there in a pure area.\n\nAnd on this one, you've got ice from the ocean,\n\nthe Arctic ocean.\n\nSo I would imagine it's got salt content\n\nwithin this one though I haven't tested it,\n\nbut they are very, very different in their content.\n\nHetch Silence says, How do we make fire in the snow?\n\nWell, in my world as an explorer, I don't make fires.\n\nWe haven't got any trees, we've got nothing to burn.\n\nIt'd be wrong of me to burn anything\n\nout there anyway environmentally.\n\nSo what I use to heat up my food is a little cooker\n\nand we use fuel and we light that\n\nand it sets off the heat for the food,\n\nbut also heat for the tent as well.\n\nSo it warms me up at the same time and I go out\n\nand collect snow and ice and I melt that down, boil it up,\n\nand that's what I add to my food.\n\nSo actually the heater is a main source of survival.\n\nQuora writes, What was your most\n\nunexpected Arctic experience?\n\nOne of the most memorable was you expect\n\nto see a polar bear in the Arctic,\n\nbut one day a little lemming just decided\n\nto walk into the tent and it was a total shock.\n\nA lemming is a little rodent\n\nand he just walked in like it...\n\nWell, it was his home.\n\nI took some photographs and didn't touch him at all.\n\nAnd then he walked out and as I saw him walk out,\n\nhe sort of walked off into the ice\n\nand then just disappeared over a little bit of ice,\n\nand I thought, how does he survive in this wilderness?\n\nSo those are all the questions.\n\nThank you very much for them.\n\nIt's made me think about who I'm as an explorer,\n\nit's put me on my back foot.\n\nYou've occasionally made me smile as well.\n\nSo thanks for watching Polar Explorer Support.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWhat a weekend of action in Europe's top soccer leagues! The Premier League's title race feels like it's taken a decisive turn thanks to Liverpool's 2-0 win at Manchester City and Arsenal's 1-0 home defeat to West Ham. Real Madrid and Barcelona picked up wins to share top spot in LaLiga, with Atletico Madrid just one point behind.\n\nIn Serie A, Napoli's latest misstep -- this time at Como -- drops them out of first place as Inter Milan won 1-0 at home to Genoa. Elsewhere, there were talking points galore around Arsenal's lack of firepower, Vincent Kompany's brave coaching in Bayern Munich's big win, and Man United's continued slide.\n\nHere are musings and reactions to the most memorable moments of the weekend.\n\nLiverpool take a giant step toward the title as Man City and Pep Guardiola search for answers\n\nI don't think Liverpool have quite wrapped up the Premier League. My rule of thumb is that when the points lead is greater than the number of games remaining -- net of head-to-head clashes -- you can feel pretty good about yourself. We're not there yet. If Arsenal win their game-in-hand and the six-pointer at Anfield on May 10, maybe Liverpool won't win their first title in 30-plus years in front of their own fans (given that the last one was won during the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nIf that happens, Arsenal would have to make up five points in 10 games, which is difficult -- especially with Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka out -- but not impossible. The problem: that's a ton of \"ifs.\" You really have to convince yourself that Mikel Arteta's side is going to magically improve and that fatigue and injuries are going to catch up with Liverpool. So yeah, Arne Slot's title in his debut season is pretty darn close.\n\nBut more than the numbers, it's the vibe Liverpool give off that makes you confident, and it was evident in the 2-0 win at Manchester City. Here, Slot deserves a ton of credit.\n\nComing off two draws, and two games in which they looked a bit leggy, he redesigned the team, dropping a forward and adding Curtis Jones to a de facto 4-2-2-2, with Luis D\u00edaz and Mohamed Salah starting wide. Jones effectively formed the \"box\" midfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai alongside him, and the Ryan Gravenberch-Alexis Mac Allister tandem shielded the back four. The result was a ton of sterile possession for City, a better foothold in midfield for Liverpool and an easier time protecting Trent Alexander-Arnold whenever J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku dribbled past him, which was often.\n\nI'm not big on body language, but the calm Virgil van Dijk & Co. exuded at the back as City turned their 66% possession into a measly 0.65 expected goals told you all you needed to know.\n\nSlot outcoached Pep Guardiola on the day, and it's a credit to him. But take a step back and, as I've written in the past, you get a better sense of his achievement.\n\nplay 2:25 How Arne Slot outcoached Pep Guardiola in Liverpool's win Janusz Michallik reacts to Liverpool's 2-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League.\n\nHe had never worked outside of the Netherlands. He was replacing a club legend in Jurgen Klopp. His one summer signing -- Federico Chiesa -- has played 28 minutes of league football this season. He changed the formation to a base 4-2-3-1. He changed the approach from Klopp's percussive press to a more pragmatic and flexible style. He transformed a promising (if erratic) 22-year-old with 12 Premier League starts under his belt, Gravenberch, into a deep-lying playmaker and a model of consistency. Oh, and he did all this with three of his biggest stars -- Van Dijk, Alexander-Arnold and, of course, Salah -- on the brink of free agency.\n\nDon't be surprised if Liverpool hit a road bump between now and the end of the campaign. He has rotated relatively little in key areas -- fatigue was a component in their last two draws and, you imagine, some guys who have been overperforming will come back to earth. But ... so what? He's on the verge of winning the title, he's in the League Cup final and he dominated the Champions League group stage.\n\nAs for Manchester City, you can't fault Guardiola, who's clearly still looking for answers and trying solutions. The enforced absences of John Stones and Erling Haaland weighed heavy for different reasons. When three of your back four is made up of Rico Lewis, Abdukodir Khusanov and Nathan Ak\u00e9 -- at least in their current iteration -- it's going to be a rough ride. When Haaland is out, you have to redesign your entire attacking scheme, because whether it's Omar Marmoush or Phil Foden, their skill sets will be totally different. Jeremy Doku, making his first start in more than a month, did his job out wide, but there were no answers coming through the middle.\n\nplay 1:53 Is the future bright for Man City after loss to Liverpool? Frank Leboeuf reacts to Pep Guardiola's assertion that Man City's future is bright with its young players after a loss to Liverpool.\n\nBack-to-back comprehensive defeats -- this one and the one at the Bernabeu in midweek -- can have a lasting impact and further the sense of drift in this team. Guardiola can't let this happen. Stress and pressure led him to twice try to walk away when he was at Barcelona -- when they were winning everything in sight and he had a guy named Lionel Messi working for him -- that's unlikely to happen now. But he needs help, if only in terms of the messaging coming from the club. City have plenty to play for and things can go south very quickly.\n\nFour games without a win and Napoli slip to second, not just for the reasons you think\n\nSunday's 2-1 defeat at Como means Inter leapfrog Napoli at the top of Serie A and Antonio Conte was glum postmatch, blaming \"mentality.\" Three points out of 12 from your past four games, when you're not playing midweek, is a major slide if you're trying to win the title.\n\nThe narrative out there is that Napoli are paying the price for the departure of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January, and the fact that he wasn't replaced (or replaced by Noah Okafor, which is kind of the same thing, since Conte gave him only 11 minutes on the pitch). There's something to that. Obviously, they're better with Kvaratskhelia than without him, especially in light of David Neres' injury: Had Kvara stuck around, Conte might have kept the 4-3-3 rather than shifting to the 3-5-2.\n\nBut that's also a bit simplistic. Kvaratskhelia hadn't scored for Napoli since October, and his last appearance was in December; Napoli's poor results didn't begin until February. Some of this, certainly Sunday, is on Conte. When you leave Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa on the bench because he's a booking away from being suspended and you don't want him to miss the big clash with Inter next week, replacing him with Philip Billing, you're not just getting a drop in quality -- you're getting a totally different player. More broadly, this is a team that just doesn't create very much. They rank seventh in Expected Goals and the patterns-of-play-plus-physicality mantra that Conte preaches isn't as productive as it once was.\n\nplay 2:28 How Napoli's recent struggles affect the Serie A title race Gab Marcotti breaks down Napoli's latest loss and how it impacts the standings at the top of Serie A.\n\nThe scudetto is by no means gone, and next week against Inter will be huge. But maybe it's time to tweak the way Napoli play: less reliance on Romelu Lukaku (who hasn't been up to par of late), less confidence on outmuscling opponents, more creativity. He has the time to work on it on the training pitch and the skills to make it happen. What he -- and Napoli -- don't need are more excuses.\n\nI hate to say 'I told you so' when it comes to Arsenal and forwards, but ...\n\nMikel Arteta took responsibility for Saturday's 1-0 home defeat to West Ham and said he was \"very, very angry.\" It's nice to see accountability, but maybe more than responsibility for the performance on Saturday -- it wasn't good: witness the number of times West Ham broke in transition and the fact they managed just two shots on target -- he should take a look at how this team was built. I had no problem with Havertz as center-forward -- some wanted a \u00a380m juggernaut up front, but that was just unrealistic -- but the issue is the lack of alternatives. And now that Havertz is out for the season (as is Gabriel Jesus, who is not a viable alternative as a central striker, but at least has played there before), the proverbial chickens have come home to roost.\n\nGoing into the campaign without an insurance policy was evidently a mistake. Not bringing in someone in January, even on loan if you don't want to (or can't spend money) is doubling down on that mistake. Evan Ferguson, Mathys Tel, Randal Kolo Muani and \u00c1lvaro Morata ... heck, even Chuba Akpom and Christian Kouam\u00e9 all moved on loan in January, which means they were all in play for Arsenal. Not to start necessarily, just to have an option. They're not all necessarily good, but they all know how to play center-forward. But, no. And then Havertz -- who had started virtually every game this season -- gets hurt and you are where you are.\n\nplay 1:43 Laurens: There's no way back for Arsenal in the title race Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens debate whether the Premier League title race is over as Liverpool's lead extends to 11 points.\n\nAnd then Mikel Merino comes off the bench against Leicester, you stick him up front, he scores twice and presto! He's the new center-forward. Except he isn't, as we saw on Saturday. Nor can you conjure up some sophisticated \"false nine\" system: no, merely putting a midfielder up front does not make him a \"false nine\" because fixtures come thick and fast.\n\nI don't want to sound too harsh. Arsenal will likely finish second, they have a young team, there's more to come and yes, if Saka weren't out too you would have papered over some of those cracks. What's frustrating is that this situation was so avoidable.\n\nLuka Modric keeps Real Madrid ticking ... and David Alaba is back\n\nAll eyes were on Real Madrid given that they'd dropped points after midweek wins in each of the past three weekends and, of course, they recorded another big midweek victory against Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League last Wednesday. Manager Carlo Ancelotti wheeled out a de facto 4-2-4 formation -- Vin\u00edcius and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 up front, Brahim D\u00edaz and Rodrygo wide -- against Girona, and handed the keys of the midfield to Luka Modric.\n\nWise choice. Despite Real Madrid's dominance, things were starting to get a tiny bit nervy as halftime approached, and so it was the 39-year-old who uncorked a long-range sizzler to break the ice, before Vinicius added a second. This game was actually far more one-sided than the 2-0 scoreline suggests, and it felt like Mbappe and Vini could each have had a couple of goals more.\n\nplay 2:10 Hislop: Real Madrid's quality was the difference vs. Girona Shaka Hislop reacts to Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Girona in LaLiga and talks about Kylian Mbappe's performance.\n\nIt helped too that David Alaba was able to make his first league start since 2023, playing 72 minutes at a good level. I don't know if we'll see the Alaba of old -- it will take more time, though at 32, he's by no means done -- but in the meantime his presence not only allows Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni to return to midfield where he belongs, but also gives Antonio R\u00fcdiger a much needed breather.\n\nWith Alaba part of the defensive corps, Ancelotti has options at every role in the back four: Asencio, Lucas V\u00e1zquez and (my choice) Fede Valverde at right-back, Rudiger, Alaba, Asencio and (reluctantly) Tchouameni at center-back, Fran Garc\u00eda and Ferland Mendy at left-back. He can now pick on form and fit, rather than merely on whether a particular player is capable of standing upright.\n\nQUICK HITS\n\n10. Wild-card Dani Olmo delivers three big points for Barcelona: His last LaLiga goal was in early November and his last start was in mid-December, which may lead some to wonder whether the expense -- and the nonsense with his registration -- was worth it, particularly with Gavi and Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez hanging around. But Olmo showed he can be valuable to Barcelona, opening the scoring against Las Palmas (Ferran Torres would add a second in garbage time) in a game that proved to be tighter than some had anticipated. He started the move and after an exchange with Lamine Yamal, he finished it with some nifty footwork. Hansi Flick made four changes with the huge Copa del Rey semifinal against Atletico in midweek and, maybe, some were looking past Las Palmas. In situations like these, a guy like Olmo is invaluable. I wouldn't have spent all that money on him (especially given Barca's situation), but this is what he can do, perhaps better than any Barca player off the bench.\n\nGAB & JULS PODCAST Gabriele Marcotti and Julien Laurens dive into the latest news and gossip, analyze matches with special guests, and give their perspective on the world of football. Stream now\n\n9. The Martinez boys deliver gritty three points for Inter vs. Genoa: Josep Mart\u00ednez, filling in for the injured Yann Sommer, came up with some big saves against Patrick Vieira's well-organised and intense Genoa. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez showed, again, how his presence in this team is really nonnegotiable, notching the only (deflected) goal in a tight game. Simone Inzaghi loves his rotation and if most of his team is still able-bodied at this stage of the season, it probably has a lot to do with it. But there's an evident gulf between the difference-makers (Fede Dimarco, Alessandro Bastoni, Nicolo Barella, Hakan Calhanoglu, Lautaro Martinez) and almost everybody else. Rotation is great and important in the modern game, but it's usually your big players who get you out of jams.\n\n8. No signs of Bayer Leverkusen slowdown after January refresh: Xabi Alonso basically acquired five new players in January. Two were loan signings (Emi Buendia, Mario Hermoso) and three were incumbents returning after long injuries (Amine Adli, Victor Boniface, Jonas Hofmann). The first two aren't necessarily world-beaters -- neither could hold down a starting place at Aston Villa or Roma -- and Leverkusen were doing just fine without the latter trio (Adli went down in October, the other two in November). But taken as a group, five new faces at training is a jolt to the system. Some coaches preach stability and don't want midseason intrusions unless absolutely necessary, especially on teams that are doing well. Alonso evidently doesn't see it that way. He presumably knows that everyone is going to contribute, but you can leverage their enthusiasm and desire at this stage of the campaign.

Vincent Kompany's bravery pays off as Bayern enjoy statement win: He's had his critics and we all know he wasn't high on the club's list to replace Thomas Tuchel, but Kompany showed plenty of personality and boldness on Sunday for the visit of Eintracht Frankfurt. After the humiliating home draw with Celtic in the Champions League, Kompany had the guts to drop Alphonso Davies and Harry Kane against Eintracht (who may have been on a run but were still third in the table). Don't be fooled by the late goals in the 4-0 win: this was a comprehensive and convincing victory (the xG of 3.89 to 0.53 tells its own story) and he had the confidence to keep going even when it was still 0-0 in first-half injury time and he had to take off the injured Joshua Kimmich. Bayern may not often pass the eye test this season but being eight points clear with a rookie (at this level) coach and a number of contractual issues to resolve is not something to dismiss.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines.

I wasn't overly impressed by his goals total at Manchester City (19 in all competitions, which he has already equalled). They were a dominant team, Bernardo Silva and Kevin De Bruyne were the ones feeding you possession, you had Erling Haaland drawing the attention of the opponent. Nor did his World Cup exploits move the needle for me; yes, he came up big, but it's only a couple of games and he was alongside that Lionel Messi fella, who is pretty good. Nice player, but not enough to justify the \u20ac85 million Atletico shelled out. (In my defense, I'm in good company: I'm pretty sure Guardiola was a doubter too, otherwise he wouldn't have sanctioned the deal.) Now I'm not so sure. He could have had a hat trick in the first half in the 3-0 win over Valencia and has come up big for Atleti on multiple occasions. I still don't like the price tag, but at the rate he's going I may change my mind over that too.\n\n5. Not all defeats are created equal, but three on the bounce still hurts: Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca called Saturday's 2-1 loss at Aston Villa \"the toughest of the season\" because his team showed a reaction after the Brighton humiliation and played well. I get what he's saying; I'd just view it differently. It's less concerning to me when you perform but are beaten than when you stink it up and are beaten. Chelsea's foolish decision to embark on the season without a credible alternative to Nico Jackson (who is now injured) is hurting them. With Noni Madueke also out, Maresca invented a setup with Reece James in midfield, Pedro Neto at center-forward and Cole Palmer wide on the right. They showed plenty of character and fight for much of the game and only lost the game thanks to Filip Jorgensen's howler. (Though, to be fair, it's hard to understand how Marc Cucurella got away with pulling down Lamare Bogarde in the box.) There are enough positives on which to build, and Southampton are next. As for Aston Villa, the Marcus Rashford/Marco Asensio narrative is compelling -- let's see if it lasts. Without question though, they're in the thick of the battle for a Champions League slot.\n\nplay 1:01 Are Spurs back after win vs. Ipswich? Don Hutchinson explains his issues with Tottenham despite their win against Ipswich.\n\n4. Spurs win at Ipswich, but it's still not clear who they are or what they're building toward: I don't mean tactically, because there we have enough of a sense of what Ange Postecoglou is trying to do. Some like it, some don't. There were headlines on Sunday about celebrating their third straight league victory away to Ipswich (4-1) thanks to the injured players returning. Technically, that's correct, but it's also misleading. The run began with a win at Brentford (in which they were battered for most of the game) and continued with humiliations away to Liverpool in the League Cup semifinal (0-4) and a comprehensive defeat at Aston Villa in the FA Cup (1-2). They then beat Manchester United (for what that's worth these days) before the Ipswich game, a match that could easily have taken a different turn. It's not a knock on Ange, it's just that when you still have key players out hurt (like your starting central defenders and your center forward, who is being replaced by a guy on loan with a totally different skill set) it's hard to assess where you are. Given Spurs have little to play for the rest of the campaign, that sense of drift will likely continue until everyone returns. Then Ange and Spurs can properly be assessed, one way or the other.\n\n3. Dusan Vlahovic starts and delivers for Juventus -- more of this, please: Yes, they probably overpaid for him and whoever thought it was a good idea to give him a contract with a balloon payment this season made a huge mistake. But it beggars belief that this was only his third start of 2025 when he's been fit throughout. He showed in Sunday's 1-0 win away to Cagliari (which saw Juventus move into the top 4) just what he can do when used properly, with the right players around him. OK, so Thiago Motta wanted to play with his shiny new Randal Kolo Muani toy, but Vlahovic is a real center forward. Fourteen goals in 25 starts this season tell their own story, especially on a team that has played as poorly as Juventus have. Who fits around him? I liked what he did with Kenan Yildiz and Kolo Muani, but sure, that raises the question of what to do with Chico Conceicao and Nico Gonzalez, who cost the club a lot of money last summer. That's for Motta to figure out.\n\nplay 2:09 Marcotti: Everton overturned penalty the 'worst use of VAR' Gab Marcotti slams the use of VAR during Everton vs. Manchester United which saw Ashley Young's late penalty overturned.\n\n2. Manchester United's horror show continues at Everton and could have been worse: Yup, it could -- arguably should -- have been their 13th league defeat of the season. That it wasn't is down to the VAR calling for an on-field review after referee Andy Madley awarded a penalty for Mathijs de Ligt's shirt-pull on Ashley Young. It wasn't a major tug and Young threw himself to the ground, but it was a stonewall penalty. Yet Madley overturned his original decision (possibly because it appeared he saw only one angle) and it finished 2-2 away to Everton. Add it to the laundry list of refereeing snafus we've seen in the Premier League this season and be grateful that in the grand scheme of things, it won't impact matters: neither team is going down. That said, the decision, while infuriating for Everton fans, shouldn't overshadow just how poor United were. Ruben Amorim said his team \"did not exist in the first half,\" a 45-minute spell in which they cobbled together two shots -- neither of them on target -- for an xG of 0.04. It wasn't much better in the second, as United's goals came via a Bruno Fernandes free kick and a Manuel Ugarte hit-and-hope. I've argued before that Man United should just focus on the FA Cup and Europa League since they won't achieve enough in the Premier League. If they keep playing like this, the Premier League is all they'll have left.\n\n1. When it rains, it pours for Milan after another self-inflicted defeat: After getting bounced out of the Champions League last week, Milan fell away to Torino 2-1 which means the screws are turning on manager S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o. However, you do have a bit of sympathy for the guy. Torino's opening goal came after Mike Maignan's clearance hit Malick Thiaw and ended up in the net. Christian Pulisic had his penalty saved by Vanja Milinkovic-Savic -- his fourth saved spot kick of the season, which is a lot. Milan dominated but couldn't score -- not until Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix finally came off and Tijjani Reijnders found the space for the equalizer. Then, after they fell asleep on a Torino free kick that was taken quickly, Gvidas Gineitis notched the winner. Conceicao complained that they were unlucky and it was \"not normal\" that they didn't win the game. Maybe so: luck, happenstance and randomness had a lot to do with this one. It doesn't change that it's unclear how he's helping. Rafael Le\u00e3o continues to regress, Felix continues to cramp Reijnders' style (and is showing no signs that he's been \"fixed\"), Youssouf Fofana is still on the bench and Theo Hern\u00e1ndez is still out there.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nAshley Young was initially awarded a penalty for a foul by Harry Maguire, but there was also a shirt-pull by Matthijs de Ligt. PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVideo Assistant Referee causes controversy every week in the Premier League. But how are decisions made and are they correct?\n\nAfter each weekend we take a look at the major incidents, to examine and explain the process both in terms of VAR protocol and the Laws of the Game.\n\nIn this week's VAR Review: Why Everton's overturned penalty against Manchester United is not as straightforward as you might think. Plus, a possible penalty for Aston Villa against Chelsea and red cards for Myles Lewis-Skelly and Illia Zabarnyi.\n\nPossible penalty overturn: Challenge by Maguire on Young\n\nWhat happened: Three minutes into stoppage time, a shot by Idrissa Gueye was saved by Andr\u00e9 Onana. As Ashley Young moved toward the rebound, he went down and appealed for a penalty. Referee Andy Madley pointed to the spot for a foul by Harry Maguire, which was checked by the VAR, Matt Donohue.\n\nVAR decision: Penalty canceled.\n\nVAR review: It was the big controversy of the weekend, with Manchester United rescued from almost certain defeat as the VAR stepped in to cancel a penalty to Everton.\n\nDid the referee really make a clear and obvious error, or did the VAR overstep?\n\nThe answer lies within the context of the on-field decision, and once you know the process it makes much more sense.\n\nIt has to be separated into two parts -- and that's what's not immediately apparent.\n\nThe on-field decision\n\nThe cornerstone of the VAR review was the original on-field decision. Madley gave a penalty for a foul by Maguire on Young, so that's what the VAR checks.\n\nMaguire placed a hand on Young's hip, but there was no hold or pull that would cause the Everton player to go to ground in the way he did.\n\nUpper body contact is viewed differently. For instance, a penalty may stand when a player goes down when through on goal even if the contact from the goalkeeper is slight. But when a pull is involved, the VAR will overturn if the attacker's actions are embellished -- as was the case in October when Chelsea had a penalty canceled against Newcastle United when the VAR ruled that Dan Burn had not pulled back Christopher Nkunku.\n\nIt was a clear and obvious error to give a penalty for this and the VAR was correct to overturn the penalty.\n\nIf the VAR doesn't think there was a foul by Maguire, he cannot unilaterally support the penalty for another reason, in this case the actions of Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nHarry Maguire placed only a hand on the hip of Ashley Young, as the referee was shown by the VAR. BBC\n\nDe Ligt's shirt-pulls\n\nDe Ligt grabbed Young's shirt twice, once at the side and then at the back. Had the referee given the penalty for the Netherlands international's actions there would have been no VAR review; to award the spot kick would not have been a clear and obvious error. But the referee incorrectly penalized Maguire, not De Ligt.\n\nYou must consider whether De Ligt's actions are worthy of a VAR review if the referee had given nothing.\n\nHolding is an offense when it impacts an opponent's ability to play or challenge for the ball, so a pull of the shirt by itself isn't a penalty. The VAR will take into account how long the shirt has been held, and if the player goes to ground in a way which is commensurate to the act.\n\nPenalties awarded through VAR this season have all been for extreme examples of holding -- save for the red card shown to Southampton's Ryan Fraser for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO).\n\nDonohue decided that the holding was \"fleeting\" (we've heard this before) and Young threw himself to ground in an exaggerated way. Therefore, this didn't meet the threshold for a clear and obvious error for a penalty. It would be difficult to support as a standalone review, based upon past similar incidents.\n\nThe goal-mouth camera gave a clearer view of a possible shirt-pull. BBC\n\nWhy wasn't the referee shown the correct angles?\n\nAgain, it's down to the original decision, and the reason the referee was sent to the screen.\n\nThe VAR showed the referee several angles involving Maguire because the review was to cancel the penalty for that offense. Madley agreed to rescind the spot kick after being shown these.\n\nThis wasn't about concentrating on the wrong angles, it was the opposite: showing the referee the angles related to his on-field decision.\n\nThe referee was shown the possible shirt-pull using the high-behind camera. BBC\n\nHowever, the De Ligt incident wasn't ignored at the monitor. After accepting the Maguire review, Madley was shown the shirt-pulls by De Ligt from the \"high behind\" camera, offering the referee the chance to assess it without advising there was enough in it for a spot kick.\n\nPerhaps the referee could have been shown the goal-mouth camera angle, but remember the VAR has decided that there is no clear and obvious error related to De Ligt. The referee could also have requested further angles after seeing the high-behind.\n\nplay 1:50 Hislop: Right call to overturn Everton's late penalty vs. Man United Shaka Hislop backs the referee's decision to overturn his own call to award Everton a late penalty in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United.\n\nVerdict: Earlier this month, Tony Scholes, the Premier League's chief football officer, said he wants to get to a place where \"full visibility and full audio of the conversation between the referee and the VAR\" is played out live. It's vital that that happens. But after eight years with VAR, the IFAB appears no closer to allowing even trials.\n\nIn this case, hearing the interaction would have made a huge difference to the general understanding, even if you still didn't agree with the final outcome.\n\nThere was a clear and obvious error to give a penalty against Maguire, so this wasn't re-refereeing the game. But to those watching without the context of the review, it may look to be the VAR getting involved when the decision should stay on the field.\n\nWe saw a similar kind of review last season, which was also confusing because no one could be aware of what went on at the monitor. The VAR told the referee that Brighton & Hove Albion's Lewis Dunk had been pulled back by Brentford's Yoane Wissa and it should be a penalty, but prior to that Wissa had himself been fouled by Dunk. The referee was sent to the screen and shown the penalty infringement, and also the initial foul. Rather than a penalty, play restarted with a free kick to Brentford.\n\nPossible offside: Build up to Beto goal\n\nWhat happened: Everton took the lead in the 19th minute when Beto scored from close range, but there was an offside check which took 3 minutes and 20 seconds. What was the VAR looking at?\n\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\n\nVAR review: This took far too long, partly because there was doubt about whether Jesper Lindstrom had touched the ball to set the offside phase to Beto, though he wouldn't have been offside anyway.\n\nThere was also two close offside situations as the ball pinged around the box, but it's doubtful the players involved were having any impact on the move.\n\nBeto was onside but the check took far too long. BBC\n\nVerdict: The Premier League's new semiautomated VAR offside technology (SAOT) will be used for the first time in the FA Cup fifth round, but it wouldn't make a difference in a situation like this.\n\nAs there's no chip in the ball, there would still be a question of Lindstrom touching the ball, and the VAR would have to weigh the possible impact if other players were offside. SAOT would have no impact on these aspects.\n\nPossible penalty: Challenge by Cucurella on Bogarde\n\nWhat happened: Aston Villa won a free kick in the 83rd minute, which was swung into the area by Marcus Rashford. In dropped to the edge of the 6-yard box and as Lamare Bogarde tried to react he went to ground under a challenge from Marc Cucurella. Referee Michael Oliver allowed play to continue, and it was checked by the VAR, Paul Tierney.\n\nVAR decision: No penalty.\n\nLamare Bogarde was being pulled back by Marc Cucurella. BBC\n\nVAR review: One of the considerations for a possible offense is both players being involved in mutual holding. If that's present, there's no foul by either player and they are equally culpable.\n\nBoth Cucurella and Bogarde have a hold of each other's arms, and this is why the VAR chose not to intervene.\n\nVerdict: This was a quick VAR check, and it could be that the VAR saw the players had their arms entwined so judged it didn't need further attention.\n\nBut what is not immediately apparent is that Cucurella was holding the Aston Villa player with both of his arms and prevents him from getting to the ball. Oliver may have been unsighted to this, but the VAR should have picked it up.\n\nUnlike the \"fleeting\" shirt-tugs by De Ligt on Young, this is the kind of holding offence which should be the subject of a VAR review.\n\nPossible red card: DOGSO by Lewis-Skelly\n\nWhat happened: Mohammed Kudus robbed Myles Lewis-Skelly in the 73rd minute, and the West Ham United forward advanced past the halfway line with Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya well out of his goal. Lewis-Skelly fouled Kudus, with referee Craig Pawson showing a yellow card. It was checked for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO) by the VAR, Peter Bankes.\n\nVAR decision: Red card.\n\nVAR review: Although Kudus was on the halfway line when he was brought down by Lewis-Skelly he had control of the ball and Raya was in no man's land; the West Ham United player would have had the chance to shoot at goal.\n\nIf Raya had been inside his area, there might have been some doubt because Kudus was in a wider area and he would have needed to get closer to goal to have a realistic chance of scoring.\n\nMohammed Kudus was pulled down by Myles Lewis-Skelly with David Raya well out of his goal. BBC\n\nThe only other VAR red card for DOGSO this season was for another Arsenal player, when William Saliba saw red at AFC Bournemouth, and there are some similarities with the fouls happening a long way from goal. In Saliba's case, Raya was much deeper but backtracking into his area, and the play was in a central area with the ball positioned for Evanilson to run on to.\n\nThere were claims of a foul by Kudus on Lewis-Skelly as he won possession, but there wasn't enough in that to be seen as a clear and obvious error.\n\nVerdict: A textbook DOGSO red card which really should have been identified by the referee at the time. But then isn't this what VAR should be fixing?\n\nPossible red card: Serious foul play by Zabarnyi\n\nWhat happened: Illia Zabarnyi stretched into a challenge on Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri in the 29th minute, and he caught the Wolverhampton Wanderers player high above the ankle. Referee Michael Salisbury produced a yellow card, and it was checked for serious foul play by the VAR, Stuart Attwell.\n\nVAR decision: Red card.\n\nVAR review: Red cards when a player's foot has come off the top of the ball always appear controversial, the most high profile being Curtis Jones' red card for Liverpool at Tottenham Hotspur last season.\n\nThe perception is that if the ball has been played, a player shouldn't be penalized for accidental contact which may follow. But it's always how the player is making the challenge which determines serious foul play.\n\nZabarnyi was perhaps unfortunate, but he made contact high on the shin of A\u00eft-Nouri because he went over the top of the ball -- not because he went through it. Ergo, the challenge was already high and wasn't solely determined by the foot coming off the ball.\n\nVerdict: The challenge was at full stretch and he caught A\u00eft-Nouri high on the shin, causing the player's ankle to buckle. This won't be recorded as an incorrect VAR intervention.\n\nIllia Zabarnyi was shown a VAR red card for a high challenge on Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri. BBC\n\nPossible offside: Szoboszlai and Jones on second goal\n\nWhat happened: Liverpool scored a second goal in the 37th minute when Dominik Szoboszlai fired home from just inside the area. The VAR had to check two possible offside offenses within the move.\n\nVAR decision: Goal stands.\n\nVAR review: Szoboszlai was in an offside position from the initial ball over the top, but crucially the Hungary international had no interest in getting involved in the play and allowed an onside Mohamed Salah to run onto the ball.\n\nThere was a bigger question about the role of Curtis Jones, who was clearly offside when Szoboszlai took the shot.\n\nImportantly, Jones wasn't in Ederson's line of vision to the ball, and Szoboszlai's shot went to the opposite side of where he was stood.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai didn't make a move to play the ball or impact an opponent when in an offside position. BBC\n\nVerdict: Had the ball passed close to Jones, the midfielder could have been judged to be impacting the goalkeeper. That would also have been the case if Jones was closer to Ederson.\n\nBut this is much like Manchester City's winning goal at Wolves earlier this season, when Bernardo Silva was not in the line of goalkeeper's vision. John Stones' goal was ruled out on the field but was awarded following a VAR review.\n\nCurtis Jones was not in Ederson's line of vision or close enough to have an impact. BBC\n\nPossible penalty: Handball by Aina\n\nWhat happened: Lewis Hall tried to put a cross into the box in the 28th minute, which was blocked by Ola Aina. Newcastle United players appealed for a penalty, but referee Jarred Gillett allowed play to continue. It was checked by the VAR, Peter Bankes.\n\nVAR decision: Penalty, scored by Alexander Isak.\n\nHandball penalties this season Games Pens Frequency Premier League 261 6 43.50 Champions League 160 11 14.55 LaLiga 249 18 13.83 Bundesliga 207 16 12.94 Serie A 258 25 10.32 Ligue 1 198 28 7.07 Frequency is games per penalty\n\nVAR review: It's only the sixth penalty awarded for handball in the Premier League all season -- far less than any other top European league or competition.\n\nEach time it has been given, a player has either had his arm raised high, or fully extended away from the body.\n\nVerdict: Aina is perhaps the most unfortunate to penalized, as he was jumping and the arm wasn't above shoulder height, but it still created an obvious barrier.\n\nForest later had penalty appeals of their own, including one against Lewis Miley but the Newcastle player had his arm tucked into his body.\n\nOla Aina's arm was raised and blocked the cross from Lewis Hall. BBC\n\nPossible penalty: Challenge by O'Shea on Danso\n\nWhat happened: The game was in the 64th minute when Lucas Bergvall played a pass for Kevin Danso in the area. Dara O'Shea came across and shoulder barged the Tottenham Hotspur player off the ball, but referee Tim Robinson gave a goal kick as the ball ran out of play. It was checked by the VAR, Chris Kavanagh.\n\nVAR decision: No penalty.\n\nKevin Danso was knocked over inside the area by Dara O'Shea. BBC\n\nVAR review: Can it be argued that O'Shea is trying to protect the ball to win the goal kick? He took a huge risk doing so in such a fashion.\n\nIt's a strong challenge and had the referee awarded a penalty it wouldn't have been overturned, but at the same time we haven't seen VAR penalties awarded for situations like this.\n\nVerdict: There was a similar case two weeks ago when Beto claimed he had been fouled by Leicester City's Jannik Vestergaard, who came across with a strong challenge to push the Everton striker off the ball. The KMI panel voted that it should have been given a penalty on the field (4-1) but on a split 3-2 vote said it didn't reach the threshold for a VAR intervention.\n\nSome factual parts of this article include information provided by the Premier League and PGMOL.",

(1:07)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has urged supporters to make Anfield \"horrible\" for opponents in the coming months as his team seek to get their Premier League title challenge over the line.\n\nGoals from Mohamed Salah and Dominik Szoboszlai helped Liverpool beat reigning champions Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad on Sunday, moving Arne Slot's side 11 points clear at the top of the table.\n\nWhile second-place Arsenal have a game in hand, Liverpool are now the overwhelming favourites to get their hands on the trophy this season and have the added advantage of seven of their last 11 league games being at home.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Liverpool's win in Manchester, Van Dijk said: \"I mentioned it after that [Wolves] game, that obviously it's pretty normal to be [nervous] like that,\" he said. \"It is a human [reaction] that there could be some anxious feelings kicking in, and that could still be the case.\n\nVirgil van Dijk has been in imperious form for Liverpool as they have established themselves as title favourites. Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images\n\n\"But I think it only helps us and them [the supporters] as well to make Anfield horrible for the opponent. Most of the time we have been doing that, and obviously the way we play helps with that as well.\n\n\"How many home games are left? Seven out of 11. So let's make sure those seven are going to be amazing, as loud as possible. I don't think we have to speak about it because normally that is the case.\n\n\"So let's go, enjoy, focus on Wednesday now, and then we'll see what happens after.\"\n\nLiverpool's win against City marked the club's first Premier League victory at the Etihad in a decade. It was the fourth game in a testing run of five matches in 15 days for the league leaders, who host Newcastle United at Anfield on Wednesday night.\n\n\"This was a big win,\" Van Dijk said. \"I told the guys, 'Don't take these wins for granted, but when you go home, recover and be ready for the preparation for Newcastle.'\n\n\"That's the only thing we have to do. Tunnel vision. Nothing else matters really. And we need our fans to be in great shape on Wednesday as well.\"\n\nVan Dijk has played every minute of Liverpool's Premier League season so far, playing alongside Ibrahima Konat\u00e9, Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah, all of whom have dealt with injury issues.\n\nHis contract situation with the Merseyside club remains unresolved, however, with his existing deal due to expire at the end of the season.",

After the match, Mourinho made a point of praising the referee, highlighting the fact he was not from Turkey.\n\n\"The performance of the referee was a top performance,\" Mourinho told his postmatch news conference.\n\n\"Anyone, not just from this country but also abroad, watched a big football match. I think the man responsible for that was the referee.\n\nGalatasaray said they will report Jose Mourinho for his postmatch comments. Arife Karakum/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n\"I went to the referee's dressing room after the game. Of course, the fourth official was there, a Turkish referee. And I told him [the referee], thank you [for coming] here.\n\n\"I turn myself to the fourth official and I told [him] this match, if you are the referee ... would be a disaster. When I say him, I say the general tendency.\"\n\nMourinho was also asked about an incident early in the game involving his 19-year-old defender Yusuf Akcicek, to which he said: \"Again, I have to thank the referee because with a Turkish referee after the big dive and the first minute and their bench jumping like monkeys on top of the kids.\n\n\"A Turkish referee would have [given Akcicek] a yellow card after one minute, and after five minutes I would have to change him.\"\n\nGalatasaray responded with a statement: \"Since the commencement of his managerial duties in T\u00fcrkiye, Fenerbah\u00e7e manager Jose Mourinho has persistently issued derogatory statements directed towards the Turkish people.\n\n\"Today, his discourse has escalated beyond merely immoral comments into unequivocally inhumane rhetoric.\n\n\"We hereby formally declare our intention to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the racist statements made by Jose Mourinho, and shall accordingly submit official complaints to UEFA and FIFA.\n\n\"Furthermore, we shall diligently observe the stance adopted by Fenerbah\u00e7e -- an institution professing to uphold 'exemplary moral values' -- in response to the reprehensible conduct exhibited by their manager.\"\n\nMourinho has been critical of the officiating in Turkey this season. In January, he said there was a \"toxic\" environment around referees in the S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nIn November, the former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur manager was banned for a game and fined following his diatribe about Turkish soccer, when he said he was fighting \"the system\" and suggested officials are biased against his team.\n\nHe has led Fenerbahce to a Europa League round-of-16 contest against Rangers next month.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.",

(1:40)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nManchester United have announced plans to make up to another 200 staff redundant as part of their continuing cost-cutting measures.\n\nUnited announced their first wave of job losses last season with around 250 employees leaving in the summer. The latest cuts -- unveiled just days after the one-year anniversary of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival as co-owner -- will be in addition to those redundancies and will affect between 150 and 200 club staff.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to put Manchester United in the strongest position to win across our men's, women's and academy teams,\" CEO Omar Berrada said in a statement released on Monday. \"We are initiating a wide-ranging series of measures which will transform and renew the club.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe has set about creating a more streamlined workforce at Man United since investing in the club. Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images\n\n\"Unfortunately, this means announcing further potential redundancies and we deeply regret the impact on those affected colleagues. However, these hard choices are necessary to put the club back on a stable financial footing.\"\n\nSources told ESPN that staff will find out if they are affected by the cuts between April and June.\n\nUnited have announced losses of more than \u00a3300 million ($379m) over the last three years.\n\nLast week, the club issued their latest financial results which showed revenues have dropped to \u00a3198.7m for the final three months of 2024, down from \u00a3225.8m for the same period a year earlier.\n\n\"We have lost money for the past five consecutive years,\" Berrada added.\n\n\"This cannot continue. Our two main priorities as a club are delivering success on the pitch for our fans and improving our facilities. We cannot invest in these objectives if we are continuously losing money.\"\n\nIn addition to further redundancies, United are planning to move some staff from offices at Old Trafford to their Carrington training ground. There will also be a \"reduced presence\" at their London office in Mayfair.\n\nIn a staff meeting on Monday, staff were also informed that free lunches at Old Trafford will come to an end. A source has told ESPN that bosses expect the move to save the club more than \u00a31m every year.\n\nSources added to ESPN that the club will focus its charitable donations on the Manchester United Foundation (MUF) and Manchester United Disabled Supporters' Association, with conversations ongoing with the MUF over the value of the contributions.",

For sure, we need big players, top players like Cole but we are not worried about Cole at all.\"\n\nCole Palmer is undergoing a dip in form following a blistering start to the season. Getty\n\nPalmer appeared to vent his frustration on several occasions at Villa Park, following on from similar incidents in successive defeats to Brighton but Maresca denied there was any underlying unhappiness.\n\n\"At the end, also there are team mates that can be frustrated with the chances we miss against Villa and against City. I think both chances were Cole, no? Very clear,\" he said.\n\n\"The other day we were 1-1, to score [to go] 1-2 [up], ten minutes to go. Against City, it was 0-1 could be 0-2 after 10 minutes and I didn't see his team mates frustrated so Cole is just upset just because we are not winning games, no more than that.\"\n\nAsked how the 22-year-old -- who had enjoyed a prolific campaign until his recent slump -- could get back to the form which saw him amass 14 goals and six assists from 26 league games, Maresca replied: \"Just continue working in the way he is working. The other day I think, yes, he had a great chance but overall the performance from Cole ... as I said every game we expect from him a goal or assist so it is difficult.\n\n\"He is a human being. In this moment probably his performance also reflects a little bit the team performance -- that we struggle to score goals -- and we need to be a little more clinical in chances.\"\n\nMaresca also confirmed Filip J\u00f8rgensen will continue in goal after his last-minute error gifted Villa their win.\n\nJorgensen had replaced Robert S\u00e1nchez following a string of mistakes but Maresca said: \"\"If we need to change players every time there is a mistake, we need to change players game by game, many players. But no, nothing has changed.\"\n\nMeanwhile,Trevoh Chalobah is sidelined for around 10 days with a back problem.",

Guardiola left the experience of R\u00faben Dias, Mateo Kovacic, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Bernardo Silva on the bench in favour of a team with an average age of just 24.7-years-old.\n\nCity included three 20-year-olds -- Rico Lewis, Savinho and Abdukodir Khusanov -- in the starting XI and, despite the result, Guardiola said he was impressed.\n\n\"I saw a bright future,\" Guardiola told the BBC.\n\n\"Other than Kevin [De Bruyne] and Nathan [Ake], they are the future of this club in the next years, with others who will come in future windows.\n\n\"It was a good game. Tight game in the first half. First half it was more open and in the second half they defended very deep. They always have the threat but it is not easy to control it. Big compliment to them but I am very pleased with the way we play.\"\n\nPep Guardiola saw the positive side of Manchester City's defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nThe result leaves City 20 points behind Liverpool in the table and Guardiola's team have plenty of work to do in order to close the gap and challenge for the title next season.\n\nAsked what the biggest difference between the two side is right now, Guardiola told ESPN: 'You can see it in the table, they've picked up a lot of points, we've lost a lot when we couldn't have.\n\n\"As for today, I have few things to say, we got to the touchline a lot, the winger was brilliant, but we lacked the quality to be able to resolve [the moves].\"\n\nCity were without Erling Haaland again because the knee injury picked up during the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nThe striker was kept on the bench against Real Madrid in midweek and was left out of the squad entirely against Liverpool.\n\nCity face Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and Guardiola is unsure whether the Norway international will be back.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I am not saying we didn't get the result because Erling was not there. That is unfair on the other players. We could finish more but in general it is fine.\"\n\nInformation from ESPN's Joao Castelo-Branco contributed to this report",

I'm happy.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old Parry had led after the first two rounds but had to settle for the runner-up prize after an errant tee shot on the 14th saw him bogey the hole and let Kruyswijk get away. Parry finished with a 68 for a four-round total of 268.\n\nDeon Germishuys was third, three shots further back at 13-under with his South African compatriot Jayden Schaper fourth at 12-under.",

Sei Young Kim holds the record by shooting 31-under in 2018 at Thornberry Creek. Shanshan Feng went 29-under the following year at Thornberry Creek.\n\nSunday's victory is the California native's second LPGA title after winning the Buick LPGA Shanghai in 2023. Yin is a two-time major runner-up: at the 2023 Chevron Championship and the 2019 U.S. Women's Open.\n\nYin's best finish in four previous appearances at LPGA Thailand was a share of third place in 2021.\n\n\"I wasn't that comfortable because Akie shot 10-under the first day and this course is very gettable,\" Yin said. \"So I just had to keep my head down.\"\n\nIwai was in stunning form as her 10 birdies got the 22-year-old sponsor invite within one shot of Yin with two holes to play, but a lone bogey at the par-4 17th ended her challenge.\n\nThai players completed the top five with Jeeno Thitikul, runner-up in 2021, posting a 67 to finish in third at 21-under 267. Patty Tavatanakit (65) and Moriya Jutanugarn (68) were in a tie for fourth at 19-under 269.\n\nThe event is the first stop of the LPGA's Asian swing.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nVALLARTA, Mexico -- Aldrich Potgieter had the lead going into the final round of the Mexico Open, minus the cushion he enjoyed after a sloppy finish Saturday that made him settle for a 4-under 67 and a one-shot advantage over Brian Campbell at Vidanta Vallarta.\n\nPotgieter, the 20-year-old power player from South Africa, started with a four-shot lead and held off one challenge early from Stephan Jaeger, who closed within one shot after six holes.\n\nThe next challenge came from Campbell, who at times was 50 yards shorter off the tee than Potgieter but made up for it with his putter, including a 60-foot birdie on the par-3 ninth.\n\nPotgieter was leading by three shots with two holes left in the third round when he badly missed his tee shot to the right on the par-3 17th, the ball settling in some bushes. He managed to punch that out into the grass, then hit a beautiful pitch to save bogey.\n\nOn the par-5 18th, Potgieter came up well short with a 7-iron for his second shot after another big drive. From a waste area, he went just over the back of the green, chipped to a front pin and had to make a 5-footer for par.\n\nCampbell finished with a birdie for a 64 to get within one shot as both go for their first PGA Tour title and a trip to the Masters.\n\nJaeger went from within one shot to falling five shots behind, only to rally with a pair of birdies on the par 5s for a 66 to finish three behind.\n\nPotgieter was at 20-under 193.\n\nHe would love nothing more than a return to Augusta National, where he played in 2023 as the British Amateur champion. Potgieter earned his PGA Tour card through the Korn Ferry Tour, which featured one win early and a 59 in Colombia.\n\nThat firepower, particularly his length, is what has kept him in front at Vidanta Vallarta, a course with five par 5s and plenty of room off the tee. He has led the field in driving distance all three days, checking in 329.4 yards for his average Saturday.\n\nHe played in the last group with Campbell and Jaeger -- the same trio for the final round -- and Campbell wasn't the least bit bothered by the difference in length. He plotted his way to a bogey-free round that gives him a shot at his first PGA Tour win.\n\nJaeger, who held off Scottie Scheffler to win the Houston Open last year, drove into the water on the reachable par-4 seventh hole after getting within one shot of Potgieter. He made bogey, a two-shot swing when the South African made birdie, and Jaeger did well to finish within three shots at the end of the round.\n\nAlex Smalley had a 64 and was five shots behind, with Aaron Rai (68) and Ben Griffin (67) another shot back.\n\nJustin Hastings of the Cayman Islands, the San Diego State senior who won the Latin American Amateur last month to earn a trip to the Masters, had a 65 and was tied for ninth with Patrick Rodgers and Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard, who twice chipped in for eagle on the back nine.\n\n\"Now that I made the cut, which I think was a big goal this week, it took a lot of stress off and I felt like I played a lot more free today,\" Hastings said. \"Yeah, I think it showed on the scorecard. It was a lot less stressful.\"\n\nThe stakes Sunday are more than just a trip to the Masters. The winner will gets in The Players Championship and the PGA Championship, along with five of the remaining $20 million signature events. Jaeger is already in from his top-50 finish in the FedEx Cup last year.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nIt has been another bad week for Manchester City. But after being knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid and symbolically dethroned as Premier League champions in a 2-0 home defeat to runaway leaders Liverpool, it could get even worse from here for Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nLeaving aside the shadow of the hearing into the Premier League's 115 charges for breaching financial regulations -- a verdict is expected within the next month or so -- the weeks ahead look bleak for a team that last season became the first in English history to win four successive league titles.\n\nCity have lost 14 of their past 27 games in all competitions and eight of their past 17 in the Premier League. Their woeful form, which is unprecedented since Guardiola's arrival as coach in 2016, has now left the club facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League.\n\nWednesday's Premier League trip to Tottenham Hotspur has become meaningless in terms of City's title hopes. With Liverpool 20 points ahead at the top of the table, City are out of the running to claim a fifth straight championship. But it is crucial nonetheless in the context of saving City's season.\n\nEven though the Premier League is almost certain to have five Champions League qualification spots for next season (with England in a dominant position at the top of UEFA's coefficient table) the safety net of the extra place will only offer the faintest of comfort to City in contrast to their worrying form. Sitting in fourth position in the Premier League heading into the midweek fixtures, City are only a point clear of sixth-place AFC Bournemouth and just four ahead of ninth-place Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nOver the past 10 Premier League games, City sit in sixth position in the form guide, with Bournemouth and Newcastle -- sixth and fifth respectively in the table -- ahead of them. In the past 15 games, City are ninth behind Chelsea, Aston Villa, Bournemouth and Newcastle United, so the threat to Guardiola's hopes of extending City's run of Champions League qualifications to a 14th straight season is clear.\n\nCity are beset by injuries -- Ballon d'Or winner Rodri might not play again this season, John Stones and Manuel Akanji are facing weeks on the sidelines and Erling Haaland's knee injury is causing concern -- and serial winners Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Bernardo Silva are fading fast as players capable of making an impact.\n\nPep Guardiola's worst year as a manager could plumb new depths if Manchester City miss out on next season's Champions League. James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nSo could City's season actually get worse to the extent that they miss out on qualifying for the Champions League? The reality is that they are now one of six clubs scrambling for two places, and recent performances offer little encouragement that Guardiola's squad have nothing to worry about.\n\nThe good news for City is that none of the teams below them are tearing it up. Newcastle have lost three of their past six Premier League games, including a 4-0 loss at City on Feb. 15, while Bournemouth's impressive run of four wins in five league games was surprisingly halted with a 1-0 home defeat to relegation-threatened Wolverhampton Wanderers over the weekend.\n\nChelsea have dropped to seventh following a nightmare run of two wins and five defeats in their past 10 league games, and Villa only ended a five-game Premier League winless streak with a 2-1 victory against Chelsea at Villa Park on Saturday. Brighton have the best form of the Champions League chasers, winning four of their past six league games, but their two defeats in that run were a shocking 1-0 loss at home to a then-struggling Everton and a 7-0 hammering at Forest. So of the six teams chasing the final two Champions League qualification spots, none can boast of being in unbeatable form, but the inconsistency is giving them all hope of a top-five finish.\n\nCity, at least, have the benefit of being in control of their own destiny because they occupy a Champions League spot. It's a simple equation for Guardiola and his players: Win more games than the teams below you, and it will be possible to salvage the bare minimum from this season. But that means beating a resurgent Spurs on Wednesday and then denting Brighton's hopes with another victory at the Etihad on March 15. City also have home games against Villa and Bournemouth in the weeks ahead.\n\nBy this stage of a typical City season under Guardiola, all of those games would be regarded as nothing short of formalities, with City surging to a series of wins on the way to another title.\n\nBut this isn't a typical season, and City have been dragged down into the ranks of also-rans, so nothing can be guaranteed -- not even a place in the Champions League.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nNovember, 1952. Seventy-two years and four months ago.\n\nThat was the last time Como 1907 had defeated Napoli in Serie A - until last Sunday. In between, there was a constant flirtation with all four tiers of Italian football, including the club's best-ever spell of five consecutive years in the top-flight during the mid-80s. The club also survived two bankruptcies (in 2004 and 2016), necessitating a restart in Serie D and working their way up.\n\nIt's not exactly a Cinderella story; the club is technically the richest club in Italian football, being owned by Indonesian tobacco conglomerate Djarum. When you consider the surroundings - Lake Como being the playground of the rich and famous - it's not exactly the most romantic of stories of a plucky underdog club from a disadvantaged area making it big.\n\nAnd yet, there was much rejoicing when newly promoted Como stunned Napoli in Serie A on Sunday with a 2-1 win. A lot had to do with the actual people involved.\n\nCesc Fabregas joined Como in Serie B as a player in 2022, and you could hear the quiet laughter. Along with Thierry Henry, the Spaniard became a minority stakeholder in the club, and given the surroundings, there was a dismissal of Fabregas' intentions. While Fabregas hung up his playing boots soon after, the club proved far from a retirement home - a spell as player-manager turned into caretaker manager, then assistant last year as he earned his UEFA Pro Licence and Como worked their way up to Serie A.\n\nThis year was his first full season as manager, and Fabregas had already picked up some impressive victories - 3-2 away to Atalanta, a 2-0 win at home to Roma, and even a 2-0 win away to Fiorentina coming into the game against Napoli. The script writers stood ready with their 'apprentice beats master' headlines as Antonio Conte, who delivered Fabregas a Premier League title and FA Cup as a player with Chelsea, stood in the opposition dugout.\n\nAnd Fabregas obliged.\n\nComo 1907 coach Cesc Fabregas issues instructions to his players during the match against Napoli Marco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nThe game began with horror shows for either defence as Amir Rrahmani and Marc-Oliver Kepmf gifted goals to their opponents, but it evolved into Como taking the upper hand in the second half. The unfancied youngsters of Como were going toe-to-toe with their title-challenging opposition and reduced Conte's side to counterattacks.\n\nFabregas outlined why after the game, saying \"We want to play in a certain way with a lot of personality and courage. There is no one best way to play, but we have this mentality. We still have to improve many things. I told the players not to give up and believe.\"\n\nTwo of those players who chose not to give up and believe were unsurprisingly, the youngsters guiding Como's push up the table to 13th place - Nico Paz and Assane Diao. The latter was a January buy from Spain, with Fabregas personally involved in bringing the 19-year-old from Real Betis in a \u20ac12m outlay. The Senegal-born winger proved an immediate hit, with goals against Milan, Juventus, Udinese and Fiorentina coming into this game.\n\nPaz, a product of Real Madrid's academy (and so highly rated that the La Liga giants have a buyback clause), has been Como's saving grace throughout this season, with 11 goal involvements. The 20-year-old Argentinian is flourishing under his manager, telling broadcasters after the game \"I want to improve and grow. Fabregas has a vision of football very close to mine and most of all he helps me give the best for the team\".\n\nNico Paz, Assane Diao and Maxence Caqueret of Como 1907 celebrate a goal Marco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nOne could almost see the Fabregas-esque vision when Paz picked up the ball in the centre of the park in the 77th minute of the game. Diao had made a clever run behind the defence, bisecting the gap between Giovanni di Lorenzo and Rrahmani, but Paz chose to drive forward anyway. It wasn't the right time - a touch to draw Rrahmani towards him (and thus give Diao more time) and he fired a pass to his forward's legs. Like Fabregas' passes, Paz sent a message along with his pass, and Diao obliged.\n\nThe teenager rolled the ball off his heels and shifted it in front of him with a strong touch, thus preventing Rrahmani and Alessandro Buongiorno being able to slide in and prevent him from striking. That touch had also afforded Diao the space to stretch out his leg and strike the ball. It's exactly situations such as these where a youngster facing the excitement and prospect of winning the game would snatch at the ball, hurrying his shot. But Diao is no ordinary youngster - the strike was smoothly timed like a golf swing, his boot sending the ball low and hard into the bottom corner. Alex Meret in the Napoli goal had no chance, and as the ball nestled in the net, the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia erupted in a huge roar.\n\nPaz x Diao \ufffd\ufffd Como's young stars linked up for the winner \ufffd\ufffd#ComoNapoli pic.twitter.com/XkIjFlASlQ - Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) February 24, 2025\n\nOff Fabregas went, running and pumping his fists down the touchline, not for as long as a certain other manager of his, but having proved a point, nonetheless. Diao's goal had blown the Serie A title race wide open, with Napoli tasting second place for the first time in a while, and also confirmed why many clubs will chase his signature in the future.\n\nFor their teenaged brilliance with Diao, the burgeoning reputation of Fabregas the manager, and sending Napoli's title dreams into the neighbouring lake, Como take our Moment of the Weekend.",

The La Liga, race is poised on a knife's edge with three teams - Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - in touching distance and three winning this weekend.\n\nOver at Serie A, a point separates the top two as Napoli were beaten by Como to go second to Inter, while Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain are doing the usual things - topping comfortably - in their respective leagues.\n\nESPN's By The Numbers brings you the best of stats from weekend's football matches:\n\n49\n\nMohamed Salah has both scored and assisted a goal in 49 separate league matches in his career in Europe's big-five leagues. This puts him in elite company; only Lionel Messi (102) and Cristiano Ronaldo (65) have more done this more times since Opta have this data available (from 2006-07).\n\n50\n\nSalah is the first player in Europe's top five leagues to be directly involved in 50 goals in all competitions this season (30 goals, 20 assists).\n\n11\n\nSalah has scored and assisted in 11 different PL games this season; the most in PL history and most in a season by a player in one of Europe's top five leagues since Lionel Messi in 2014-15 (11 for Barcelona).\n\n16, 11\n\nSalah is now tied for most away goals (16) and most away assists (11) in a Premier League season.

This was the club's longest since Dec. 2010 - April 2011 (16).\n\n19 years\n\nWest Ham defeats Arsenal in back-to-back Premier League road games for the first time since 2006-07. Back then, West Ham became the last team to beat Arsenal at Highbury and the first to beat the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium.\n\n1\n\nChelsea suffered back-to-back losses after scoring the first goal for the first time in Premier League since April 2004, under Claudio Ranieri.\n\n1\n\nManuel Ugarte scored his first career goal for Manchester United in all competitions (30 matches) and his first club goal since Oct 26, 202, back when he was with Sporting.\n\n10, 11\n\nBruno Fernandes is the only Manchester United player with double digits in both goals (10) and assists (11) this season in all competitions.\n\n2\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly got his second career direct red card, both this season (Jan. 25 vs Wolverhampton). He is the 1st Arsenal player with multiple straight red cards in a PL season since David Luiz in 2019/20.\n\n2\n\nAlexander Isak is the second player after Alan Shearer to reach 50 PL goals for Newcastle.\n\n1\n\nThe top 3 teams are separated by only one point. This is the fewest the La Liga Top 3 has been separated by at this stage of a season since 1995-96 (in 3-point per win era).\n\n29.4 yards\n\nLuka Modric scored his longest career La Liga goal with a distance of 29.4 yards.\n\n39 years and 167days\n\nLuka Modric - at 39 years and 167 day - also broke his own club record as oldest Real Madrid scorer and passed Larbi Benbarek (39y 124d) for 6th oldest goalscorer in La Liga.\n\n102\n\nVin\u00edcius Jr. now has 102 career goals for Real Madrid, 2 behind Ronaldo N\u00e1zario (104), which is the record for most by a Brazilian for the club.\n\n11\n\nReal Madrid have scored 11 goals from outside the penalty area this season. This is the most in La Liga and tied with Bayern Munich for most in Europe's top 5 leagues.\n\n16\n\nLamine Yamal ties Kylian Mbappe and Jadon Sancho for most assists by a player before turning 18 year old in the last 15 seasons of the Top 5 European leagues.\n\n6\n\nWojciech Szczesny has 6 shutouts in 10 matches with Barcelona in all competitions. So far, Barcelona are unbeaten when he starts (7-1-0, W-L-D) in all competitions.\n\n84\n\nAtletico have an ongoing 84-game active unbeaten run when leading at any point in the match. This is the longest active streak by any club from the top 5 European leagues.\n\n7\n\nAthletic Club scored 7 goals in a La Liga game for the first time since April 1994 vs Sporting Gijon (7-0). This is also the club's largest win since Oct. 1996 vs Logrones (6-0).\n\n5+\n\nAtalanta have scored 5+ goals in Serie A for the fourth time this season tying Olympique Marseille for the 3rd-most among teams from Europe's Top 5 Leagues. Only Bayern Munich and Barcelona has more games with 5+ goals (5 both).\n\n1\n\nChristian Pulisic failed to convert a penalty for the first time in his career. He had a perfect 12-for-12 for club and country before this.\n\n10\n\nWith the assist vs Napoli, Nico Paz reaches 10 goal contributions (6 goals, 4 assists) this season in Serie A. He is the only player with 10 G+A in Como this season in league play.\n\n69\n\nBayern Munich have scored 69 goals in Bundesliga this season, the most among teams from Europe's Top 5 Leagues this season.\n\n28\n\nXabi Alonso has gone undefeated in 28 straight Bundesliga road games, breaking the league's record by a manager held by Udo Lattek (27 away games from 1985 to 1992).\n\n11\n\nJamal Musiala has 11 goals this season in Bundesliga, 1 shy of tying his career-best tally in Bundesliga set in 2022/23 (12 goals in 33 games)\n\n0\n\nAfter PSG's win over Lyon, it remains as the only team that has not lost a league match this season among teams from the Top 5 European Leagues (18-5-0, W-D-L)\n\n(Stats courtesy ESPN Stats & Information Group)",

                "text": "Enzo Maresca believes he can win the Premier League with Chelsea as he hits back at claims that the club lack ambition. (1:16)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Premier League title race moved that much closer in Liverpool's favor after Arsenal's loss to West Ham United, and Chelsea's backslide away from UEFA Champions League qualification got worse, courtesy of Aston Villa's new January signings.\n\nMeanwhile, the LaLiga race in Spain is tightening up thanks to wins by Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. In the Bundesliga, Dortmund's lopsided win over Union Berlin was the biggest surprise in a weekend full of them in Germany.\n\nSam Tighe, Alex Kirkland and Constantin Eckner look across Europe for the big takeaways and highlights from the weekend.\n\nTop takeaway: Chelsea sunk again as Villa's new additions sparkle\n\nAston Villa were the Premier League's busiest club during the January transfer window, adding five new players to a squad that needed a lift. Two of those five -- Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio, signed on loan from Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain, respectively -- felt like genuine marquee additions, and it hasn't taken them long to make their presence felt.\n\nRashford set up Asensio twice on Saturday as Villa came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1, with the winner coming in the 89th minute. It felt fitting that it was the new Marco-Marcus combination that sealed the game for Villa, as it's clear these two players in particular have found a new lease of life under manager Unai Emery.\n\nAdmittedly, the second of those two strikes was a touch fortunate -- it required a helping hand from Blues goalkeeper Filip J\u00f6rgensen, who allowed a hopeful effort to squirm through him and over the line. That really was the last thing Blues manager Enzo Maresca needed, given how much focus there has been on who he selects between the sticks this season.\n\nJust as concerning is Chelsea's run of form since Dec. 22: They've lost double the number of games (six) than they've won during that time, have been knocked out of the FA Cup and have slipped to seventh in the Premier League table. Two months ago, Maresca was trying to keep a lid on expectations and felt forced to play down suggestions his team were in the title race; now he's looking over his shoulder at the likes of Villa, hoping his players can find some form.\n\nBest match: Newcastle United 4-3 Nottingham Forest\n\nThis epic encounter between two Champions League hopefuls began and finished with a flourish. Forest's early lead was wiped out as Newcastle replied with a barrage of four goals, but in the second half they took their foot off the gas. The visitors got one back, then another followed, which led to a frenzied, panicked stoppage-time period as the Magpies held on.\n\nBest goal: Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma vs. Southampton\n\nMitoma finished a subtly brilliant Brighton move that went from the edge of their own box to the back of Southampton's net in fewer than 10 seconds. Adam Webster's super line-breaking pass to Jo\u00e3o Pedro took eight Saints players out of the game, the Brazilian laid it off for Mitoma to take and run with, then the winger sprinted 50 yards before lifting the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper.\n\nSo cool from Kaoru to make it three... \ud83e\udd76\ud83d\udcab pic.twitter.com/WB2aHixUAr \u2014 Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) February 23, 2025\n\nMVP of the weekend: Aaron Wan-Bissaka, West Ham\n\nWest Ham produced a counterattacking clinic in their 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Their tactical approach was typified by Wan-Bissaka, who won more duels (nine) and completed more dribbles (three) than anyone else on the pitch. It was his long run and cross that created the winner, nodded home by Jarrod Bowen. -- Tighe\n\nTop takeaway: Bar\u00e7a, Madrid, Atleti all win to keep title race tight\n\nWe've reached the stage of the season where, as Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said on Saturday, \"You can't slip up.\" And this weekend, none of the big three -- Barcelona, Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid -- did, keeping the gap between the title-contending trio at just one point.\n\nFirst up on Saturday it was Atletico, with a tricky away tie at a Valencia team who'd won their previous three games at home. The quality of Antoine Griezmann (as provider) and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (as finisher, with a brace) ensured that run came to an end with a 3-0 win for Atletico, although even coach Diego Simeone admitted he couldn't understand why Valencia hadn't been given a penalty for Javi Gal\u00e1n's handball.\n\nLater on, there was a potentially difficult game for Barcelona, away at Las Palmas. Hansi Flick's team were made to work hard before Dani Olmo opened the scoring with some deft footwork after an hour. It was Olmo's first goal since November, and it helped Bar\u00e7a win 2-0, staying top of the table. But right alongside them on 54 points are Real Madrid, who beat Girona 2-0 thanks to an all-timer from Luka Modric (see below) and a late second from Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, set up by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nSo -- thanks to key players, stepping up in key moments -- there's no change at the top. More and more, this has the feeling of a title race that will go right down to the wire.\n\nBest match: Athletic Club 7-1 Real Valladolid\n\nIt wasn't the most competitive encounter -- quite the opposite -- but there was plenty of entertainment and spectacle in Athletic's ruthless thrashing of relegation-bound Valladolid at San Mam\u00e9s. Much of it was provided by Nico Williams, with two goals -- one of them after a Maradona-esque dribble across the box -- plus an early assist. There was also yet another goal for the underrated Oihan Sancet, LaLiga's top scoring Spaniard with 13 goals.\n\nBest goal: Luka Modric vs. Girona\n\nThere were multiple goal-of-the-weekend contenders among Athletic's seven goals, but Modric's first-half strike at the Bernab\u00e9u was undeniable. After Rodrygo's corner was headed clear, Modric chested the ball down, allowing it to bounce once before firing a vicious shot past a stunned Paulo Gazzaniga. It was Modric's fourth goal of the season in all competitions, and -- this is saying something -- one of the best of the 39-year-old's long career.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Antoine Griezmann, Atletico Madrid\n\nJulian Alvarez might have scored twice in Atletico's win at Valencia, but it was Griezmann who set them on the way to victory with two inspired, incisive passes to help create both goals. Griezmann's form has been questioned in recent weeks, with an unusual lack of end product, but Diego Simeone's faith in him is unwavering, and this is why. -- Kirkland\n\nTop takeaway: Dortmund win for the first time with Niko Kova\u010d at the helm\n\nOn a weekend full of surprises -- as Freiburg thrashed Bremen and Augsburg upset M\u00f6nchengladbach -- Dortmund's 6-0 win over Union Berlin takes the cake.\n\nWhile Union are among the weaker sides in the league and have shown barely any progress since Steffen Baumgart was hired as manager, Dortmund had been struggling in the first few weeks with Niko Kova\u010d at the helm. Hence, the clear victory at Signal Iduna Park, with Serhou Guirassy scoring four goals and Pascal Gross providing four assists, gives the Schwarzgelben a much-needed breather.\n\nplay 2:11 Guirassy scores 4 as Dortmund thrashes Union Berlin Serhou Guirassy scores four goals as Borussia Dortmund beat FC Union Berlin 6-0 at the Westfalenstadion.\n\nRecent losses have minimised Dortmund's chances of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, which has been their goal for the season. Still, Kova\u010d is under pressure to prove himself, as are many of Dortmund's highly paid players.\n\nSaturday's game could also boost Gio Reyna's confidence. The U.S. men's national team player was granted a spot in the starting XI because Julian Brandt, who usually plays as Dortmund's No. 10 had to be replaced on short notice. Reyna played for 70 minutes and did not impress as much as his fellow midfielders Karim Adeyemi and Maximilian Beier. But it was a step in the right direction for the 22-year-old -- just like for the entire team.\n\nBest match: Leipzig 2-2 Heidenheim\n\nThe early game on Sunday could have almost ended in a huge upset. Heidenheim, who are 16th in the league, scored two early goals at Red Bull Arena, but Leipzig recovered from these setbacks and saved one point thanks to their striker pair -- Lo\u00efs Openda and Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko. Still, the Marco Rose-led side remain on the wrong trajectory.\n\nBest goal: Kiliann Sildillia vs. Bremen\n\nThe right-back opened the scoring Friday night, as a corner kick looped up into the air after a header at the front post. Sildillia saw his chance to not only score the lead but also inject himself into the highlight reels of this season. He quickly calculated how the ball would fly through the air and then slammed it home with an acrobatic overhead kick.\n\nMVP of the weekend: Borussia Dortmund's Pascal Gross\n\nOne could have almost forgotten how celebrated the former Brighton midfielder was only a couple of months ago. His move from the Premier League to Dortmund seemed like a failure, not so much because of Gross's individual performances but due to the difficult circumstances. The 33-year-old showed what he is capable of against Union Berlin, setting three of the four goals scored by Serhou Guirassy and a late goal by Maximilian Beier. -- Eckner\n\nWhat else you missed this weekend\n\nYet another penalty fiasco in Serie A\n\nUdinese beat Lecce 1-0 on Friday night courtesy of a 32nd-minute Lorenzo Lucca penalty. You'd think manager Kosta Runjai\u0107 would be delighted with that, right? Wrong. He was absolutely furious.\n\nLucca is not the Bianconeri's designated penalty taker, so it was a shock to everyone when he strode up to the spot confidently, ball in hand, intent on taking it. Five minutes passed as a cluster of teammates begged him to hand the duties over to regular taker Florian Thauvin. Somewhere in the middle of that, Lucca was booked by the referee because he was effectively timewasting.\n\nEventually, everyone stepped away and let Lucca rifle the penalty in the top corner expertly. Considering the drama and the wait, it really was a ludicrously good spot kick. He celebrated alone, many of his teammates actively avoiding going near him, and he was then promptly substituted in the 36th minute.\n\n\"We have hierarchies,\" Runjai\u0107 growled after the game. \"I don't like those who don't respect the rules, so I had to take measures.\" -- Tighe\n\nAssane Diao and Nico Paz star for Como in win over Napoli\n\nAssane Diao's impact since joining Como last month has been remarkable. The winger, 19, had looked an intriguing prospect in Spain at Real Betis. But he'd scored just one goal in 10 LaLiga appearances this season. Now, Diao already has five goals in eight Serie A games for Como, the latest coming in their 2-1 win over title-chasing Napoli on Sunday.\n\nThe defeat cements a crisis for Antonio Conte's Napoli, who haven't won in their last four Serie A games. And Como's win means they've picked up six points in a week, after beating Fiorentina last weekend. Those points see them climb away from the relegation battle and into mid-table safety. As for Napoli, the former leaders have now dropped to second, behind Inter.\n\nDiao's goal on Sunday was created by another of this season's Serie A revelations -- and another former LaLiga starlet -- Nico Paz. His pass, bisecting the Napoli defence, was controlled well by Diao, who then supplied a composed, low finish into the bottom corner. At Betis, Diao's greatest strength was his dribbling, not his finishing. He now looks like a future all-round attacking star, one who Como signed for just \u20ac12 million. -- Kirkland\n\nOne last win before RVP's arrival in Rotterdam\n\nIt's been quite a few weeks for Pascal Bosschaart, Feyenoord's caretaker manager who was put in charge following Brian Priske's dismissal in early February. In the four games he was leading the team, Feyenoord won four points in the Eredivisie and astonishingly eliminated AC Milan, who had just signed striker Santiago Gim\u00e9nez from Feyenoord, from the UEFA Champions League.\n\nFeyenoord beat Almere City 2-1 on Saturday in what was the only Eredivisie game that day. A stoppage time goal by D\u00e1vid Hancko let the home crowd erupt. It had become clear that this would be Bosschaart's final game as caretaker because prior to it, Robin van Persie, who started and later finished his career at Feyenoord, emerged as the leading candidate for the managerial post. General director Dennis te Kloese was able to get RVP out of his contract with Heerenveen, which was rather easy, given that the former Manchester United and Arsenal star was clearly in favour of yet another return to De Kuip.\n\nAfter all, van Persie is a Rotterdam native, and he might see revitalising the team almost as his duty. However, whether the 41-year-old has the managerial skills to do so at this point remains to be seen. His short-lived tenure as Heerenveen manager was his first senior job in the coaching world. -- Eckner",

Join us for the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip from around the globe.\n\nTransfers homepage | Done deals | Men's January grades | Women's January grades\n\nTOP STORIES\n\n- Sources: Vitor Roque loan from Barcelona to Palmeiras likely off\n\n- Man United announce 200 more redundancies in latest cuts\n\n- Leicester sack two assistants as Van Nistelrooy remains in place\n\nNewcastle and Manchester United are keeping tabs on Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman. Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images\n\nTRENDING RUMORS\n\n- Premier League duo Newcastle United and Manchester United are positioning themselves to sign Atalanta forward Ademola Lookman, according to TEAMtalk. The Magpies are believed to have sent scouts to watch the 27-year-old recently with \"strong\" interest in him, though they could face \"stiff competition\" for the Nigeria international's signature from Man United. Lookman's future with La Dea remains uncertain after a public spat with manager Gian Piero Gasperini, in which the player felt \"deeply disrespected\" after being singled out as \"one of the worst penalty takers\" following a miss against Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League.\n\n- Real Madrid, Liverpool and Manchester City have been given a boost in their pursuit of Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, reports the Daily Mail, with the Bundesliga side having lined up City starlet James McAtee as his replacement. The trio are all believed to be looking at the 21-year-old Germany international and expected to test the waters with a set of bids in the summer. Wirtz has been in impressive form this season, with nine goals and 10 assists in only 23 league appearances.\n\n- Manchester City are interested in FC Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa, according to Foot Mercato. It is reported that the Citizens have already begun talks with the Portuguese Primeira Liga club over a move for the 25-year-old, whom they have identified as a replacement for current starter Ederson amid plans to make several changes to their squad in the next transfer window. Costa, Portugal's first-choice keeper at the international level, is said to be on the radar of \"several\" clubs in Europe.\n\n- Internazionale are set to part ways with forward Joaqu\u00edn Correa in the summer, reports Gazzetta dello Sport. The Nerazzurri are reportedly disappointed with the 30-year-old's performances recently, while injury issues have also seen him struggle to gain a consistent run of matches in the Serie A, having made only two starts this season. Correa's contract at the San Siro is set to expire in June.\n\n- Talks between Tottenham Hotspur and midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur over a new contract have begun, according to the Daily Mail. Spurs are reported to be keen to sign the 27-year-old Uruguay international to new terms, with his current contract set to enter the final 12 months this summer. Bentancur is seen as a key player for manager Ange Postecoglou, and it is said that meetings with his representatives are set to take place in the coming weeks. He has made 16 Premier League appearances this season.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMohun Bagan, champions, of course. An incredible way for one of the great ISL careers to end. The playoff spots beginning to take shape in totality. All that and more in this week's ISL musings:\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures | ISL Playoff Scenarios | ISL Matchweek 22\n\nTo Mohun Bagan is to win\n\nIt's just as simple as that. India's most storied football organization, in its latest avatar, is about just one thing - winning. By attractive means or attritional, Mohun Bagan just know how to get the job done. Of course, one can point to the money spent in assembling this squad of superstars, but that is exactly the kind of ambition that results in league titles won in a dominant fashion.\n\nLet's be real, no ISL team should have the luxury of bringing on Dimi Petratos as an impact sub. Mohun Bagan do. They've got that and more. That's why they've become the first ISL side to breach the 50-point barrier, albeit in the league's longest season yet. That's why the destination of the league shield has been a foregone conclusion for a couple of months now.\n\nDimi Petratos, a Mohun Bagan super giant \ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/c0poL4sHzu - ESPN India (@ESPNIndia) February 23, 2025\n\nThe win to seal the shield, a 1-0 over Odisha FC, was as Mohun Bagan as they come. All season, they've somehow found a way to win. This time, it was a strike from distance by the man the faithful have christened DimiGod, that finally beat an Odisha rearguard that was threatening all night to put this Mariners party on hold for at least a week more.\n\nIt was a season that begin with a bit of turmoil, Jose Molina's attritional safety-first style wasn't turning heads at the maidan. The fans' frustration only turned into anger after they lost the Durand Cup final and then started slowly in the ISL, even losing 3-0 in Bengaluru. However, since then, Molina's machine has just purred along, blips have been few and far between. The first team to retain the ISL league shield are the most dominant table-toppers this league has perhaps ever seen.\n\nHow can your star player go AWOL?\n\nAsk Odisha FC. Ask the best midfielder to grace this league in its decade-long existence. The long and short of it is that Odisha don't know where Ahmed Jahouh is, they just know he's unilaterally decided to leave. No explanation, no reasons given.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd: Ahmed Jahouh has unilaterally left the club without providing any reason or information to the club. The club considers this as a serious breach of contract and is considering an appropriate action. Further details will be communicated once the due process is... pic.twitter.com/9Z6Z42dzr2 - Odisha FC (@OdishaFC) February 22, 2025\n\nIf that is the last we see of Jahouh in the ISL, then it is such an anticlimactic way for his time in India to end. He's been a joyous player to watch ever since Sergio Lobera brought him along to FC Goa in 2017. With his economy of movement and wand of a right foot, Jahouh made football look easy.\n\nIt's no wonder that Lobera took him wherever he went in Indian Football. From Goa to Mumbai to Odisha, the Spanish coach didn't change his general in the middle of the park. Of course, with age, the movement became even more economical, and he sometimes became a luxury in midfield with the legs not quite what they used to be. That didn't make him any less of a joy to watch.\n\nRaking cross-field passes which were pinpoint in their execution, the nonchalant flicks, the supreme understanding of the game unfolding in front of him, and even the occasional temper tantrum on the field, watching Jahouh was always a spectacle, so if he's indeed left these shores with this sort of whimper, it is a sad end to life in India for him.\n\nKratky's changed Mumbai City are not a good watch\n\nThey're tough to beat, they're tough to even score goals against, but one thing that Petr Kratky's Mumbai City FC also are, are tough to watch. It's a weird thing to be saying about this Mumbai City side, who only last season, produced thrilling attacking football on their way to winning the ISL Cup.\n\nVarun / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nSo what has changed this season? They've lost their ball progressor from midfield in Alberto Noguera, and their new overseas recruits haven't quite set the league on fire. Also, the speed of their wingers hasn't really come to the fore against teams who are now willing to take a step back and watch Mumbai move the ball around in front of them, with no penetration.\n\nLallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and Brandon Fernandes have threatened all season to burst out of the attacking malaise surround Mumbai City, only to be sucked right back into it once again.\n\nA defence of their cup will only happen if they improve in attack, but on the plus side, the other half of their game looks in pristine condition. They really do know how to keep clean sheets. Can they do that against the best teams in the league, though?\n\nDon't underestimate the scale of Jamshedpur's achievement\n\nJust as Mohun Bagan's title has looked destined for a couple of months, so has Jamshedpur FC's spot in the playoffs. Now, that is confirmed, Khalid Jamil's side will finish in the top six. It is an incredible achievement for a group of players and manager who weren't given much of a chance before the start of the season, particularly with their recruitment not being high-profile.\n\nJamshedpur FC are a stereotypical Khalid Jamil side, and will be awkward playoff opponents for anyone. Dipayan Bose / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nHowever, this is the stereotypical Jamil team. They are unspectacular to a fault. They run their socks off in every game. They are relatively organised in defence, and in the likes of Javi Hernandez and Javi Siverio, have enough know-how in attacking areas to be a threat at all times.\n\nThat was all perfectly summed up in the win that took them into the playoffs - a 2-0 success over Mohammedan SC away. Jamshedpur had lesser possession than a team bottom of the standings, attempted fewer passes and made more fouls than Mohammedan as well. Jamil has never been one for aesthetics, though. The mission he set out for at the start of the season is now accomplished. They're among the ISL's big boys for certain.\n\nThey're likely to finish in the top four, guaranteeing them a home tie in the knockout playoff round before the semifinal. One thing is for sure, no team wants to be traveling to Jamshedpur for that one, both in terms of the fatigue-inducing travel and the team that they will face.\n\nBig Gurpreet decision pays off for Zaragoza and BFC\n\nFor 14 games starting from mid-October, Bengaluru FC hadn't kept a single clean sheet until their home game against Jamshedpur last week. Now they've got two in a row. Poor Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's worst club season ever took another turn, for better or worse, as he was benched in favour of Lalthuammawia Ralte in goal.\n\nWhether this is a long-term change is immaterial. Gerard Zaragoza finally realised the need to take Gurpreet out of the firing line. Ralte has played his part well enough. His best days won't be as good as Gurpreet's best, of course, but right now, Bengaluru need solidity, a calm presence who doesn't make any mistakes. Ralte did one better in Shillong against NorthEast United, as he made a couple of excellent saves to keep Bengaluru's clean sheet intact, particularly one off an Alaaeddine Ajaraie header, as he threw himself up to his left and palmed the ball onto the crossbar.\n\nHe did pick up an injury late in that game, which makes his presence for the next couple of games a doubt, but at a moment in their season when Bengaluru needed calm, Ralte brought that for them and set the base for six points in two games, which almost certainly wraps up their spot in the playoffs too. Oh, and Alberto Noguera has played a bit of a role in that too. The Spaniard's three goals in the last two games have been such a vital contribution following that run of six winless games.\n\nToo little, too late for East Bengal, but what could have been?\n\nJust like Chennaiyin, East Bengal have now put together two wins in a row, but their playoff hopes are hanging by a thread, needing a number of other results to go their way to even entertain the prospect of playing in the post-season.\n\nDipayan Bose / Focus Sports / FSDL\n\nThis week, they produced a polished attacking display against Punjab FC. Naorem Mahesh Singh was bright out wide, Dimitrios Diamantakos was an imposing presence in the middle. It was all that they'd dreamt of when they spent big money to bring the Greek striker to Kolkata in the summer. It hasn't quite worked out that way.\n\nOscar Bruzon will rue the results they had in January, particularly his usage of Mahesh in a central role, that he clearly seemed out of place in. He's a lovely technical player, is Mahesh, but he couldn't quite come to terms with the challenge of having to transfer those skills from the wide positions to the central areas.\n\nNow, back in his favourite wide area, he's once again having a critical impact on East Bengal's games. For Bruzon, there's a bigger play here too. The ISL playoffs may be out of reach now, but he needs his big players fit and firing for the AFC Challenge League quarterfinal tie against Turkmenistan's Arkadag next week.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 ISL season has reached its business end, with around a month of league stage fixtures left before the playoffs commence in mid-March.\n\nIt has been a competitive season, as this league always seems to produce. As it stands, the 13 teams have all played at least 19 of their allotted 24 league games, and only Mohammedan SC are out of contention for the playoffs. MSC have only managed 11 points from 19 games, in what has turned into a troubled debut ISL campaign.\n\nFor the other 12 teams, there is all to play for in the next month, although that could change for a couple of teams, who need more than just a miracle for them to make it to the playoffs. Here's how each team stands at the moment, and their potential route to the playoffs:\n\nCurrent Points: 52 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: +29\n\nA perfect, record-breaking campaign has seen Mohun Bagan become the first team to defend the League Shield title - after a last-gasp win over Odisha FC courtesy Dimi Petratos. Their last two games have become little more than formalities.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mumbai City (A), FC Goa (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 42 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: +15\n\nA month or so ago, FC Goa fans may have looked at that last league away to Bagan as a shield-decider, but Bagan have just been way too good. The shield is gone for Goa, but their remaining games are no less important. They will love to finish second in the league, but also Marquez knows that his side cannot lose momentum before they go into the playoffs.\n\nRemaining Matches: Punjab FC (A), Mohammedan SC (H), Mohun Bagan (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 37 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -2\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, there was a thought that Jamshedpur could be the ones to really push Bagan for the shield. Losses to Hyderabad, Bengaluru and NorthEast United have snuffed that thought out. However, they have taken a step closer to making it to the playoffs after beating Mohammedan SC 2-0. Bagan's win over Odisha also saw Jamshedpur qualify for the playoffs.\n\nRemaining Matches: Kerala Blasters (A), Odisha FC (H), Chennaiyin FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 34 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: +10\n\nThat win against Jamshedpur at the Kanteerava came at the perfect time for Bengaluru. They'd gotten just a point from six games before that one, so it was a significant result against a team above them on the table. And then they went on to defeat NorthEast United 2-0 which further bolstered their chances making it to playoffs as they moved up the table.\n\nRemaining Matches: Chennaiyin FC (H), East Bengal (A), Mumbai City FC (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 32 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: +10\n\nHow far could they have dreamt if they somehow found some steel and solidity to complement the phenom that Alaaeddine Ajaraie has been this season? The Moroccan has had arguably the greatest individual season in ISL history - and that deserved to be fighting for bigger honours rather than clinging on to a playoff spot. The loss against Bengaluru made it tricky for NorthEast, but positive results against sides below them should do the job.\n\nRemaining Matches: Chennaiyin FC (A), East Bengal (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 32 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: 0\n\nMumbai City have struggled to score goals all season. Only the bottom three have scored fewer than them. However, only Mohun Bagan have conceded less than they have. They've got tough games coming up, as Bagan visit Mumbai before trips to Kochi and Bengaluru. The goalless draw against Hyderabad looked to have put a secure top 6 spot into a precarious position.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mohun Bagan (H), Kerala Blasters (A), Bengaluru FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 29 in 22 games\n\nGoal Difference: +7\n\nTheir season has been a peculiar one, but not particularly difficult to describe. The average age of their foreigners has caught up with them this season. This hasn't been the lively, attacking Sergio Lobera side we've seen for years in the ISL and that drop in pace and intensity has been seen in their results. They're by no means out of contention, but the loss to Bagan has dented most of their hopes.\n\nRemaining Matches: Mohammedan SC (H), Jamshedpur FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -4\n\nLast season's excellent playoff run and what looked like a good summer transfer window hasn't translated to on-pitch results for Owen Coyle and Chennaiyin. They only recently broke a seven-match winless run - one in which they let multiple winning positions slip. They will live to regret those games against Mohammedan away and Odisha at home, come the end of the season. Wins in those instead of draws would've just left four points off sixth place right now, instead of the eight points they find themselves behind by.\n\nRemaining Matches: Bengaluru FC (A), NorthEast United (H), Jamshedpur FC (H)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -4\n\nAt no point in this season has it felt like East Bengal have ever clearly threatened the top six positions. The possibility now is mathematical, but they need a miracle. They need to win all their three remaining games, and hope for monumental slips from multiple teams above them. It is very likely that their wait for a first ISL playoff appearance is likely to continue for another season at least.\n\nRemaining Matches: Hyderabad FC (H), Bengaluru FC (H), NorthEast United (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -5\n\nThe chance they'd given themselves seems to be slipping away, and a 2-0 loss to Goa means they drop to tenth. It's going to be a tough run-in for the Blasters. That away game in Hyderabad is a good chance to get three points, but they'll need to produce some big results before that for that game to be of any consequence.\n\nRemaining Matches: Jamshedpur FC (H), Mumbai City FC (H), Hyderabad FC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 24 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -5\n\nA season that began so promisingly for Punjab has gone a little pear-shaped and now they really don't have much momentum on their side, with three games to go. They're still very much in the race mathematically but will need other results to go in their favour.\n\nRemaining Matches: FC Goa (H), Hyderabad FC (A), Mohammedan SC (A)\n\nCurrent Points: 17 in 21 games\n\nGoal Difference: -21\n\nIt's been a tough season for Hyderabad, even if it has been better than last season. They've had their moments, like the win away in Kerala and at home against Jamshedpur. NorthEast's win over Jamshedpur and their loss to Odisha saw them drop out of contention for the playoff spots.\n\nRemaining Matches: East Bengal (A), Punjab FC (H), Kerala Blasters (H)",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2024-25 season of the Indian Super League is in full swing, and with games coming thick and fast, this is a convenient place to catch up on every match. We'll have a report after every match, right up to the rest day signalling the end of the matchweek.\n\nISL Standings | ISL Results and Fixtures | ISL Playoff Scenarios\n\nThe report on all matches from matchweek 21 is here.\n\nHere are the details for matchweek 22 of ISL 2024-25 with the latest match report coming first:\n\nMohun Bagan 1-0 Odisha FC\n\n(Dimitrios Petratos - 90'+3')\n\nMohun Bagan Super Giant became the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024-25 League winners after their 1-0 victory against Odisha FC at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan Stadium, Kolkata tonight.\n\nBagan successfully defended their title, first-ever team in ISL to do so, as they moved to 52 points after this triumph, gaining an unassailable lead over the second-placed FC Goa, who have bagged 42 points with three games to spare. The Jose Molina-coached team sealed this victory on the back of 16 victories and four draws, while recording their sixth consecutive clean sheet -- the most ever done by a team in the competition.\n\nDimitrios Petratos scored a dramatic winner in the added time -- a powerful and precise shot from outside the box, which rattled the bottom left corner of the goal, finally beating Amrinder Singh's resistance.\n\nFC Goa 2 - 0 Kerala Blasters\n\n(Guarrotxena 46', Yasir 73')\n\nGoa absolutely dominated the Blasters in a performance that meant Mohun Bagan are not yet league shield champions. After a first half where they were all over the Blasters but goalless (Carl McHugh a big culprit with a miss of a free header), Manolo Marquez's men came out all guns firing in the second and were rewarded inside the first minute as Iker Guarrotxena scored a pearler.\n\nMohammad Yasir made it two off a tap-in after more excellent work from Guarrotxena down the left. The result sees Goa remain second, seven points behind Bagan while Blasters dropped to 10th, behind both Chennaiyin and East Bengal on goal difference.\n\nPunjab FC 1-3 East Bengal\n\n(Dimitrios Diamantakos 15', Naorem Mahesh Singh 47', Lalchungnunga 54', Ezequiel Vidal 62')\n\nEast Bengal have managed to keep their playoff hopes alive with a 3-1 win over Punjab FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi on Saturday.\n\nIt was a dominating performance by the Kolkata team who took a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Dimitrios Diamantakos, Naorem Mahesh Singh and Lalchungnunga. Punjab pulled one back thanks to Ezequiel Vidal in the second half but that was the only consolation for them in the match.\n\nWith the win, East Bengal moved up to 10th spot after 24 points from 21 matches. Punjab are down a place below with same points but lesser in terms of goal difference. Both teams still have a slim chance of making it to the playoffs but they need other results to go in their favour.\n\nNorthEast United FC 0-2 Bengaluru FC\n\n(Ryan Williams 3', Alberto Noguera 81')\n\nBengaluru FC defeated NorthEast United FC 2-0 at home thanks to an early goal from Ryan Williams and Alberto Noguera's late strike, which took them to fourth spot in the table.\n\nThis was Bengaluru's second consecutive clean sheet and it came in a match where they held only 37.3% of the possession, but scored twice out of the four shots that they took on target\n\nBengaluru FC built strong momentum from the onset, holding the ball, and making inroads into the defence with ease, which helped them strike very early in the game. Noguera, coming on the back of a brace against Jamshedpur FC, pulled off a slick pass for Williams and the latter slotted it into the bottom left corner to open the scoring.\n\nAlaaeddine Ajaraie, this season's record goal scorer, couldn't get one going today despite a good attempt in the 18th minute. The striker, positioned at the heart of the penalty box, made a thumping header that was saved at the high centre of the goal by Lalthuammawia Ralte\n\nThe second half of the match began with a similar pattern of back-and-forth exchanges, as both teams battled to find their rhythm to assert their gameplay.\n\nTowards the end, Bengaluru FC pushed numbers ahead to find the second goal. This led to a rather scrambled situation inside the NorthEast United FC box as the visitors struggled to get hold of the ball. However, the hosts were equally disoriented and Noguera pounced upon this moment of uncertainty by latching upon a loose ball at the centre of the box with his left foot to drill it into the bottom left corner and get another strike in the 81st minute.\n\nMohammedan SC 0-2 Jamshedpur FC\n\n(Ritwik Das 6', Nikhil Barla 82')\n\nJamshedpur have taken a big step towards sealing the qualification playoff with a 2-0 win over Mohammedan SC in their Indian Super League match at Kolkata's Kishore Bharati Krirangan stadium.\n\nThe goals came from Ritvik Das and Nikhil Barla as they Jamshedpur returned to winning ways after losing their previous two matches against Bengaluru FC and NorthEast United.\n\nKhalid Jamil's side, currently third on the table, has 37 points from 21 matches, which is five more than fourth-placed NorthEast United. Jamshedpur's next opponents are Kerala Blasters whom they will play on March 1.\n\nHyderabad FC 0-0 Mumbai City FC\n\nHyderabad FC earned their first clean sheet in 15 games thanks to a superb performance from goalkeeper Arshdeep Singh, pulling off a 0-0 draw against Mumbai City FC. The point took Mumbai above Bengaluru into fifth place, but opened the door for Odisha - three points behind in seventh - to catch them\n\nMumbai had an early chance when Lallianzuala Chhangte drew a save from Arshdeep Singh from a narrow angle after being put through in the left channel in the box by Jon Toral. The visitors ought to have scored in the 17th minute, when after a cross from the right, Mehtab Singh was free at the far post, but saw his header cannon off the bar. Jon Toral even had a goal ruled out for offside, which would have stood had Chhangte not got a headed touch before the Spaniard tapped it into the net.\n\nHyderabad somehow kept it goalless midway through the first half with Arshdeep Singh making a string of saves, including one from Chhangte that the winger claimed had cross the line, but replays were inconclusive. Late in the half, Vikram Partap Singh was put through on goal with a clever lofted pass, but blazed over with the goal at his mercy. At the other end, Ramhlunchhunga Hmar drew a good save from Phurba Lachenpa from a free-kick in Hyderabad's sole threatening action in a one-sided first half.\n\nThe hosts did ask questions of Mumbai a few minutes before the hour mark, after coming close with headers from a set-piece while replays also showed contact as Stefan Sapic was hauled down in the box. Hyderabad nearly scored in the 64th minute when Devendra Murgaokar ran onto a long ball and evaded Lachenpa's challenge, but had lost his balance and could not strike the ball on target. Jorge Ortiz's search for a first goal in Mumbai colours almost came to an end in the 69th minute, only for Arshdeep to make an incredible save from point-blank range after the striker had space and time in the box. Ortiz ought to have scored ten minutes later when Arshdeep spilled a cross into his path, but Manoj Mohammed and Sapic cleared off the line, with the goalkeeper not in the picture. Manoj made another crucial tackle, preventing Chhangte from striking on goal after the Mumbai superstar had run clear. Ultimately, Hyderabad held on for the draw, with Mumbai set to reflect on a game they ought to have won.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMohun Bagan. ISL League Shield Champions. Dimi Petratos with the title-winning goal. A dominant, inevitable winning machine.\n\nAll acceptable platitudes after Mohun Bagan defeated Odisha FC with a last-gasp goal to win the 2024/25 Indian Super League title on Sunday -- except those were words from last year. Somehow, incredibly, the most winning-est club in Indian football history decided to up the ante and perfect their winning formula.\n\nDimi Petratos, their talisman from last season, came on as a substitute. Read that again. A substitute. Dimi Petratos. The most clutch ISL player ever. Substitute. In a title-winning clash.\n\nThe result? Petratos did what he does, the moment of magic emanating from his left-foot with a 93rd-minute turn and strike from range, and Bagan defeated 10-man Odisha to confirm their title, 52 points now beyond Goa's reach. And they did it in historic fashion - as Bagan became the first-ever team in ISL history to defend the league shield title.\n\nHow did they get there?\n\nIt started, in typical maidan fashion, by letting go of their coach. As much as the club couched it as 'health reasons' for parting with the most successful manager in ISL history -- Antonio Habas -- his subsequent spell in charge of I-League club Inter Kashi proved otherwise.\n\nThere were rusted parts in the Bagan winning machine last year, as evidenced by the loss to Mumbai City FC in the 2023/24 ISL final.\n\nAnd thus, the Bagan management brought back another ISL-winning coach from their ATK past - Jose Molina. The Spaniard came in and applied his magic oil to all of Bagan's rusted parts and fashioned a side that's close to perfect.\n\nConsider the records they've broken this season:\n\nFirst team in ISL history to breach the 50-point mark.\n\nMost-ever wins in a season (16 and counting.)\n\nMost home wins in a season (10 and counting.)\n\nMost set-piece goals in a season (20 and counting.)\n\nMost clean sheets in a season (14 and counting.)\n\nFirst team ever to keep six clean sheets in a row.\n\nIt didn't all go smoothly at the start however - Bagan were dealing with a controversial transfer of first-choice centre-back, Anwar Ali to rivals East Bengal, and a defence that had a concerning habit of giving up leads --] which even saw them lose the Durand Cup final. The departures of Joni Kauko and Brendan Hamill looked costly initially, especially after a 0-3 loss to Bengaluru FC early on. A season's worth of fine-tuning under Molina though, and Ali, Kauko and Hamill's departure is merely a footnote, and Bagan boast of the best defence in India - by far.\n\nThe raw numbers are frankly ridiculous - reducing the number of goals the champions conceded by 46% is unheard of. For comparison, Arsenal had the best defence in England last year (29 goals conceded), and a similar reduction would have seen them concede 13 goals in 38 games -- which would be a Premier League record (they've conceded 23 in 26 games so far).\n\nThe Mohun Bagan faithful celebrate with a faux ISL League Shield. ISL\n\nSubhasish Bose, Alberto Rodriguez and Tom Aldred have been key cogs of a miserly backline that has snuffed out the best of ISL attacks, but what Molina has added to the mix is their utility as set-piece goalscoring threats. For a while, Bose was the top-scoring Indian in the league, and has already achieved the feat of most goals by a defender in an ISL season (6), with Rodriguez equalling the previous record of five. The pair have accounted for a quarter of Bagan's goals this season - which is saying something given their attacking riches.\n\nListon Colaco, Jason Cummings, Greg Stewart have all chipped in with brilliant moments when called upon. Jamie MacLaren has been patient and eventually turned into the X-Factor for this side. The Australian scored match-winning goals in six games and Bagan have won each of the eight games he's scored in. And yet, it was about Dimi Petratos and his magic dust, once more.\n\nIt became a familiar theme for the season -- Molina had kept things simple for his side. Concede less, score via magic from a forward, win games. A simple formula, as he said before the game, saying \"We have to do the same thing we have been doing from the beginning -- work hard, defend, attack, and stay united as a team, attacking and defending together, trying to concede as few goals as possible, trying to score as many goals as possible, and finally, try to win and get the three points.\"\n\nThat platform, and Vishal Kaith's transformation into the best goalkeeper in the land meant Bagan's forwards always had the freedom to keep taking high-risk high-reward options time after time. Inevitably, 90 (and more) minutes in, one of their multitude of difference makers would get it right.\n\nDimi Petratos did get it right for Bagan tonight, and Bagan got it right all season. And that's why they are champions. Perfect champions.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nMANCHESTER, England -- Liverpool took a giant step closer to winning the Premier League title with a 2-0 win on Sunday at outgoing champions Manchester City, moving 11 points clear at the top of the table.\n\nMohamed Salah's 30th goal of the season in all competitions and a Dominik Szoboszlai strike sealed a victory that was much more comfortable than the scoreline suggests.\n\nFor Man City, who were without the injured Erling Haaland, the loss leaves them facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League.\n\nCity are now in fourth position, 20 points behind Liverpool, and in a race with Newcastle, Bournemouth, Chelsea and Aston Villa for a Champions League spot.\n\nWas this the weekend Liverpool won the 2024-25 Premier League?\n\nIf Arsenal had beaten West Ham on Saturday and Liverpool had failed to beat City on Sunday, the title would have been in Arsenal's hands. Mikel Arteta's Gunners would have been five points behind with a game in hand and a trip to Anfield to come in May.\n\nInstead, Arsenal lost to West Ham, Liverpool won at the Etihad and the gap at the top of the table has widened to 11 points. From here, it's difficult to see anyone other than Liverpool being crowned champions at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal once overturned a 13-point deficit to beat Manchester United to the title in the 1997-98 campaign. But that was in December with more than half the season left to play. Arne Slot's Liverpool have only 11 games remaining, and nine more wins would guarantee the title, regardless of any winning run Arsenal can put together.\n\nLiverpool have games against Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal to negotiate, but they can afford to lose two and still finish top. In stoppage time, the Liverpool fans began singing, \"We're going to win the league.\" It's hard to argue with their assessment. -- Rob Dawson\n\nMan City don't win when it matters like they used to\n\nManchester City are no longer the team for the big occasion, but this defeat against Liverpool wasn't the definitive proof of that, merely the latest example of how Pep Guardiola's team has lost the ability to win when it matters.\n\nIf you look back through City's results since the end of the 2022-23 season, when they won the treble, they haven't won a single game when the pressure was on. Not since beating Inter Milan in the 2023 Champions League final, in fact.\n\nLast season, City failed to beat Liverpool or Arsenal in the Premier League, and it has been the same this time around. As for the Champions League, City have had four games against Real Madrid since winning the competition and not won any of them. And in last season's FA Cup final against Manchester United, despite being overwhelming favourites to beat their neighbours and clinch a league and cup double, Guardiola's team lost.\n\nSo, when Liverpool arrived at the Etihad looking for their first win at the Etihad in seven years, Slot's side would have regarded City with far less fear and trepidation as before. City have been woeful this season and have lost 14 of their past 27 games in all competitions, but it is their failure to compete against the biggest and best sides that has been an issue for a while now.\n\nGuardiola's teams were always the ones that won when it mattered, but they haven't done that now for almost two years. -- Mark Ogden\n\nSlot achieves something Klopp never could\n\nIn his first season leading Liverpool, Slot is already on course to match Jurgen Klopp's title haul, and has already ticked off something his predecessor never managed.\n\nKlopp's rivalry with Guardiola characterised a Premier League era, but the German never recorded a league win over Guardiola's City at the Etihad Stadium. Slot has done it at his first attempt. Klopp would probably argue that he never faced a Guardiola team that was languishing 20 points off the top of the table, though.\n\nIt was a very comfortable win for Mohamed Salah and Liverpool over Manchester City, a result that might seal the title for Liverpool and push Man City out of Champions League qualification. PAUL ELLIS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt's remarkable that Klopp led Liverpool to 97 points in 2018-19 and 92 points in 2021-22 and finished second on both occasions. Slot, though, can beat only what's in front of him. Liverpool were comfortable winners here, just as they were over City at Anfield in December.\n\nIt says everything about where these two teams are this season that Liverpool were able to cruise past Real Madrid in the Champions League group phase in November. City, on the other hand, were well beaten at the Bernabeu on Wednesday as they made their exit from Europe.\n\nSlot has Liverpool chasing three trophies in what could end up being a dream season. Guardiola, meanwhile, is left facing the prospect of a summer rebuild. -- Dawson\n\nMan City's young team learns a harsh lesson\n\nWith the experience of R\u00faben Dias, Mateo Kovacic, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan left on the bench, Guardiola fielded a young team. They got a lesson from Liverpool, who produced the perfect big-game performance away from home.\n\nDisciplined and clinical, Liverpool were the better team and could have scored more. After the chastening trip to Madrid, Guardiola decided he needed the legs and energy of youth and picked a starting XI with an average age of 24.7. Seven members of the team were 24 or under. Guardiola also picked three 20-year-olds in Rico Lewis, Savinho and Abdukodir Khusanov and his first substitution was to replace 33-year-old Kevin De Bruyne with 22-year-old James McAtee.\n\nThere's plenty of talent in City's core of young players, but there is naturally going to be an element of naivety. In particular, Guardiola will be furious with Liverpool's first goal. It came from a well-worked corner routine with Alexis Mac Allister rolling a pass into the near post and Szoboszlai flicking it on and Salah finding acres of space in the penalty area to score via a deflection from Nathan Ak\u00e9.\n\nIt was a crucial moment in the game and one where City's relative lack of experience was telling. -- Dawson\n\nDe Bruyne is fading fast\n\nKevin De Bruyne will go down as a blue-chip Premier League legend thanks to his incredible 10 years at Manchester City, but we are watching the final days of the midfielder's time at the Etihad, and it is becoming a sad farewell for the 33-year-old.\n\nDe Bruyne, who has won 14 major honours including six Premier League titles with City, was substituted halfway through the second half by Guardiola after a nightmare performance against Liverpool. The Belgium international was wayward with his passes and couldn't keep pace with Liverpool's dynamic midfield of Ryan Gravenberch and Mac Allister.\n\nWhen he was replaced by James McAtee it was inevitable, and his disconsolate walk to the touchline summed up De Bruyne's frustration. Four days before this game, De Bruyne was named as a substitute in City's must-win -- they lost -- Champions League playoff second leg against Real Madrid, and he has been a peripheral figure throughout this season.\n\nWith his contract due to expire in the summer and no new deal on the table, De Bruyne is fading fast. City have lots of problems to address, but replacing one of their best-ever players will be close to the top of the list. -- Ogden\n\nSalah is to Liverpool what Haaland has been to City\n\nSalah took his goal tally for the season to 30 with the opener for Liverpool at the Etihad, and he also became the first player in Europe's big five leagues to register 50 goal involvements this term by creating the second for Szoboszlai. Even though we still have three months of the season to play, Salah is now just two goal involvements away from breaking Luis Su\u00e1rez's club record of 43 in the Premier League.\n\nThere are no more superlatives left to describe Salah and his importance to Liverpool, who are cruising to the title. The Egypt international seems a certainty to win the individual Player of the Year awards and he will rival all of Real Madrid's star players for this year's Ballon d'Or.\n\nBut with Erling Haaland missing this game for Manchester City due to a knee injury, Salah's contribution showed how he is as important to Liverpool as Haaland is to City. Guardiola's side lacks a threat without Haaland, but because Salah rarely misses a game, we don't really know how Liverpool would cope without him.\n\nWith Salah's contract due to expire this summer, Liverpool really need to sort a new deal with the forward to delay having to find out what life without him could be like. -- Ogden",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLIVERPOOL, England -- For 72 minutes, Manchester United were totally outclassed by Everton at Goodison Park and well on their way to a 13th Premier League defeat of the season. With no shots on goal and 2-0 down as the minutes ticked over, they were dead and buried. Until they weren't.\n\nFootball always has the capacity to surprise and Bruno Fernandes' superb free kick sparked the unlikeliest of comebacks from Ruben Amorim's side as Manuel Ugarte struck an equalizer with only their second shot on goal. Both teams then threatened to find a winner -- and United had VAR to thank for overturning a late penalty given for a shirt pull on Ashley Young -- before the spoils were shared in a breathless 2-2 draw.\n\nAhead of the match, Amorim conceded that Everton boss David Moyes -- who spent 10 months in charge at Old Trafford following Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013 -- had done a \"better job\" of reversing his team's fortunes after joining the club midseason.\n\nBefore Saturday, United had won just four of their 14 league games under Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm back in November. Moyes, meanwhile, has excelled in his second spell at Goodison (having previously managed the club for more than a decade between 2002 and '13), winning four of his first six games in charge following Sean Dyche's dismissal last month. And, for well over an hour on Saturday, Moyes looked set to bolster that impressive record further with another victory against United.\n\nFrom the outset on Merseyside, it was clear to see which was the in-form team, with blue shirts quickly swarming the United players as they tried to play out from the back. Everton were rewarded for their dynamic start when Beto drilled the ball past goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana inside 19 minutes after United spurned a number of opportunities to clear their lines from a corner.\n\nIt was a fifth goal in four games for the once-maligned Beto, who had managed just four goals in 44 appearances before Moyes' arrival. His transformation from also-ran to one of the Premier League's most prolific finishers is just one example of how Everton, to a man, have stood up to be counted in times of adversity.\n\nUnited, by contrast, have wilted under the pressure of the past few months. They looked set to continue that trend when Everton doubled their advantage through Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, who outjumped Harry Maguire to nod the ball home after Onana had made a decent save from Jack Harrison.\n\nThe home fans took great pleasure in taunting their visitors with chants of \"going down\"; United went in at the interval without a shot on target in a rudderless first-half display that yielded an expected goals (xG) value of 0.04.\n\nIt was more of the same after the break, and Everton came close to making it 3-0 when Doucoure's fine half-volley was tipped to safety by Onana. Surely there was no way back from one of the club's worst performances of the season.\n\n\"I'm sitting here and I don't know if I have seen a United team this bad,\" former United defender Rio Ferdinand said while commentating on TNT Sports. \"It has been embarrassing in all different facets of the game. Yes, we can talk about quality, you talk about talent, but one thing which is unforgiveable is a lack of desire.\"\n\nManchester United had a woeful game before Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte turned things around. Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\n\nFernandes' desire, though, helped drag United back into the game late on. The club captain -- as has so often been the case since he arrived from Sporting CP back in 2020 -- set an example for his teammates in the middle of the park and, after bending an excellent strike past the rooted Jordan Pickford, he began to pull the strings in an increasingly edgy contest as United drove forward.\n\nWhen defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte equalised with a stunning drive from the edge of the area 10 minutes from time, it was hard to argue that it hadn't been coming. United even looked like they could go on and win it, with substitute Alejandro Garnacho causing plenty of problems for the tiring Everton defence.\n\nBut the football gods decreed that it was the hosts who nearly had the final say, as referee Andrew Madley awarded a stoppage-time penalty for a perceived foul by Harry Maguire on Young as Onana pushed the ball out. After a VAR intervention, however, Madley was sent to the pitchside monitor and reversed his decision, with Moyes describing the call to deny his team a spot-kick as \"surprising.\"\n\n\"We had our chances in the second half, but the problem is that we started the game too late,\" Fernandes told TNT Sports after the game. \"We need to start games better, we know that. We had to stick to the plan, that's what [Amorim] was very upset with us about. In the second half we stuck to our ideas and played with much more freedom and movement.\"\n\nWith United still languishing in 15th place -- just 13 points clear of the relegation zone, a point against Everton hardly constitutes a transformational result for the 20-time league champions.\n\nBut the fighting spirit displayed by Amorim's men in the final third of the game on Merseyside must now be the benchmark for their performances in the remainder of the season.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOf the 10 highest-rated games so far this season, four of them were played by Liverpool, showing just how high Liverpool's ceiling is compared to the rest of the Premier League. Xinhua via Getty Images\n\nWe live in aggregates because we have to. At least, that's how the Premier League awards its champion. You play 38 games, one home and away against everyone, and whoever accrues the best combination of three-point wins and one-point draws gets to lift the trophy. If, somehow, there's still a tie, then we look to another aggregate: the differential between goals scored and conceded across those 38 games.\n\nUnlike in tournament-based competitions, the best team -- on aggregate, by points won -- always wins the league.\n\nOf course, in a single moment, no team is exactly its aggregate. No, each team is performing somewhere along the spectrum of matches -- good, bad, or average -- that add up to make its aggregate.\n\nTake Liverpool's match with Wolves last weekend. At halftime, the league leaders were on pace to win 4-0 -- well ahead of their seasonlong aggregate of plus-1.3 per game. Then, in the second half, they got outshot 10-0 and were outscored 1-0. Two vastly different halves add up to a performance well below their 25-game aggregate.\n\nAt this point in the season, the league table and each team's goal differential do a pretty good job of summarizing the average performance level of all 20 teams in England's top flight. But it doesn't really tell you anything about how they got there -- including the top end of what teams have proven capable of this season.\n\nToday, we're going to move beyond the aggregates. To do so, we've ranked all 20 Premier League teams, in order, by how good their best game was, which in turn tells us how high each team's ceiling is.\n\nThe methodology\n\nAs I've written about before, analysis from Ben Torvaney -- formerly of AC Milan and now working for Liverpool's former head of research, Ian Graham, at the consultancy Ludonautics -- found that the best goal-based metric for assessing team quality was a blend of 70% expected goals and 30% goals.\n\nI like this, particularly, because it's pretty intuitive. Hook any soccer manager, or fan, or player, up to a lie detector, and they'll admit that creating better chances than your opponent is the main objective in a match. But it's also not the only thing.\n\nWhen the score changes, teams switch up their objectives. And, of course, the ability to convert your chances and prevent your opponent from doing the same is important -- if not as important as the ability to generate the chances in the first place.\n\nBased on Torvaney's metric, here's how the league sorts out through 25 matches:\n\nThese ratings are adjusted slightly for the quality of the opposition and for home-field advantage. By the 70-30 metric, home teams average plus-0.37 per game, while away teams, of course, average the inverse.\n\nAnd so, this is the metric we'll be using to determine each team's best performance in a match this season: 70% expected goals, 30% actual goals, adjusted for the location of the match and the quality of the opponent.\n\nAll data comes from FBref and Stats Perform.\n\n- 0.88 adjusted rating (0.74 performance, plus 0.14 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Tottenham on Nov. 10, 2024\n\n- Score: 2-1\n\n- xG: 1.6-1.5\n\nThe \"performance\" rating here is 0.37 for the xG and goals, plus another 0.37 because Ipswich were on the road. (Home teams lose 0.37 from their performance rating.) And then it gets a further boost of plus-0.14 because that's Tottenham's rating so far this season.\n\nConsider this Ipswich's ceiling: a 2-1 away win where the chances were roughly equal against the 12th-placed team in the table.\n\n- 1.23 adjusted rating (1.09 performance, plus 0.14 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Tottenham on Jan. 26, 2025\n\n- Score: 2-1\n\n- xG: 1.6-1.0\n\nWhile this is meant to be an exercise in showcasing each team's ceiling, we're also seeing which team might have the lowest floor in the league, too.\n\n- 1.28 adjusted rating (0.68 performance, plus 0.60 opponent)\n\n- Home vs. Bournemouth on Oct. 26, 2024\n\n- Score: 1-1\n\n- xG: 1.8-0.3\n\nWhile Unai Emery is one of the best cup managers of his generation, he has never quite had the same level of success in league play, in part, because he has been unwilling to dial up the variance and play the kinds of more open matches that might allow his teams to dominate more often but also occasionally get upset. See: Villa finishing top eight in the Champions League's league phase and landing 18th on this list.\n\n- 1.42 adjusted rating (2.37 performance, minus 0.95 opponent)\n\n- Home vs. Leicester City on Feb. 1, 2025\n\n- Score: 4-0\n\n- xG: 2.5-0.3\n\nAnd we have our first dominant win over a bad team. Since Leicester have a minus-0.95 rating for the season, that gets subtracted from Everton's overall rating for this match.\n\n- 1.49 adjusted rating (1.12 performance, plus 0.37 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Newcastle Utd on Aug. 17, 2024\n\n- Score: 1-0\n\n- xG: 1.8-0.3\n\nAnd we have our first and only ... loss? When this happened on the opening weekend, we all should've known this wouldn't be Southampton's year.\n\n- 1.62 adjusted rating (2.63 performance, minus 1.01 opponent)\n\n- Home vs. Ipswich Town on Oct. 5, 2024\n\n- Score: 4-1\n\n- xG: 3.6-0.6\n\n- 1.66 adjusted rating (1.48 performance, plus 0.18 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Fulham on Nov. 23, 2024\n\n- Score: 4-1\n\n- xG: 1.3-1.0\n\n- 1.67 adjusted rating (1.16 performance, plus 0.51 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Chelsea on Dec. 26, 2024\n\n- Score: 2-1\n\n- xG: 1.8-1.1\n\nFulham are the best team in the bottom 10 of these rankings. But when your leading non-penalty goal scorer is Alex Iwobi, who really has developed into a nice midfielder but whose main skill is moving the ball toward the opposition box and creating chances for others, your ceiling can only be so high.\n\n- 1.68 adjusted rating (1.90 performance, minus 0.22 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Everton on Aug. 17, 2024\n\n- Score: 3-0\n\n- xG: 1.4-0.5\n\nThere's no red-card adjustment in these ratings, and this was the game when Kaoru Mitoma nearly made Ashley Young retroactively retire five years ago. Brighton played more than 20 minutes of their first game of the season up a man. Throw that into the mix, and Brighton's best game was really last week's 3-0 win at home to Chelsea (1.4 xG to 0.5).\n\nUncoincidentally, Brighton's best games are the ones when Mitoma briefly becomes the best player in the Premier League.\n\n- 1.88 adjusted rating (2.02 performance, minus 0.14 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Manchester United on Feb. 2, 2025\n\n- Score: 2-0\n\n- xG: 2.6-1.1\n\nA dominant, multigoal win at Old Trafford ... only lands you in 11th place on this list.\n\nplay 1:20 Should Manchester United prioritise the cup competitions? ESPN FC Live's Mark Donaldson is joined by Shaka Hislop to discuss what competitions Ruben Amorim's Manchester United should prioritise.\n\n- 2.02 adjusted rating (1.51 performance, plus 0.51 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Manchester City on Dec. 15, 2024\n\n- Score: 2-1\n\n- xG: 2.1-0.9\n\nA decisive victory on the road against the four-time-defending Premier League champs ... only lands you in 10th place on this list.\n\n- 2.25 adjusted rating (2.67 performance, minus 0.42 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. West Ham on Nov. 30, 2024\n\n- Score: 5-2\n\n- xG: 3.5-1.5\n\nThis is the most useful part of this exercise.\n\nDue to a combination of reasons -- tactics, injuries, player-personnel decisions, red cards, Raheem Sterling beginning his professional career at age 16 -- Arsenal just haven't had many matches where they've totally overwhelmed their opponent and eliminated any real chance of getting done in by bad luck.\n\nBut didn't they beat Manchester City, uh, 5-1? Yes, but that was in London, City's rating isn't all that special this season, and that was more due to some really impressive finishing than overwhelming chance creation:\n\nArsenal probably have the highest floor of any team in the world. The challenge going forward, if there even is one, is to find a way to raise that ceiling.\n\n- 2.40 adjusted rating (3.35 performance, minus 0.95 opponent)\n\n- Home vs. Leicester City on Dec. 14, 2024\n\n- Score: 4-0\n\n- xG: 3.8-0.2\n\n7. Bournemouth (team rating: 0.60)\n\n- 2.50 adjusted rating (2.93 performance, minus 0.43 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Wolves on Nov. 30, 2024\n\n- Score: 4-2\n\n- xG: 3.3-0.5\n\nAndoni Iraola's side is the third-rated team in the league by our adjusted goal metric, and while it has had some impressive performances, it's more because it has limited the bad matches. Along with Arsenal and Liverpool, Bournemouth are one of only three teams to not produce a single match with a minus-1.0 rating or worse.\n\n- 2.77 adjusted rating (4.09 performance, minus 1.32 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Southampton on Dec. 4, 2024\n\n- Score: 5-1\n\n- xG: 5.2-1.6\n\n- 2.91 adjusted rating (3.92 performance, minus 1.01 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Ipswich Town on Jan.19, 2025\n\n- Score: 6-0\n\n- xG: 3.0-0.5\n\nplay 2:00 Burley 'shocked' by Man City's lack of fight in Champions League exit Craig Burley slams Manchester City's attitude in a limp second leg performance as Real Madrid advance at the Bernabeu.\n\nBoth City's and Chelsea's best matches might speak to the relative flaws of both teams this season. Neither one has any problem annihilating the worst teams in the league, but once you go higher up the table -- to teams with much more talent and high-level coaching, games you can't just win by virtue of having a better roster -- they have both encountered a bunch of problems.\n\n- 3.32 adjusted rating (3.41 performance, minus 0.09 opponent)\n\n- Home vs. Brighton on Feb. 1, 2025\n\n- Score: 7-0\n\n- xG: 3.3-0.9\n\nI'm not sure there's ever been a single game that has altered my perception of a team more, this deep in a season, than Forest's 7-0 beatdown of Brighton. Up until this point, they'd managed with a bunch of one-goal wins and a lot of good fortune in scoring the first goals in their games. They seemed like the classic not-as-good-as-their-record team, and then it seemed like it was all starting to fall apart with the 5-0 loss against the classic much-better-than-their-record team in Bournemouth.\n\nAnd then, well, it all whiplashed back in the other direction the following weekend with the 7-0 win against Brighton. I still wouldn't bet on Forest to finish in the top five, but if you're in third place 25 games into the season and you've shown that you can beat a not-bad team 7-0? You've got a real shot of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\n- 3.42 adjusted rating (4.74 performance, minus 1.32 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Southampton on Jan. 4, 2025\n\n- Score: 5-0\n\n- xG: 4.4-0.3\n\nPer FBref, Brentford have the second-lowest wage bill in the league. Thomas Frank is magic.\n\n- 3.51 adjusted rating (3.65 performance, minus 0.14 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Manchester United on Sept. 29, 2024\n\n- Score: 3-0\n\n- xG: 4.4-1.0\n\nAll of the discussions over Ange Postecoglu's job security were really missing the forest for the trees. This season, Tottenham produced the second-best single-game performance of any team in the league. And, as you'll soon see, they were also unwilling participants on the other side of the best game of the season.\n\nI'm not sure I can remember another Premier League team capable of putting up some of the best and worst games you'll ever see -- in the same season. I hope Postecoglu manages Tottenham forever.\n\n- 4.42 adjusted rating (4.28 performance, plus 0.14 opponent)\n\n- Away vs. Tottenham on Dec. 22, 2024\n\n- Score: 6-3\n\n- xG: 5.6-1.3\n\nOf the 10 highest-rated games so far this season, four of them were played by Liverpool. They've produced games with a rating of 1.5 or better nine times, while no one else has more than six. And they've produced games with a rating of 1.0 or better 14 times, while no one else has more than nine.\n\nThe 6-3 win over Spurs was also, by far, the biggest xG margin of the season, and, incredibly, it does not include a penalty kick. While Arne Slot has certainly tweaked the way Liverpool play, his team hasn't lost the thing that made Jurgen Klopp's teams so special: the ability to just blow their opponents away.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLionel Messi has no shortage of motivation in 2025. His Inter Miami CF won the Supporters' Shield last season, setting an MLS single-season record for points in the process, before being humbly knocked out of the playoffs in Round 1. This year, his second full campaign in the league, marks an opportunity for redemption. It's also the final season of his contract in South Florida.\n\nCould the GOAT put pen to paper on a new deal that would run through next season and beyond the 2026 World Cup? Absolutely. In fact, the Herons expect him to do just that. But as ever in life, there are no guarantees.\n\nSo watch him while you can, savor every moment of Messi magic during his Stateside sojourn, because you never know. This could be the end.\n\nWhile the Argentina captain is in MLS, ESPN is breaking down his performances for Miami game by game, providing stats and info every time he slips on a Herons jersey.\n\nMessi's 2025 tally:\n\nGames played: 2\n\nGoals: 1\n\nAssists: 2\n\nplay 1:08 Messi assists on late equalizing goal in stoppage time Telasco Segovia equalizes the score at 2-2 in late stoppage time to give Inter Miami a point in the season opener.\n\nIt might not have been the result Miami wanted to open the MLS season, but Messi started right where he left off last campaign; laying on two assists for his teammates in Saturday's 2-2 draw.\n\nThe first came from a well-worked routine that ended with Messi squaring the ball for Tom\u00e1s Avil\u00e9s to tap-in in the fifth minute. The second was even better, pushing a perfectly weighted through-ball past the NYCFC defence and into the path of Telasco Segovia, who chipped the ball over an onrushing Matthew Freese and into the net -- levelling the scores and salvaging a point for the hosts a full 10 minutes into stoppage-time.\n\nMessi's 2025 campaign kicked off in the Concacaf Champions Cup in Kansas City on Wednesday night in truly frigid conditions, with temperatures dipping down to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. From mittens to leggings to snoods, exposed skin was a rare sight on the Children's Mercy Park pitch.\n\nThe former Barcelona legend nearly got onto the score sheet in the eighth minute with a clever pass for Luis Su\u00e1rez, whose awkward attempt scuffed wide of the far post. Considering the Uruguay international's clinical finishing, it was a surprise that the ball didn't end up in the back of the net.\n\nKeeping Messi off the board proved a task too tall for Sporting, though. In the 56th minute, the Herons' No. 10 chested down a lofted ball from Sergio Busquets, took two touches and tucked a precise shot just inside the far post to give Miami a 1-0 lead.\n\nMESSI WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS TOUCH AND WEAK FOOT FINISH TO PUT INTER MIAMI AHEAD IN THE FIRST LEG \ud83d\ude33\n\n\n\n(via @FOXSoccer)pic.twitter.com/W034QaF49C \u2014 ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) February 20, 2025\n\nThat's all Inter would need, though, as they took a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their Round 1 tie, claiming a crucial away goal in the process.",

                "text": "We're nearly at the end of 2020, which means it's time for ESPN's annual ranking of the best men's players and coaches in world soccer! Welcome to the FC 100.\n\nThis year, our fifth edition of the countdown has a lot of surprises and new faces -- more on that later -- as well as two teams rising above the rest to dominate the list. As always, our list is broken down into 10 Top 10s for every position on the pitch as well as managers, making for the most meaningful and deep look at the talent across the men's game from goalkeeper to striker.\n\nJump to: Goalkeepers | Right-back | Centre-back | Left-back | Central midfield | Attacking midfield | Wing | Forward | Striker | Manager\n\nRead the FC 100 in: Spanish | Portuguese\n\nPrevious editions of the FC 100: 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016\n\nThe top spots were dominated by two clubs: Bayern Munich, winners of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League, and Liverpool, winners of their first league title in 30 years. They claimed every No. 1 spot except for two, ATTACKING MIDFIELD and FORWARD -- see if you can guess who took those prizes? -- as our voters leaned into their on-field domination.\n\nA couple of other themes emerged in this year's ranking, too:\n\n-- New names, new faces\n\nThis was arguably the most diverse and most refreshed FC 100 since we began in 2016. Nearly half the list -- 47 out of 100 -- were either new to the FC 100 or not ranked in 2019, which reflects not only the challenges of the 2019-20 season amid the coronavirus pandemic but also the turnover of top players and the generational \"passing of the guard\" to a younger group of superstars. Erling Haaland (Borussia Dortmund), Achraf Hakimi (Inter Milan) and Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) all pop up after transcendent seasons, as do Leon Goretzka (Bayern), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa) and Houssem Aouar (Lyon).\n\nThis kind of refreshment is exactly what we're seeing in the game as aging legends fade and new stars are made.\n\n-- Americans are back?\n\nIt might not seem like much, but after being shut out in 2019 for many reasons, the USMNT gets two into the 100 this time around: Christian Pulisic returns -- after a stellar 2020 until injuries hit -- and Sergino Dest, a newcomer to the U.S. scene since choosing to rep the Yanks late last year. Dest cracked the Top 10 at right-back after a superb campaign with Ajax, a summer transfer saga with Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and an eventual move to the Spanish giants, where he became the first U.S. player to start in a Clasico, as well as the first American to score a goal for the storied club.\n\nBut enough preamble; here's how we did the list.\n\nTo compile the 2020 edition of the FC 100, 65 ESPN FC experts (from editors to writers, TV talent to former players) from around the world were given a list of about 250 players and managers to make their selections.\n\nHere's the key: We didn't use one megalist with all players mixed together -- such conceits inevitably favor attackers, because everyone loves a good goal, don't they? But that isn't fair to those engaged in the dark arts at the back. So instead, we broke down the world's best players by position in a 4-3-3 formation, plus manager. Each expert then contributed a Top 10 for each category, and we crunched the numbers and did a final review with a select few writers.\n\nAgree with our picks? Disagree? Now comes the fun part. FC 100: It. Is. On.\n\nNOTE: All player ages are as of Nov. 20\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe modern goalkeeper isn't just there to stop shots. He's also the first step in building attacks; whether with a long, accurate throw or a raking crossfield pass, it's the first major evolution for the position since the \"sweeper-keeper\" became a thing thanks to Manuel Neuer. Agility and reflexes are a given, but confidence, vision and assertive play are vital, too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Elaine Teng\n\nClub/country: Man United/Spain\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nDe Gea has been a constant through United's many ups and downs since he joined the club in 2011. He has faced a lot of criticism over the past nine years -- some fans think he should be dropped for 23-year-old Dean Henderson -- but De Gea is tied for the most Premier League clean sheets in United's history (112, shared with Peter Schmeichel) and made the second-most PL appearances (411) between the posts. Last season, only Liverpool and Manchester City conceded fewer goals, a huge part of why the Red Devils managed to finish third despite a poor start.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Between February and July, De Gea kept nine clean sheets -- the most in the league -- to help United go from seventh to third (and likely saving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's job at the same time).\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Slovenia\n\nAge: 36\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nLast season, Inter fell one point short of seizing the Serie A crown from Juventus and made it to the Europa League final. Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez got much of the praise, but credit should also go to Handanovic's rock-solid performances between the posts. Inter conceded the fewest goals in the league, and their wily captain kept 13 clean sheets. At 36, his reflexes remain sharp, his presence imposing, and he's super adept at the full-stretch highlight save.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A superb save against Getafe's Nemanja Maksimovic helped Inter through to the Europa League quarterfinal and, ultimately, the final.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/Italy\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nConsider this: Donnarumma made his Serie A debut five years ago, has played over 200 games for Milan and is firmly established as the legendary Gianluigi Buffon's successor for Italy. And he's 21 years old. Despite his club's managerial chaos and financial turmoil, he has been a pillar of calm and consistency, keeping at least 10 clean sheets in each of his five seasons and steadily improving his passing accuracy. The Rossoneri are off to a flying start this term, and the sooner they can tie Donnarumma down -- his contract expires next summer -- the better their chances at long-term success.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the goals in Milan's 2-1 derby win over Inter, but Donnarumma made a key save against Romelu Lukaku in his first game back after testing positive for the coronavirus to cement their victory.\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Costa Rica\n\nAge: 33\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas doesn't get as much attention as many of his colleagues on this list, but that doesn't make him less deserving. At Real Madrid, his teammates used to call him \"Keylor Paras\" (\"Keylor Stops\"), and he's lived up to that name after moving to Paris. In his first season at PSG, he kept five clean sheets -- trailing Bayern's Manuel Neuer by just one despite playing 191 fewer minutes -- to guide his team to the Champions League final. In terms of European success, few can usurp him: He has played in four of the past five Champions League finals -- and won three of them.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Making save after save against Atalanta in the Champions League quarterfinal to keep PSG's hopes alive before Neymar & Co. orchestrated a dramatic late comeback.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nAt his best, Ederson can feel like an extra outfield player who also happens to be fantastic at stopping shots. The perfect keeper for Pep Guardiola's brand of possession-based football, his scarily accurate long balls start many a City attack. City have struggled with injuries and have been uncharacteristically fragile at the back, but last season Ederson still managed to keep 16 clean sheets, earning him the Premier League Golden Glove. As they look to wrest the league title back from Liverpool, City will need him at his best on both offense and defense.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Raheem Sterling scored the winner against Arsenal in October, but Ederson made spectacular saves to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka to get City back on track.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nReal Madrid didn't always look as though they would win the league last season, but Courtois was a giant in goal. He conceded 20 goals in 34 league matches, kept 18 clean sheets and boasted the highest save percentage in La Liga. But he has been known for making some outrageous gaffes now and again. In November, during a Nations League match against Denmark, the Belgian No. 1 let a back pass roll straight past him into goal. If Belgium, the top-ranked team in the world, are to win the Euros next year, Courtois will need all of his focus.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his first La Liga title with Real Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Germany\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nIn September 2019, Ter Stegen rushed out of the penalty area, beat a Getafe attacker to the ball and played a long pass into the opposite box for Luis Suarez to calmly lob into the goal. That assist was classic Ter Stegen, a confident sweeper-keeper who's comfortable with the ball at his feet and can convert saves into counterattacks in a flash. The German doesn't get as much attention in a team full of attacking superstars, but he plays a pivotal role in Ronald Koeman's plans as he looks to take Barcelona back to the top of La Liga.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Claiming his second career assist in December 2019, when Antoine Griezmann ran onto his goal kick to score against Mallorca.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/Slovenia\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nIn the six seasons Oblak has tended the Atletico goal, they've conceded fewer than 30 goals each campaign. The efficient, reserved Slovenian is the perfect keeper for Diego Simeone's hardworking, disciplined side. He made nine saves -- more than any keeper in the tournament -- in a man-of-the-match performance away at Liverpool in last season's Champions League to send Atletico through to the quarterfinals. There are more glamorous players in football, but few are as consistent or as effective.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool had 72% possession and 34 shots at the Wanda Metropolitano in March, but they couldn't get past Oblak.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe consummate modern goalkeeper, Alisson can turn defense into offense in the blink of an eye. Equally calm on the ball with his hands and his feet, he was instrumental in Liverpool's charge to their first Premier League trophy in three decades. In January, he even notched an assist when he played a long upfield pass to Mohamed Salah, who made it 2-0 against Manchester United. (Alisson was so delighted he sprinted the length of the pitch, past all of his teammates, to celebrate with the Egypt international.) Liverpool's long injury list this season, especially in central defense, means Alisson is more crucial to their hopes of retaining the title than ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helping Liverpool end their 30-year wait for a Premier League title.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Neuer and Alisson finished tied on overall points after the tallying of ballots, but Neuer was awarded first place by virtue of receiving more first-place votes from the FC voters, with 19 to Alisson's 18.\n\nGermany's sweeper-keeper looked to be slowing down as he reached his mid-30s, but in the past 12 months, the 34-year-old has been back at his imperious best. Seven years since he most recently won a treble with Bayern, Neuer lifted the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League trophies in 2020 as club captain. He made a string of crucial stops in the Champions League final to deny PSG, including a spectacular double save against Neymar. In October, he kept his 200th clean sheet for Bayern, a club record. At times it seems attackers are intimidated just knowing he's in goal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his second Champions League title, though an eighth consecutive Bundesliga trophy is no small feat, either.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nRIGHT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nAt one point, right-backs were considered the least skilled players on the pitch, but the next generation brings boldness and unpredictability. Positional awareness, pinpoint crossing and breakneck pace separate the best from the rest.\n\nPlayer capsules by Stephan Uersfeld\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/United States\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nIt's been an incredible year for the young defender. After just one season and 23 appearances for Ajax's first team since debuting in July 2019, Dest has been on a dizzying upward trajectory, becoming the first American to sign for La Liga giants Barcelona after being involved in a transfer saga that also included Champions League winners Bayern Munich. Not the worst options! The Dutch-born player, capable of playing either full-back position, is considered one of the best young U.S. internationals since committing in October 2019, and he has already shown in four appearances for Barca that he can solve their issues at right-back.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Starting the Clasico, becoming the first American to feature in Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, and even winning Barca's man-of-the-match award in the 3-1 defeat.\n\nClub/country: Atletico Madrid/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nNow in his second La Liga season with Atleti, Trippier has fully embraced his new life away from Tottenham and the Premier League. He's an integral part of Diego Simeone's first XI and has started and finished every match of the 2020-21 season. Playing at right-back at the club level, he's versatile enough to play a more advanced role for England, featuring as a wing-back in Gareth Southgate's 3-4-2-1 formation. Though England have a lot of competition for full-back spots, Trippier's experience, work rate and pinpoint accuracy with crosses could be crucial in the Three Lions' bid to compete at the Euros in the summer.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Trippier's best moment came in a \"return\" to England. In one of the last big matches played in front of fans before the coronavirus shut down the sport, Trippier was instrumental in Atletico's 3-2 win at Liverpool back in March, ably shutting Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson down before coming off in extra time.\n\nClub/country: Leicester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe dynamic defender started all but one of Leicester's 29 Premier League matches before the pandemic, but we're still waiting to see him back in action. His absence due to an ACL injury has been a major challenge for the Foxes, who have missed Pereira's pace and poise on the flank. Before that, Pereira had been involved in 471 duels, more than any other defender across the top five leagues in Europe. Without Pereira, Leicester dropped out of the Champions League spots at the end of the 2019-20 season, proof of his importance to Brendan Rodgers' plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's rare for defenders to show up on the scoresheet, but Pereira put together a superb game against West Ham in January, notching a goal and an assist in a 4-1 win.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Netherlands\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThriving in his role at wing-back for Atalanta, Hateboer was an integral part of one of Europe's most exciting teams last term as the unheralded Italian side came within a late PSG goal of reaching the Champions League semifinals. A force in aerial duels and his side's intricate passing game, he pairs a superhuman work rate with positional intelligence in a demanding position. The 26-year-old was snapped up by Atalanta from Dutch side Groningen for less than a million euros in 2017 and has since become a fixture in the Dutch national team. There's every chance he'll take another step up next summer and move to one of the European giants.\n\nHigh point of 2020: An impressive two-goal performance in the Champions League round of 16, first leg, against Valencia. Not only was it his only game with goals in 2019-20 but it put the tiny Serie A side into the Champions League's last eight in Lisbon.\n\nplay 0:57 Is FC 100 winner Mane the smartest player at Liverpool? Gab Marcotti believes Sadio Mane \"smartness\" is one of the reasons he tops ESPN's FC 100.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Spain\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNavas didn't hold back his tears when Sevilla won the 2019-20 Europa League in Germany this summer. Having begun his senior career at the club in 2003, winning two UEFA Cups and two Copa del Reys, clinching the Europa League at age 34 was seen as just reward for the Spain international. Indeed, he seemingly has gotten better with age since leaving Manchester City for his boyhood club in 2017.\n\nHigh point of 2020: As team captain, Navas contributed an assist against Inter Milan in the final as Sevilla won the competition for the sixth time since 2005.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nA reliable defender under Pep Guardiola, Walker might not have the attacking power of Trent Alexander-Arnold or Achraf Hakimi, for example, but he's been one of the steadier City performers since joining the club in 2017. On the pitch, he patrols City's right side with high tempo, physicality and an unrivalled intensity. In his 30s and with an apparent leadership void in the City squad since Vincent Kompany's exit, Walker has been a vital lieutenant for Guardiola.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner -- but not celebrating it! -- against one of his former clubs, Sheffield United, in his 100th Premier League appearance for Manchester City.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nIt's hard to find anyone more consistent at right-back over the past couple of years. He has fended off the threat of losing his place in Madrid's first XI with another outstanding season, looking so good that his presumed replacement, Achraf Hakimi, returned from a loan at Borussia Dortmund only to be sold to Inter Milan. Carvajal isn't a flashy right-back, known more for his work behind the ball, but he's also been a superb support to Karim Benzema whenever he's able to get forward and play crosses into the box. Carvajal was a part of the Real side that won La Liga for the first time since 2016-17, and despite his missing the start of the campaign through injury, his imminent return will boost Zinedine Zidane's squad immensely.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was superb in both Clasico clashes last season, results that played a key role in Real Madrid's title challenge.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPavard is still far from being a household name, though the young defender was arguably Bayern Munich's unsung hero of a Treble-winning season. Having joined from relegated VfB Stuttgart in 2019, he provided the stability at right-back that allowed Joshua Kimmich to move into a permanent defensive midfield role. Less attacking than some of his Bundesliga right-back peers like Hakimi, he still scored four goals and set up seven in all competitions in his debut season at the Allianz Arena. The \u20ac35 million transfer fee for the France defender looks to be a bargain even though his unspectacular style of play gets him few plaudits. Oh, and Pavard is also capable of putting in a shift at centre-back to further enhance Bayern's myriad options.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In his first league match under Hansi Flick, Pavard was superb, notching an assist as Bayern demolished Borussia Dortmund 4-0 midway through last season.\n\nClub/country: Inter Milan/Morocco\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nA spectacular, adventurous two-way player capable of brilliance on either side of the ball, Hakimi has fast become one of the best right-backs in world soccer. After scoring six goals and providing six assists for Dortmund last season and forming a superb relationship with England star Jadon Sancho while on loan in the Bundesliga, Hakimi joined Inter Milan this summer and has continued to entertain on the wing. One of the fastest defenders in the game, his sloppy passes have caused headaches for teammates at times, though he is always quick to make up for mistakes with attacking contributions.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Down 2-0 at half-time, Hakimi's brace in the Champions League group-stage match against Inter Milan turned around the tie for Dortmund (they went on to win 3-2).\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThe kid from Liverpool is living the dream at Anfield. Liverpool followed up their remarkable Champions League win in 2018-19 with their first league title in 30 years, and Alexander-Arnold once again was vital to the Reds' success. The young defender, who was originally a midfielder in the Liverpool academy, continues to define, and redefine, what full-back play can be in the modern game. His set pieces are a constant threat, and his crosses cause havoc in the penalty area. The England international remains on the way up, but a muscle injury has curtailed his progress this season. That said, the future looks bright for a player who has won 77 of 101 Premier League appearances for his boyhood club.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notching two assists for Virgil van Dijk in the 2-1 win against Brighton in late November, both from set pieces. It was one of the key wins for Liverpool en route to their first-ever Premier League title.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRE-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nBeing a great central defender requires more than size, assertiveness and strength. Some of the modern greats are cultured in possession; others are the epitome of no-nonsense force. The best central defenders combine timing and power with elegance and poise under pressure.\n\nPlayer capsules by Tom Hamilton\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Brazil\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nThe PSG defender was at the forefront of the Ligue 1 champions' journey to the Champions League final in 2019-20. His versatility means PSG boss Thomas Tuchel sometimes uses him in the heart of their midfield, but that has been a bone of contention, with sporting director Leonardo keen to see Marquinhos at centre-back. Wherever he plays, the Brazilian is influential. He's seen as the long-term successor for Thiago Silva, who left for Chelsea in the summer, and is not afraid to speak his mind when asked for his opinion. This made him the perfect candidate to be PSG's new captain, with the club's former defender Jean-Marc Pilorget describing Marquinhos as \"unflappable on the field.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Superb in PSG's Champions League campaign, scoring two key goals against Atalanta and RB Leipzig to help the side into the final.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nRated as one of the world's best young centre-backs, Kounde's brilliant season led to a \"magnificent\" transfer offer from Manchester City, according to Monchi, the club's sporting director. Monchi later praised Kounde's response to the rejected bid, saying he displayed \"professional and respectful behaviour.\" City eventually went for Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias, but Manchester United are also interested in the man who now has his sights on supplanting Raphael Varane and Dayot Upamecano with the France national team. Having moved to Sevilla from Bordeaux for \u00a322.5m ahead of the 2019-20 season, he's since helped them to the Europa League title last season and is an important figure in their Champions League aspirations this term.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Had plenty of eye-catching performances last season, but was singularly magnificent in their quarterfinal win over Wolves in the Europa League.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Netherland\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nThe Dutch centre-back completed his big-money, \u20ac75 million move to Juventus ahead of the 2019-20 campaign and, in doing so, followed in the footsteps of his idols, Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. Initially, then-coach Maurizio Sarri planned to integrate him slowly, but Giorgio Chiellini's long-term injury saw the young defender thrust into the first team. He made a shaky start, but despite battling a shoulder injury in 2020-21, he's become an integral part of the Juventus defence. Juve's 2-0 win at Bologna in June was the match in which De Ligt really announced himself in Serie A. \"He was only born in 1999, and he has been catapulted into a new way of playing. He's smart,\" Chiellini said of De Ligt. The CIES Football Observatory ranks De Ligt as the most valuable central defender in the world, putting his current value at an eye-watering \u20ac105m.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Neatly summed up in his performance against Lyon in the final 16 of the Champions League when he battled on despite having his head cut open early in the match.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/France\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nLaporte's importance at Manchester City is perhaps best illustrated by his absence. There's a popular school of thought that if Laporte hadn't suffered a knee injury that ruled him out for four months, the Premier League title race would have been far closer last season. \"We have missed him a lot; he's the best left central defender in the world,\" City boss Pep Guardiola said of Laporte. \"Imagine the best teams in the world lose their best central defender. He is fast, strong in the air.\" Laporte is one half of a formidable partnership at the back for City alongside new signing Ruben Dias, and they will form the foundations for another push for trophies. Laporte is still waiting to make his debut for the French national team, such are Didier Deschamps' embarrassment of riches for France, but it's a matter of when, not if.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Simply seeing him back in action after a long layoff. Laporte is so important to City that Guardiola had to warn against his return back in January being seen as the single answer to solving all of their defensive worries.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nYet another French international on the list, Varane is one-half of Real Madrid's formidable partnership alongside Sergio Ramos, though the 27-year-old has endured a mixed 2020. He was indispensable in Real's watertight rear guard en route to the league title, with Los Blancos conceding just six in 11 games after the restart, and Varane's friends and teammates, like France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, aren't concerned. \"He is a great champion above all else,\" Lloris said. \"He has great experience. He is a leader in our team.\" And his Real Madrid teammate Eden Hazard has also been impressed: \"I've come across some fantastic defenders during my career, such as John Terry and Vincent Kompany. I think that although [Varane] is still young, he's already one of the best centre-backs of all time.\" Despite questions over his form -- he still ranks fourth in Europe's big five leagues for aerial defensive duels won this season -- he always fronts up, takes responsibility and seeks improvement.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 32 league games as Real clinched their first La Liga crown since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: RB Leipzig/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe young Frenchman has been linked with just about every European giant after another strong season, with Manchester United and Bayern Munich reportedly at the front of the queue. \"As for the future, I'm not sure [if Upamecano will stay] as he is very talented,\" Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann told ESPN. \"Lots of clubs will want to buy him -- perhaps next season, it could be real that he leaves the club.\" Even though he's just 22, Upamecano plays with authority at the back, unafraid to carry the ball out of defence but also positionally aware to know when to take a safer option. Alongside Kounde, Kurt Zouma and Aymeric Laporte, he's one of a number of brilliant defenders at France boss Didier Deschamps' disposal.\n\nHigh point of 2020: In a season when RB Leipzig got to the semifinals of the Champions League, he was at his commanding best in their quarterfinal win against Atletico Madrid.\n\nClub/country: Napoli/Senegal\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThere's not a transfer window that goes by without a handful of the European giants being linked with the Napoli defender. The latest team to chase the 6-foot-5 Senegal international was PSG in the summer, but Napoli were resolute in rejecting any offers that fell short of their \u20ac75m asking price. \"I had no doubts, he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role,\" Napoli boss Gennaro Gattuso said in September of Koulibaly. He's now his national team's captain and was rated by ex-Spain goalkeeper Pepe Reina as the best centre-back he's played behind. The future remains uncertain for Koulibaly with a number of teams forever linked with him -- Liverpool could go back in for him amid their defensive injury crisis -- but for now, he is indispensable to Napoli.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Though Napoli finished second to Juventus again in the league, Koulibaly was superb in the Coppa Italia final as his side bested the league champions on penalties.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Austria\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 2 (left-back)\n\nWhat can you say about one of the most versatile defenders in the modern game? Alaba started last season at left-back under previous coach Niko Kovac, only to finish it as a triple-winning centre-back. The Austrian player's contract is up at the end of the season, and Bayern Munich are bracing for his exit -- expect the likes of Liverpool to be interested. Bayern manager Hansi Flick says Alaba \"holds the defence together,\" while Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in August likened Alaba's impact at centre back to the transformational qualities of Franz Beckenbauer. \"We haven't had a 'chief' in defence for some time now, one who really takes the reins in hand and sets the tone there and simply acts as the head of the defensive unit -- he did that,\" Rummenigge said.\n\nHigh point of 2020: There were numerous standout moments for Alaba, but the past 12 months will be remembered as the time Bayern Munich swept all before them, winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Spain\n\nAge: 34\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nThe Real Madrid talisman continues to be a polarising figure, but love him or hate him, he is a truly remarkable player. His Real teammate Toni Kroos calls him the \"absolute captain\" and the \"best you can have.\" Despite his age, Ramos would still walk into most sides and will be a top free agent if he opts against extending his stay at Real Madrid after this season. In the meantime, he continues to set records, having passed the 100-goal mark for Los Blancos and also set a record with his 45th El Clasico appearance when Real Madrid beat Barcelona 3-1 in late October. Ramos is still indispensable for Spain at the international level, too, with Luis Enrique calling him a \"unique, different level\" defender, and he recently set a record there as well, with his 177th Spain cap against Germany, the most appearances at international level for anyone in the men's game in Europe.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Los Blancos supporters will remember his key penalties in Real's back-to-back 1-0 wins over Getafe and Athletic Bilbao in July, as they continued their charge to the 2019-20 La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Netherlands\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nIt's testament to Van Dijk that when he suffered his season-ending injury against Everton in October, the mood around Liverpool changed. Gigi Wijnaldum said that the squad had suffered \"sleepless nights,\" while Jurgen Klopp admits Van Dijk is irreplaceable. \"Every team in the world would miss Virgil van Dijk,\" Klopp said soon after his injury. \"He is the best in the world.\" Up to that injury, the Dutch international had missed just one Premier League game for Liverpool after signing from Southampton for \u00a375m in January 2018.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing every single minute (and scoring five goals) in Liverpool's 2019-20 Premier League-winning season, the club's first league title in 30 years. Need we say more?\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nLEFT-BACK\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nTop left-backs are as comfortable locking down an opposing winger as they are turning into one when their teams are in possession. Some aren't even left-footed, using their positional awareness to drift infield and be another central defender or midfielder if needed.\n\nIn the modern era, no positions touch the ball more than full-back, making the best of them simply indispensable.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/France\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 7\n\nMendy established himself as Real Madrid's undisputed first-choice left-back this year after coach Zinedine Zidane requested his signing in the summer of 2019. In the biggest games, against Barcelona in La Liga or Manchester City in the Champions League, Mendy -- not Marcelo -- gets the nod. Mendy might lack his teammate's eye-catching skills, but he offers a defensive solidity that helped the team keep clean sheet after clean sheet post-lockdown. He's no slouch going forward, either.\n\nHigh point of 2020: His only goal for the club so far, a thunderous near-post finish against Granada as Real Madrid closed in on the La Liga title.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nMarcelo's reputation and history -- and Real Madrid's title win -- see him make this list even though, by his own standards, he had a disappointing year. The 32-year-old started fewer than half of Real Madrid's games in 2019-20, and the defensive lapses that have made him an occasional liability during a hugely successful club career became increasingly common. Since Zinedine Zidane returned for his second spell in charge, in 2019, Madrid have lost nine league games, and Marcelo started all of them. No one doubts his talent and personality, though, and on his day, there are few footballers who are more fun to watch.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning his fifth league title in 14 years as a Real Madrid player.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/England\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nChilwell was an important part of Leicester City's impressive 2019-20 campaign, and his August move to Chelsea -- after a drawn-out transfer saga that saw Leicester demand a world-record fee for a defender before accepting \"only\" \u00a350m -- cemented his status as one of English football's best young players. Wasting no time at Stamford Bridge, Chilwell provided a goal and assist on his Premier League debut. Coach Frank Lampard says he's \"fantastic,\" praising Chilwell's \"ability to be so high up the pitch when you want him.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: A glorious 90th-minute goal vs. Watford in Leicester's first game back in June, which was somewhat spoiled by Watford equalising three minutes later.\n\nClub/country: AC Milan/France\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThis has been a year of rediscovery for the young Frenchman as he finally started to resemble the powerful, expansive full-back it was hoped he'd become when he graduated from the Atletico Madrid academy alongside his older brother, Lucas. Hernandez excelled on loan at Alaves in 2016-17, looked out of his depth at Real Madrid in 2017-18 and was decidedly average at Real Sociedad in 2018-19. At Milan, though, he's been a revelation. Hernandez scored six goals in Serie A last season, with Opta rating him as the best left-back in Italy.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A crisp, volleyed finish in a 3-2 win over Udinese in January.\n\nClub/country: Tottenham/Spain\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nArguably the best full-back in La Liga last season, Reguilon was a blur of constant movement on the left flank of Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla team as they cruised to a top-four league finish and won the Europa League. But, remarkably, Real Madrid chose to cash in, selling him to Tottenham off the back of that impressive loan. It's true that Real have a buyback clause, but why wait for a season or two? Reguilon is good enough to be starting for Real Madrid right now. In the meantime, he's become an integral part of Jose Mourinho's Spurs side, one that has a very real shot at winning the Premier League.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Winning the Europa League in his last game for Sevilla.\n\nClub/country: Borussia Dortmund/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGuerreiro doesn't attract the headlines of others on this list -- or of some high-profile teammates at Dortmund -- but he quietly had the best season of his career in 2019-20. Coach Lucien Favre's tactical switch to a 3-4-3 formation helped enormously, enabling Guerreiro to operate in the wing-back role to which he is best suited while minimising the defects that hold him back as a pure full-back or winger. A well-rounded player, he contributed an impressive eight goals to Dortmund's second-placed Bundesliga finish. At 26, he's approaching his peak, and chose to sign a new deal in October 2019 despite reported interest from Barcelona and PSG.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring twice in Dortmund's 4-0 derby win over Schalke in May.\n\nClub/country: Juventus/Brazil\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 4\n\nTaking fourth place in our list for the fourth year in a row suggests Sandro is consistency personified. Into his sixth season at Juventus and soon to turn 30, he remains one of the most reliable performers in world football in his position. (Juventus were so excited about signing him in 2015 that they published a glowing story on the team website about his myriad qualities.) Sandro isn't quite as dangerous going forward as you might expect, though there aren't any real weaknesses to his game. Brazilian great Roberto Carlos said in 2015 that Sandro was his true \"successor,\" and few can argue with his assessment.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored Juventus' third goal in a 3-3 roller-coaster draw with Sassuolo, then cleared a potential winner off the line.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Spain\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nAlba is past his peak and looks to have been left behind by Spain at the international level, but he's still Barcelona's undisputed first-choice left-back. His link-ups with Lionel Messi -- once one of the most fruitful attacking partnerships in football -- remain dangerous, albeit less frequent. Alba has set up three goals this season under new coach Ronald Koeman. His defensive failings are well known, and unlikely to change at this stage. Barcelona have tried to prepare for life after Alba -- the Spain international will be 32 in March -- but Lucas Digne and Junior Firpo have already failed to supplant him at the Camp Nou.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Whatever it was, it wasn't Barca's 8-2 defeat to Bayern.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Canada\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nDavies' emergence as a world-class player has been thrilling to watch. Take his assist in Bayern's 8-2 Champions League demolition of Barcelona, when he evaded Lionel Messi, left Arturo Vidal on the floor and flummoxed Nelson Semedo before cutting the ball back for Joshua Kimmich to tap in. Was there a more memorable setup in 2020? \"I was almost ashamed of how happy I was after scoring, because it was 99% his goal,\" Kimmich said afterward, and it was hard to disagree.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That assist, obviously, though winning a domestic/European Treble with Bayern was also extremely special.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Scotland\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nThis year's title win, ending Liverpool's 30-year wait, was the culmination of a remarkable journey for Robertson. In three years at Anfield, he's gone from Premier League prospect to, quite simply, the best left-back in the world. It almost seems wrong to call him \"left-back\" given how prolific he is in attack, racking up 23 assists in the past two Premier League seasons from a defensive position. In terms of creating chances, taking set pieces and working tirelessly off the ball, he is a cut above. He racked up his 100th Premier League appearance for the club, and the \u00a310m that Liverpool spent on Robertson in 2017 from Hull City increasingly looks like one of the best bits of transfer business ever.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Liverpool won the league. You might have heard about it.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nCENTRAL MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe key to playing central midfield is a good sense of rhythm: knowing when to speed up in transition and when to slow the pace. There are many forms, too: the tough tackler, box-to-box machine and the nimble playmaker. It's about seeing the whole field -- and exploiting it.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Paris Saint-Germain/Italy\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 9\n\nIt has been a stop-start year for most players amid the coronavirus pandemic, but especially for Verratti. The French league decided to curtail the 2019-20 season in March, and when PSG eventually returned to competitive action in the French Cup final and Champions League in the summer, Verratti was injured. He reappeared as a substitute in the CL semifinal win over RB Leipzig before featuring for 25 minutes in the final against Bayern. However, while staying fit remains a problem, his absences from Thomas Tuchel's side serve only to highlight his importance. PSG are a different side with pass-master Verratti in their midfield, and he's also playing a big role in the rejuvenation of the Italian national team under Roberto Mancini.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Completing a domestic Treble with PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Croatia\n\nAge: 35\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nModric might be in the twilight of his playing career, but he's still getting it done in one of the most demanding midfields and for one of the most demanding fan bases. The Croatian midfielder's ability on the ball and his vision of the game have always been his strong suit. It's how he casually guided Croatia to the World Cup final in 2018 and picked up the Ballon d'Or -- the first player not named Messi or Ronaldo to win it since 2007 -- in the same year. That's why Zinedine Zidane still trusts him to deliver at the highest level.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scored his first-ever El Clasico goal last season as Real surged to the title at their rivals' expense.\n\nClub/country: Barcelona/Netherlands\n\nAge: 23\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nThe Dutch midfielder was the poster boy of European football when he joined Barca from Ajax for \u20ac70 million in 2019, but his first season in Spain showed him that not everything is always rosy in football. After excelling as the deepest midfielder at Ajax, he is playing a more attacking role under first Ernesto Valverde and later Quique Setien in Spain. Despite being moved around and having to adapt to a new country and a new language, De Jong showed glimpses of his talent, and there are signs of improvement in his second season at the club. Under his third coach at Camp Nou -- his compatriot Ronald Koeman -- he looks more comfortable in a \"double pivot\" (a pair of deep-lying midfielders who shield the defense and share creative responsibilities), and Barca hope he can rule their midfield for the next decade.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Has played every minute for Barcelona in La Liga this season.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Brazil\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nThe Brazilian won the Champions League in his first season with Liverpool and the Premier League title in his second. Not bad, right? He has excelled for Jurgen Klopp's side at the base of the midfield as an imposing figure who also offers a touch of class on the ball. He was incredible in the 3-1 win over Manchester City in November 2019, opening the scoring. His versatility is increasingly important, too. He played as a full-back earlier in his career at Real Madrid and AS Monaco, but is just as comfortable slotting into central defense for the Reds after a serious injury to Virgil van Dijk.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played 28 games in Liverpool's first-ever Premier League title win.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/England\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere are more glamorous players at Liverpool, but England international Henderson took the plaudits for his side's Premier League triumph last season. For his performances on the pitch, his influence as the club's captain and his work with the #playerstogether initiative during the coronavirus lockdown, he's finally getting the respect his career has demanded. Henderson is not a highlight-reel player at the base of the Reds' midfield, but his hard work, unfussy style of play and passionate captaincy remain essential to the Reds' success. He's never been a player who captures the imagination at Liverpool -- or anywhere, for that matter -- but there's a reason his is the first name Jurgen Klopp puts on the team sheet.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A Premier League title, anyone?\n\nplay 1:00 Laurens: Mbappe will dominate for the next 10 years Julien Laurens believes Kylian Mbappe will be the next generational player once Messi and Ronaldo retire.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/France\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nEden Hazard once said that Kante is so good that he plays like two men in midfield, and who can argue? Understated and always willing to let more talented teammates get the glory, Kante is the perfect pivot for club and country. Though injuries and a positional change under then-Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri reduced his effectiveness, there are signs under Frank Lampard that he is refinding his best form. Back at the base of the midfield and with a stellar attack ahead of him, his relentless work in winning the ball back and distributing it could prove just as important as the goals and assists Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner contribute.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Helped Chelsea to finish runner-up in the FA Cup despite missing much of the season through injury and concerns around COVID-19. Also passed 150 appearances for the club despite transfer interest from PSG.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 28\n\n2019 rank: 5\n\nTo classify Casemiro as a \"destroyer\" in midfield is to do the Brazil international a disservice. He offers much more to Madrid than just protection to the back four, and you could even argue he's become their most important player. When he doesn't play, Madrid struggle. He missed three league games last season, and Madrid won only one of them. Madrid conceded four at Valencia in November when he was absent with the coronavirus. He also has developed a knack for scoring important goals: twice in the 2-1 win against Sevilla last season, and the winner in the 1-0 victory at Espanyol as Madrid closed in on the league title. He was also on target against Borussia Monchengladbach in October as Zinedine Zidane's side came from behind to draw 2-2 in the Champions League. The other goal was scored by Karim Benzema, but guess who set it up? Casemiro.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games in the coronavirus-impacted La Liga season en route to the league title, his second since joining the club in 2013.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Germany\n\nAge: 30\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nKroos is into his seventh season with Madrid and remains as important to Zinedine Zidane's side as ever. Take it from ZZ himself, who enjoys simply watching the German midfielder at practice. \"I love to watch Toni train,\" Zidane said. \"I love to be there for his training sessions. They're exceptional sessions. I'm not saying it for the sake of it. It's true. I've never seen him lose the ball. Well, maybe once. His game is always elegant and efficient. He never has a bad day.\" Even Pep Guardiola, who managed Kroos at Bayern Munich, raved about his former charge in a 2020 documentary: \"The players that shout the most are those that hide when things go badly. Toni is the opposite, he's the bravest of them all in the most difficult moments.\" Before last season, Kroos had won La Liga once, but his consistency in Madrid's 10-game winning run -- Casemiro said earlier this year that \"Real Madrid matches always go in Kroos' rhythm\" -- when football resumed in June helped Los Blancos end a three-year wait for the Spanish title.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing 35 games and adding several key assists on the way to Real's La Liga title, their first since 2016-17.\n\nClub/country: Liverpool/Spain\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThiago turned heads this summer when he signed for Liverpool, but it wasn't the transfer that shocked people; rather, it was the fact that other elite teams across Europe didn't put up a fight to sign him instead. Despite a string of challenging injuries throughout his career, Thiago has ability and creative skills that have never diminished. Even last season he missed the run-in in the Bundesliga, although before that he had been influential in Bayern's turnaround under Hansi Flick, and he returned in time for the Champions League knockout phase to exert his authority on the competition. At his best, he's a peerless deep-lying playmaker, perfect for unlocking packed defenses -- something Liverpool face often -- with a clever pass or swivel of the hips. He makes everything look so simple and was the best player on the pitch in the final in Lisbon -- completing 85 passes, more than any other player (Kimmich managed 78) -- as Bayern beat PSG to clinch the Treble.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Finishing his final season at Bayern in style, with a domestic/European Treble and, most notably, his first Champions League winners' medal since he got one with Barcelona in 2010-11.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: 2 (right-back)\n\nKimmich is a coach's dream. Last season, he alternated effortlessly between the right-back and defensive midfield positions. He even filled in at centre-back occasionally, though coach Hansi Flick prefers him in midfield, especially since the sale of Thiago to Liverpool. For old time's sake, it was at right-back, with Benjamin Pavard returning from injury, where he took on the role of chief creator in Bayern's run to Champions League glory in the summer. He scored one and created four of his side's goals in the quarterfinal stage, including assisting the winner in the final for Kingsley Coman. Still just 25, he is Bayern's present and future.\n\nHigh point of 2020: He was instrumental in Bayern's first Champions League win since 2012-13, Jupp Heynckes' final season with the club.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nATTACKING MIDFIELD\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nThe best attacking midfielders have a sense of mischief, capable of cracking a robust defensive set with improvisation or magic. Greats make the most of their free roles to entertain, create and convert.\n\nPlayer capsules by Sam Marsden\n\nClub/country: Aston Villa/England\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nBig things have been expected from Grealish since he made his Premier League debut at 18 for Aston Villa in 2014. However, it's over only the past 12 months that he has really kicked on. He's a more mature, productive player on the pitch and, after helping Villa stay up on the final day of last season, he's started the new season in red-hot form for club and country. A midfielder who excels with the ball at his feet and who knows how to create space, it's not hard to understand why he's been linked to both Manchester United and Manchester City in 2020.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Grealish scored twice and set up three goals in Villa's extraordinary 7-2 win against Liverpool in October.\n\nClub/country: Lyon/France\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThe Lyon side that reached the Champions League semifinal last season was brimming with talent, but the jewel in the Ligue 1 side's crown was undoubtedly Aouar. He tore apart Juventus and Manchester City in an advanced midfield role, setting up four of Lyon's five goals against the two European giants as they set up a final four meeting with eventual winners Bayern. A quick-footed creator with trickery in abundance, Aouar resisted a summer move to the Premier League, though it's just a matter of time until his skills enhance a bigger club and on a bigger stage.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Lyon to within 90 minutes of the Champions League final with a string of match-winning performances.\n\nClub/country: Man United/France\n\nAge: 27\n\n2019 rank: 6\n\nFew players divide opinion quite like Pogba. France teammate Antoine Griezmann told ESPN that Pogba is the \"most underrated player in the world,\" but not everyone would agree. He has arguably flattered to deceive since returning to Manchester United from Juventus for \u20ac100m in 2016 -- together, they've won just one League Cup and a Europa League in four seasons -- but the underlying feeling is that he is still one of the best box-to-box midfielders on his day. He is capable of the sublime, if he can stay fit. Last season was tainted by injuries -- he was restricted to 21 appearances, scoring just one goal -- but with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford and a settled XI under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the conditions are ripe for Pogba to show his best.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Setting up the crucial second goal after coming off the bench in a Champions League group stage win at Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: 1\n\nSilva was not able to live up to his excellent 2018-19 campaign last season, but when on form, he remains one of Europe's most creative midfielders. Even so, he still managed to score six goals and record seven assists as Man City finished second in the Premier League in 2019-20. However, he didn't even make it off the bench as City were stunned by Lyon in the Champions League quarterfinal when the tournament resumed in August. His aim this season is to win his place back in the City XI by rediscovering the form that led coach Pep Guardiola to say: \"Right now, it's Bernardo and 10 more players.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Notched a goal and an assist against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semifinals, putting City on course to win their only trophy of the 2019-20 season.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/Germany\n\nAge: 21\n\n2019 rank: 8\n\nChelsea have lacked a dominant playmaker from midfielder for years, but in signing Havertz, the No. 10 spot is secured for years to come. Havertz is mature beyond his years: as a 20-year-old last season, he steered Bayer Leverkusen to a fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga with 12 goals. He also scored in four out of five Europa League games as Leverkusen reached the final eight, where they lost to eventual runners-up Inter Milan. Many expect him to become one of the best players in the world, and he's already a regular under Frank Lampard at Chelsea, who was \"overwhelmed\" with his new signing's humility and quiet confidence upon arrival in England.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Taking Leverkusen to the final eight of the Europa League was good, but a hat trick in a League Cup win over Barnsley was a nice moment early in his Chelsea career.\n\nplay 1:40 Klopp the FC 100's best boss after 'historic' season Gab Marcotti explains how Jurgen Klopp beat Hansi Flick to the FC 100 best manager award.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 25\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGoretzka's physical transformation since signing for Bayern from Schalke has mirrored the German club's rise back to the top of European football. The once-slender midfielder looks more like a bodybuilder than a soccer star these days, having put on a tremendous amount of muscle. The extra bulk has helped keep him healthy, and Bayern benefit from his resilience: He was integral in Bayern's dominant Treble-winning season, weighing in with eight goals and 11 assists. \"The day I was unveiled at Bayern, I said I'd like to assume a role of responsibility within the team,\" Goretzka said this summer, \"and I'm moving more in that direction now. Maybe also imposing myself a bit more as I've got physically stronger. And that's a development I'm pleased with.\" Aggressive without being reckless and assertive without racking up yellow and red cards, Goretzka is, as former RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick puts it, \"the best box-to-box player in the world.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Played a big role in Bayern's Treble-winning season.\n\nClub/country: Atalanta/Argentina\n\nAge: 32\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nGomez is one of the great Atalanta success stories. Plucked from Metalist Kharkiv for just \u00a34m in 2014, he's now regarded as one of the world's best midfielders. He even got a recall to the Argentina national team at the age of 32, three years after he won his fourth cap. He is arguably the frontman for this band of unfashionable players who have turned into European powerhouses under Gian Piero Gasperini. His record of seven goals and 16 assists in the Italian top flight belies his true influence: He is the conduit for his team's attack (a team that scored the most goals in the Italian top flight last season) and his form saw him named Serie A midfielder of the year.\n\nAs Atalanta captain, Gomez also played an important role in helping heal Bergamo. Atalanta's Lombardy region was hit hard by COVID-19 back in March, recording over 16,000 deaths because of the pandemic. Atalanta became a symbol of hope for that part of Italy, and their charge to the Champions League quarterfinals was as much for the region as it was for the players. During lockdown, Gomez used his social media platform to share \"life hacks\" such as how to repurpose plastic bottles, or offering indoor workout plans.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Returning to the Argentina national team after years without a call-up.\n\nClub/country: Manchester United/Portugal\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nFernandes has been so good since signing for Manchester United for an initial fee of \u20ac55 million that it seems as though he's been there for years. In 14 Premier League appearances last season, he scored eight goals and created seven more, confirming that he could do in England what he'd done in Portugal, where he hit 20 goals in the Primeira Liga in 2018-19. Fernandes has done more of the same at the start of this season, with goals and match-winning performances against Brighton and Everton. He's not even been at Old Trafford for a year, but he's already United's talisman.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Was instrumental in Man United's return to the Champions League and third-place finish in 2019-20.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/Germany\n\nAge: 31\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nNot only has Muller been one of the best players in the world over the past year, with his own unique sense of humour, but he's also one of the most entertaining. Muller was so good in the early 2010s they named a position after him -- the \"Raumdeuter\" (\"interpreter of space\") -- but the past season has been a seesaw of emotions. He started the 2019-20 season exiled under previous Bayern boss Niko Kovac and was contemplating leaving, but when Hansi Flick took charge, he put Muller slap-bang in the middle of his attacking lineup and Muller delivered. He finished the most recent campaign with a record-breaking 21 assists in the Bundesliga and helped Bayern deliver a remarkable Treble -- aided by his two goals in their 8-2 dismantling of Barcelona. His form has led to widespread calls for Joachim Low to bring him back in from the cold for Germany, but Low is still trying his best to ignore them.\n\nMuller has also provided us with a huge amount of enjoyment off the pitch. His social media account is wonderfully personable, and his impression of the Road Runner in describing Alphonso Davies' pace was brilliant. And he has now offered a second word into the football lexicon, with \"Lewan-goal-ski\" now alongside his very own position, even though he's not sure whether the definition fits his style. \"I'm always on the prowl. But I'm also more than just a 'Raumdeuter.' My skills on the ball are also very good. But of course, my great strength is making runs with the right timing.\"\n\nHigh point of 2020: Playing an instrumental role in Bayern's three-trophy season.\n\nClub/country: Manchester City/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 2\n\nManchester City missed out on the title to Liverpool last season by an 18-point margin, but De Bruyne's work did not go unnoticed. In 35 Premier League appearances, he set up 20 goals for his teammates, matching the record for assists in a single season held by Arsenal great Thierry Henry. He also scored 13 goals for Pep Guardiola's side as they ended the season in second place. De Bruyne won't want to come second again, meaning his motor and creativity will be pivotal to City wrestling the title back from Merseyside.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Matching the Premier League's single-season assist record.\n\nClick here to go back to the top\n\nWING\n\nESPN Illustration\n\nWingers still have a role to play in the modern era. Their pace and persistence on the flanks give their teams another angle of attack; their ability to cut infield and shoot adds a dimension too.\n\nPlayer capsules by Alex Kirkland\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Brazil\n\nAge: 20\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nVinicius still feels more like a bundle of raw attributes -- pace, trickery -- than a fully formed player. He frustrates as often as he thrills, a view shared by his own Real Madrid teammates at times, as evidenced by Karim Benzema blasting Vinicius to another player while the Brazilian watched back in October. But when Real Madrid need a goal or a different dimension in attack, they turn to Vinicius. Half the time, even he doesn't look as if he knows what's going to happen next, but maybe that's the point. In a modern game that is so often defined by rigid tactical discipline, his unpredictability can be priceless.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the opening goal against Barcelona in El Clasico in March, a match that saw the title race start to tip in Real Madrid's favour.\n\nClub/country: Real Madrid/Belgium\n\nAge: 29\n\n2019 rank: 3\n\nHazard called 2019-20 \"the worst season of my career\" and it's hard to argue. He was out of shape on his arrival at Real Madrid, and an ankle fracture in November followed by another in February meant Hazard was essentially an irrelevance in their title win. At least the campaign's delayed conclusion allowed him to recover in time to make some unremarkable late appearances. Serious questions have been asked about the wisdom of Madrid investing so much -- reportedly up to \u20ac160m -- in Hazard in 2019, especially when he would have been available for free a year later. No one doubts his world-class talent, though, and we might still see a player who was once the Premier League's best repeat that form in a Real Madrid shirt.\n\nHigh point of 2020: A stunning long-range goal against Huesca in October 2020 suggested that better things could be just around the corner.\n\nClub/country: Sevilla/Argentina\n\nAge: 26\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nSevilla transfer guru Monchi rarely gets a deal wrong, but the bargain \u20ac15m signing of Ocampos from Marseille must rank among his best acquisitions ever. At that point, the Argentinian looked like a solid professional, albeit performing below the potential he'd shown as a youngster at River Plate, with underwhelming spells in Ligue 1 and Serie A. At Sevilla, he has developed into the best winger, and one of the most effective players in any position, in La Liga. His boundless reserves of energy are a perfect fit for Julen Lopetegui's exhausting, all-action brand of football. One game summed up his season: Not only did Ocampos score in Sevilla's 1-0 win over Eibar in July but he also went in goal when keeper Tomas Vaclik got injured, even making a crucial save in the ninth minute of added time.\n\nHigh point of 2020: It's tempting to say the Europa League win, but let's face it: the brilliant madness of stand-in keeper Ocampos saving from actual Eibar keeper Dmitrovic (yes, really) in the 99th minute is hard to beat.\n\nClub/country: Bayern Munich/France\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nThere was a cruel poetry to the manner of Paris Saint-Germain's 2020 Champions League final defeat. Having spent over a billion euros to get within touching distance of the trophy they crave above all others, they were denied by a headed goal from Coman -- one of their own, discarded youth products. Coman joined PSG at the age of 10 and became their youngest-ever debutant at 16 before deciding to continue his career elsewhere. Still improving and into his sixth season at Bayern, he has an experience beyond his years and a trophy cabinet to match.\n\nHigh point of 2020: Scoring the winner in a Champions League final against his former club.\n\nClub/country: Chelsea/United States\n\nAge: 22\n\n2019 rank: Not ranked\n\nPulisic's first season in England might have ended on a sour note, with him looking distraught as he limped off with a hamstring injury in Chelsea's FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal, but that shouldn't obscure what had come before it. Pulisic did enough that day at Wembley -- and in the 2019-20 season as a whole -- to suggest that all the hype around the U.S. star is absolutely justified. Nine Premier League goals from 25 appearances was an impressive return for a wide player, and more than twice as many as he ever scored in a season at Borussia Dortmund, which suggests he's progressing nicely under coach Frank Lampard despite those injury problems.\n\nHigh point of 2020: That fifth-minute FA Cup final goal.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTGL is a new team golf league in which opposing teams go head-to-head in a 15-hole match that is split between a large simulator and a unique green that adjusts to match the exact placement of the ball in the simulator for short shots. The first nine holes are alternate shot while the last six holes are singles.\n\nEach team fields three players for the matches, starting each hole by teeing off on real grass tee boxes into a screen that is 64 feet by 53 feet -- 24 times larger than a standard golf simulator.\n\nFor shots of 130 yards or longer, including most tee shots, golfers will hit from a back box that is 35 yards away from the screen. The back box accommodates shots from real fairway grass and rough, as well as sand. For shots of 50 to 129 yards, golfers will hit from a front box that is located 21 yards from the screen.\n\nThe landing location of their tee shots will determine the next challenge: Approach shots played from natural grass fairways, deep rough or white sand.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTGL action continued on Monday as the league hosted its first doubleheader of the season.\n\nIn the first match, Los Angeles Golf Club took on New York Golf Club. New York picked up its first win of the season over Boston Common Golf last week. Rickie Fowler, Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick were the active players for NYGC. Xander Schauffele did not participate in the match. For L.A., Sahith Theegala, Collin Morikawa and Tony Finau competed, while Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose sat out. Finau, a six-time PGA Tour winner, made his TGL debut after signing a one-match contract for Los Angeles.\n\nDespite a strong start from New York, who took a 4-0 lead to start the match, the team wasn't able to hold off Los Angeles, as L.A. stormed back to earn a 5-4 win in overtime. Los Angeles clinched a playoff spot with the win.\n\nIn the second match, Boston Common went head-to-head with Atlanta Drive Golf Club. Boston was still looking for its first win of the year.\n\nRory McIlroy, Keegan Bradley and Hideki Matsuyama played for Boston, while Adam Scott was inactive. On the other side, Justin Thomas, Billy Horschel and Patrick Cantlay dressed out for Atlanta. Lucas Glover did not compete in the match.\n\nBoston took an early lead over Atlanta through the first 10 holes, but Atlanta pulled off a comeback late in the match to earn a 6-3 victory.

Fowler's putt was the longest of the league's inaugural season, giving him the TGL record.\n\nYoung breaks Fowler's record\n\nFowler's record didn't last very long, as his teammate broke the record just two holes later. Young sank a 38-foot putt on Hole 4.\n\nFinau cuts New York's lead to one point\n\nFinau came up big in his TGL debut. After a slow start for his team, Finau sank a 10-foot putt on Hole 13 to cut New York GC's lead to 4-3 with two holes remaining in the match.\n\nMorikawa ties match on Hole 14\n\nAfter Finau teed him up with a chance to tie the match on the previous hole, Morikawa came through by sinking a nearly 6-foot putt on Hole 14.\n\nBoston Common Golf vs. Atlanta Drive Golf Club\n\nMcIlroy nearly hits 29-foot chip shot\n\nIn a critical outing for Boston to remain in playoff contention, McIlroy was close to giving his team an early lead on Hole 1 as he narrowly missed a 29-foot chip-in. The missed shot left the match tied entering Hole 2.\n\nMatsuyama narrowly misses 21-foot chip-in\n\nMuch like McIlroy earlier, Matsuyama barely missed a chip shot later on Hole 9. A made shot would have given Boston a 3-1 lead over Atlanta, instead, the miss led to a tie on the hole.\n\nThomas hits perfect approach shot\n\nWith a chance to clinch a playoff spot, Thomas came up big for Atlanta hitting an excellent 34-foot approach shot on Hole 13 to get within five feet of the pin, before making the putt on his next shot for birdie.

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nVALLARTA, Mexico -- Brian Campbell cashed in on a huge break Sunday when his tee shot in a playoff bounced out of the trees and back into play, leading to a birdie on the second extra hole to win the Mexico Open over Aldrich Potgieter.\n\nCampbell, who closed with a 1-under 70 at Vidanta Vallarta, won for the first time since he turned pro a decade ago, and the timing could not have been better.\n\nThe victory sends him to the Masters, the Players Championship and the PGA Championship, along with five of the $20 million signature events left on the PGA Tour schedule.\n\n\"To be in this position is just so unreal,\" the 31-year-old Campbell said after calmly holing a birdie putt just inside 4 feet on the 18th green for the win. \"I can't believe it, really.\"\n\nGood golf wasn't enough. Campbell needed the break of a lifetime.\n\nCampbell and Potgieter, who shot 71, each made birdie on the 18th in regulation and began the playoff with a par. Returning to the par-5 closing hole for the third time -- a big advantage for the 20-year-old South African with his power -- Campbell hit a low, hard fade toward the out-of-bounds stakes.\n\nBut it crashed into the trees and popped back out into the rough. He still was 94 yards behind Potgieter, but at least he had a shot. He hit fairway metal to 68 yards short, and hit a lob wedge that checked up just short of the hole.\n\n\"You've got to get those breaks sometimes,\" Campbell said. \"Unfortunately I hit a really bad tee shot there, caught the tree, was able to keep it in play and get ourselves in a good position to get a wedge and keep the pressure on.\n\n\"I was just so happy that I was able to kind of stay in it to the end.\"\n\nPotgieter twice hit the 18th fairway in the playoff and had a 6-iron for his second shot, and both times he made par. The first time was a hard draw over the green. On the second playoff hole, he was posing over a shot on a perfect line until it came up a foot short and into a bunker.\n\nHe blasted out some 6 feet by and missed the birdie putt to the left, setting up Campbell for a moment that once seemed so far away.\n\nHe was winless in 186 starts on the Korn Ferry and PGA Tour combined, earning $1,487,830. His payoff Sunday was $1,260,000.\n\nPotgieter started the final round with a one-shot lead, fell behind with two bogeys to end the front nine, caught up to Campbell with a superb up-and-down on the par-5 14th. They each made one bogey coming in and finished at 20-under 264.\n\nPotgieter, who led the field in driving distance, failed to capitalize on the par-5 closing hole after hitting the fairway each time.\n\n\"Hopefully, my time will come soon,\" said Potgieter, who won the 2022 British Amateur at age 17 and last year became the youngest to win on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\n\"Pressure is a big thing,\" he said. \"You can't beat it. You just have to learn and adjust to it the next time.\"\n\nIsaiah Salinda finished with a bogey-free 65 to finish alone in third. Aaron Rai, at No. 29 in the world the highest-ranked player in the field, briefly shared the lead with an approach to 20 inches for eagle on the par-5 sixth. He was 1 over the rest of the way for a 67 and tied for fourth with Ben Griffin (67).\n\nCampbell said it was grit that helped him win, and that goes back further than Sunday.\n\nHe played his college golf at Illinois and was the low amateur in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay. He earned a PGA Tour card in 2017 and missed the cut 13 times in 20 starts. One of those was the Zurich Classic, where he received a penalty for slow play in a peculiar ruling because it also involved his partner, Miguel Angel Carballo.\n\nAnd then it was back to the minor leagues for the next seven years until he was runner-up three times and finished No. 8 on the Korn Ferry Tour to get another crack at the PGA Tour.\n\nThe victory gives him a two-exemption through 2027 and gives him a busy March and April with the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Players Championship, the Masters and the RBC Heritage all on his schedule.",

He was the missing piece in the Haryana Steelers puzzle last year, and was the diamond that Manpreet Singh wanted.\n\n\u20b92.07 crore at the Pro Kabaddi League auction, and perennial bridesmaid as a coach, Manpreet Singh won his first final in four attempts to give Haryana Steelers their first-ever PKL title. The pain of three silvers as coach, gone with this gold medal - to add to the gold jewelry adorning him already.\n\nIt came in typical Steelers fashion. Manpreet had fashioned a team that squeezed the life out of the opposition with a stellar defence, and that's exactly what they did in the final. The best raiding unit in the PKL - Devank and Ayan Lohchab of Patna Pirates, 477 points between them - were limited to 8 in Pune tonight, and the Steelers triumphed 32-23 to lift the PKL 11 trophy.\n\nAfter an ill-tempered contest on December 6th in the league stage, there was no love lost between the two teams. Manpreet Singh had called the Pirates 'the weakest team' and Shadloui was all bravado in the pre-final utterances. Fans and the neutrals were ready for the PKL's best raiders to give the Steelers their come-uppance. The only problem was, the Steelers came prepared, all ready to back up their big words.\n\nShadloui walked out with a swagger of a champion, certain in the knowledge that he was the best, ever ready to prove it. At the other end, Devank had thrown the gauntlet down with inflammatory pre-match quotes, and Shadloui grabbed it immediately, The Iranian was at his tiger-ish best, swiftly grabbing Devank's right ankle and never letting go, his ankle-hold sending the Pirates raider out in the second raid of the game.\n\nAyan went soon after, and just minutes into the game the Pirates were without their best raiders, both falling to Shadloui's inescapable attentions. This had turned into exactly the game Manpreet wanted, with defences thriving and his Iranian ace in title-winning form.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThree cities, 12 teams and 132 high-octane matches of kabaddi action later, season 11 of the Pro Kabaddi team comes down to the next 5 games. Defending champions Puneri Paltan are out of the playoff picture, and come December 29, the PKL will crown a new champion from the six teams battling it out in Pune.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the PKL 11 playoffs:\n\nWho are the contenders to win PKL 11?\n\nHaryana Steelers: Table-toppers and last season's runners up - chasing a first title in franchise history.\n\nDabang Delhi: PKL 8 champions, with constant playoff appearances.\n\nUP Yoddhas: Making their fourth playoff appearance in seven seasons of existence, also chasing a first title.\n\nPatna Pirates: The most successful team in PKL history (3-time winners) but looking to win a first title in six years.\n\nU Mumba: PKL 2 champions, enjoying a resurgence after dismal last three seasons.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers: Seeking to join Patna Pirates as the most successful PKL franchise, last champions in PKL 9.\n\nHow do the PKL playoffs work?\n\nIt's familiar enough for Indian sports afficionados now - with all top franchise leagues like the IPL and ISL also following the six-team playoff format.\n\nHaryana Steelers and Dabang Delhi, by virtue of finishing first and second in the table respectively, make a direct entry into the semifinals. Their opponents will be decided two eliminators, taking place between the teams that finished third to sixth.\n\nThird-placed UP Yoddhas faces Jaipur Pink Panthers (6th) in the first eliminator, with the winner of this contest facing Haryana Steelers in the semifinal. Patna Pirates (4th) face U Mumba (5th) in the other eliminator, with the winner taking on Dabang Delhi in the semifinal.\n\nPKL 11 playoffs schedule:\n\nDecember 26: Eliminator 1: UP Yoddhas vs Jaipur Pink Panthers at 8 pm, Eliminator 2: Patna Pirates vs U Mumba at 9 pm.\n\nDecember 27: Haryana Steelers vs winner of Eliminator 1 at 8 pm, Dabang Delhi vs winner of Eliminator 2 at 9 pm.\n\nDecember 29: Final at 8 pm.\n\nWhat do the playoff matchups look like?\n\nUP Yoddhas vs Jaipur Pink Panthers - winner faces Haryana Steelers\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers have only managed the single victory against the other teams who made it to the playoffs this season, and as luck would have had it - it came against the UP Yoddhas. Both teams boast of excellent lead raiders with more than decent defensive prowess. It's no surprise then, that the games between the two teams were tight affairs, JPP winning 33-30 on November 5, before the Yoddhas had their revenge on November 28, winning 33-29.\n\nThe Panthers are still heavily reliant on Arjun Deshwal who's the third-best raider in the league with 228 points. Ankush Rathee and Reza Mirbagheri lead their defence, but they'll have a tough time stopping the Yoddhas who can attack on multiple fronts via Bhavani Rajput, Gagan Gowda and Bharat Hooda. Coaches Jasveer Singh and Upendra Malik have fashioned a competent defence around Sumit Sangwan and Hitesh, which makes this contest incredibly hard to call. The Yoddhas have a slight advantage when it comes to scoring, and if they shut down Deshwal (which is easier said than done), Jaipur don't have an impressive plan B. However, coach Sanjeev Baliyan has been there and done it twice (winning PKL 3 with Patna Pirates and PKL 9 with the Panthers) and he might have an ace up his sleeve.\n\nThe coaches of the qualified teams pose next to the PKL trophy. PKL\n\nThe issue for either team, of course, is that their reward for victory is a match against table-toppers Haryana Steelers. Manpreet Singh has continued with his defence-first approach, and it's incredibly hard to beat his side. There's some hope after the Steelers lost to the Yoddhas recently, but that was after the table-toppers had already sealed their semifinal spot and taken their eye off the ball. The spreading out of raiding responsibilities (Vinay, Shivan Patare) as well as defensive onus (Mohammadreza Shadloui, Rahul Sethpal) has meant that's its nigh-on impossible to craft specific strategies against the Steelers. After a runners-up finish last season, it's very likely that Manpreet Singh will complete his coaching journey with the title this year - all thanks to the strength of his all-round collective.\n\nPatna Pirates vs U Mumba - winner faces Dabang Delhi\n\nIt's the poster-game for PKL's focus on youth this season, as Patna Pirates take on U Mumba is a battle of franchises that have platformed new-ish faces this season. In 22 games this season, the Pirates have scored 125 points more than U Mumba, topping the league with 884 points. Yet, when it comes to a straight fight between the two, it's U Mumba's Iranian coach Gholamreza Mazandarani who outsmarts Narender Redhu as he's won both games against the Pirates this season - which played a large part in their qualification for the playoffs.\n\nThe Pirates are a scoring machine, with Devank the league's top-scoring raider (280 pts), coupled with Ayan Lohchab's 172 points. Ankit Jaglan, Shubham Shinde and Deepak Singh handle defensive duties for the side, but when things get tough, it's often the Pirates' defence that can't keep up. They conceded points at crucial junctures in both losses against U Mumba, and that can prove their downfall. 19% of Ajit Chouhan's impressive 180 points this season have come against the Pirates, and he clearly has their number. This contest could hinge around this battle, as U Mumba have limited the Devank-Ayan combination better than the rest of the league.\n\nThe triumph of youth will face up to one of the most threatening sides in PKL history - Dabang Delhi have broken the single-season record for consecutive unbeaten games (14) - and one wonders what records could have been achieved had Naveen Kumar been fit for the first seven games of the season. In his absence at the start of the season, Ashu Malik came to the fore and has even gone on to eclipse the Naveen Express, with his 256 points the second-best in the league. Coach Joginder Narwal also has one of the best defenders in the league in Yogesh Dahiya and will be relying on him to marshal a somewhat underperforming defence. That defence struggled in losses to the Pirates and U Mumba earlier in the season, and a quest for a first title since season 8 could come undone if Dabang Delhi aren't on their A-game.",

                "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nTwo-thirds of the Pro Kabaddi League's 11th season is done, and with the Noida leg witnessing 44 tightly contested games, we are closer to finding out who will make the playoffs as the season concludes in Pune.\n\nHaryana Steelers have been the only consistent force so far, but with seven other teams in the mix for the other five playoff spots - and three having an outside chance - it's been a thrilling season of kabaddi.\n\nHere's how every team has performed this season so far (grades only for the second leg in Noida):\n\nHaryana Steelers\n\nGrade: A+\n\nFrom seventh in the table after the Hyderabad leg, Manpreet Singh's Steelers have simply rocketed up the standings to first, opening a nine-point lead to boot. Eight wins from nine games in Noida have been the cause, with the loss to the Telugu Titans their only blemish.\n\nThey were already the league's best defensive outfit, and Mohammadreza Shadloui's stellar form (51 tackle points) has meant it's incredibly hard to score on the Steelers. Raiding was a bit of an issue in Hyderabad, but the trio of Vinay (108 points), Shivam Patare (89 points) and Shadloui (87 points) have ensured that they have become the most feared outfit in the league.\n\nSteelers ended the Noida leg with a point differential of +78 from their eight wins, and the next seven in Pune seem all set for another spell of victories. The playoffs are all but a certainty, and should they keep up their form, Manpreet Singh's side look all set to bring home a first title.\n\nPatna Pirates\n\nGrade: A\n\nPatna Pirates have flown up the table with five wins from eight in Noida - but it's been the manner of those wins that have left jaws dropped. They earned a massive +85 point difference from those wins, even while the Noida leg also saw them lose two and tie one.\n\nIt's easy enough to explain the Pirates' form - they have the league's best scorer in Devank Dalal (194 points) and alongside Ayan Lohchab (128 points) they have the best raiding unit in PKL 11. This youthful left-right pairing have been a destructive force that are rarely halted. However, the Paltan's focus on scoring hasn't stopped defenders like Ankit Jaglan from collecting an impressive 47 tackle points.\n\nThese pages said the title was unlikely for this outfit at the end of the Hyderabad leg but given Devank's consistency (11 Super 10s from 15 games), they have quite the chance when they do make the playoffs. Let's put it this way, the Pirates are a team most want to avoid; and that only speaks volumes of how good they've been.\n\nPro Kabaddi League\n\nDabang Delhi\n\nGrade: A-\n\nThree ties, three wins - Dabang Delhi left Noida extending their season's unbeaten run to eight, thanks in no small part to Naveen Kumar's return. This doesn't mean that Ashu Malik has slowed down to let the Naveen Express by, if anything he's only been buoyed to greater heights, with 12 Super 10s from 15 games - the best in the league.\n\nWith 164 raid points, he's the second-best in the league, and Dabang Delhi's climb from fourth to third in the standings signifies that they can take on quality defence in the playoffs. Yogesh Dahiya's defensive prowess has meant that even when the raiding unit doesn't work, Delhi still are in with a chance, as evidenced by their penchant for ties.\n\nTheir final seven games in Pune aren't the easiest, but Delhi have the calibre to beat anyone on their day - which should be enough to make the playoffs.\n\nTelugu Titans\n\nGrade: B\n\nThe Titans are capable of inflicting a massive 22-point loss on league leaders Haryana Steelers without their talisman Pawan Sehrawat one day and then go on to lose to second-from-bottom Gujarat Giants five days later. It's no secret that Pawan's absence has been felt of late, despite four wins in Noida from seven. It's an inconsistency that's seen them go from second to fourth, although they remain quite likely to make the playoffs.\n\nIncredibly Pawan's 95 points from 9 games still has him in the top 10 point-scorers of the league, despite others playing six games more. Vijay Malik has taken up primary raiding duties in Pawan's absence and has the same number of Super 10s now (6) while eclipsing him in points (126). Sagar Sethpal Rawal remains a powerhouse in defence, although the Titans remain worryingly likely to concede all-outs (they are the second worst in the league).\n\nStill, this is a far cry from last season, and Krishan Kumar Hooda deserves credit for fashioning an outfit that looks all set to make the playoffs.\n\nPuneri Paltan\n\nGrade: D\n\nThe rails have come off the Paltan in the Noida leg. Pro Kabaddi League\n\nThe rails have come off the Paltan in the Noida leg, with the defending champions dropping from first place at the end of the Hyderabad leg to fifth in Noida. They got just two wins from seven and they came against Bengal Warriors and Gujarat Giants who 10th and 11th in the standings. Two losses to the Panthers, a blowout loss against table-toppers Steelers and two costly ties against Delhi and the Yoddhas have seen Puneri Paltan plummet in the standings.\n\nAslam Inamdar's injury has been a bridge too far for the defending champions, even if Pankaj Mohite claims otherwise - and his 75 points have been quietly impressive. However, the defence has struggled (aside from Gaurav Khatri), even though they have been second best in the league at inflicting all-outs. It would be the quite the surprise if they miss out on the playoffs, but if the downward trend continues, that could be a possibility for the defending champions.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers\n\nGrade: B\n\nJaipur won five of their eight games in Noida, including impressive victories twice over the Telugu Titans and Puneri Paltan. However, it's the blowout losses to Dabang Delhi and Haryana Steelers that raise questions about their ability against the league's best teams.\n\nArjun Deshwal became the second-youngest player ever to cross the 1100 raid point mark and is the third-best raider in the league currently (165 points, 7 Super 10s). His consistency is a bankable option for coach Sanjeev Baliyan, who has seen his defence struggle against top raiders. Should they make the playoffs, which is fairly likely, Jaipur will have to ensure that their defensive prowess matches that of Deshwal if they are to win the title.\n\nJaipur Pink Panthers won five of their eight games in the Noida leg Pro Kabaddi League\n\nU Mumba\n\nGrade: C\n\nOn paper, U Mumba may be seventh in the table, but it's a bit of a misnomer since they have played one game fewer than the six teams above. Win that, and U Mumba climb to third - which is where they were at the end of the Hyderabad leg. It's a testament to how tight the league is, and U Mumba are becoming specialists at narrow wins. Their four wins in Noida only came via a +8 point differential, and it's that penchant for keeping their nerve that could prove crucial in the playoffs.\n\nCaptain Sunil Kumar's young guns, led by Ajit Chouhan (114 points, 5 Super 10s) are the league's dark horses, since they can surprise anyone on their day. However, the two losses to Telugu Titans in Noida should give Iranian coach Gholamreza Mazandarani pause, as should a blowout loss against league leaders Haryana Steelers.\n\nUP Yoddhas\n\nGrade: B-\n\nTenth after the Hyderabad leg, eighth after the Noida leg - the UP Yoddhas have improved a fair bit, and with four wins and a tie from seven games in front of their home crowd, they have a shot at the playoffs, only trailing sixth place by three points and with a game in hand.\n\nBharat Hooda's form has been crucial to the Yoddhas' uptick in fortunes - he's the second-best all-rounder in the league so far, although he's mainly scored with his raiding. Bhavani Rajput's raiding (78 points) and Sumit Sangwan's tackling prowess (47 points) have backed up Hooda's feats, and after impressive wins over the Panthers, Titans and Pirates, it seems like the Yoddhas might actually make the playoffs this season.\n\nTamil Thalaivas\n\nGrade: D\n\nThe Tamil Thalaivas maddening inconsistency continued in Noida, where they lost to the UP Yoddhas by 16 points and then defeated the same team by 14 points four days later. The Thalaivas have a 13-point deficit to the playoff spots, with only seven games remaining - which ought to see them miss out.\n\nNarender Kandola and Sachin Tanwar's raiding form has dipped, which has seen them drop from 5th and 6th in the raid point rankings to 13th and 20th. Kandola's injury further complicates matters, since it's clear that this is the area where the Thalaivas have suffered. Nitesh Kumar's 51 tackle points (one shy of the league's best) has seen the franchise earn the most tackle points in the league (183). Moein Shafaghi's recent form could see the Thailavas make a bid for the playoff spots, but it seems unlikely at the moment.\n\nBengal Warriorz\n\nGrade: F\n\nBengal Warriorz have crashed from fifth in the standings at the end of the Hyderabad leg to tenth currently. Noida proved an unhappy hunting ground, as the Warriorz lost all seven of their games here, with a score difference of -79 seeing them plummet down the table.\n\nNitin Kumar has emerged as the team's best raider, even though Maninder Singh became only the second player in PKL history to cross 1500 raid points in their most recent game. Along with Fazel Atrachali, the Warriorz's big names have performed relatively well, but the lack of impact from the supporting cast as well as unfortunate choices in the closing moments have seen them go on a seven-game losing streak. Even if the Pune leg witnesses a change in fortunes, they may be too far gone to earn a playoff spot.\n\nGujarat Giants\n\nGrade: C\n\nGujarat Giants have bounced back quite well in Noida, winning three and tying one of their eight games, but the damage done in Hyderabad has meant they are unlikely to make the playoff spots. To overcome a gap of 20 points with eight games left might just be too much.\n\nCoach Ram Meher Singh can give thanks to the Bengal Warriorz for this uptick in fortunes, with two wins against them in Noida. Guman Singh starred in those wins, and it's no surprise that he's finally repaying the amount spent on him to climb to eighth in the points scored rankings (110). The Giants finally look like a cohesive outfit, and while they may not be in the playoffs themselves, they could prove pivotal in deciding who gets there.\n\nBengaluru Bulls\n\nGrade: F\n\nThe Bulls played seven games in Noida and lost all of them. Only their two matches against U Mumba were close, losing the first by a point and the next by two, but for most of the season, they've been blown away by the opposition. They've conceded the most points in the league (595), and the next worse team is better off by 60 points.\n\nIt's a testimony to their lack of options that Pardeep Narwal is their top-scoring raider with 68 points - a total bettered by 18 other raiders in the league. Nitin Rawal is a lone bright spot, leading the league in tackle points (52), but the Bulls penchant for conceding all-outs means they're unlikely to finish anything but last come the end of the season.",
