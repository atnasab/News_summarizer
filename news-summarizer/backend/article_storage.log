The Sodalitium, in a January 21 communique, said they had so far paid in excess of $5 million in damages to victims of abuse.

Bond markets are influenced by many factors but the primary domestic pressure is the prospect of persistent inflation, with interest rates staying high for longer as a consequence.
Higher inflation reduces the purchasing power of the coupon, and higher interest rates make the bond less competitive because investors can now buy bonds paying a higher rate.
