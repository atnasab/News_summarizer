Extreme weather drove up crop prices in multiple countries in the region in 2023, the report, which was written by several UN agencies including the World Food Program (WFP), says.
Though the report credits social safety nets with a measurable decrease in undernourishment throughout Latin America, it notes that the region’s poorest and most vulnerable populations are still more likely to suffer from food insecurity due to climate change – especially rural people.
“The shocks are getting much more extreme,” said Lola Castro, the WFP’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.
One solution may lie in the region’s traditional foods, such as quinoa, and tuberous root vegetables like mashua and melloco, among others..

A papal decision to dissolve or suppress a Catholic religious community is rare and in the Sodalitium’s case follows attempts by the church hierarchy to reform the group and a 2023 Vatican investigation which uncovered “sadistic” abuses of power, authority and spirituality.
One of those expelled was found to have carried out “abuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism,” an unusual charge.
The Sodalitium, in a January 21 communique, said they had so far paid in excess of $5 million in damages to victims of abuse.
A turning point came with a 2015 book, “Half Monks, Half Soldiers,” written by one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, and journalist Paola Ugaz..
