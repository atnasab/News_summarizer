Training for criminal justice system staff to help them recognise possible victims and greater access to self-defence for victims who use force against their abuser were other demands while the Ministry of Justice was urged to provide a defence where victims of domestic abuse are coerced into offending.
"In previous inspections we have commented that specialist domestic abuse services - who play a vital role - are critically underfunded," he said.

The executive order basically breaks down into China and the rest of the world.
But much of the executive order goes specifically after China, the world’s second-biggest economy and the United States’ third-biggest trade partner.

The Biden administration resolved seven outstanding disputes in the World Trade Organization (WTO) with India, but the idea of a bigger trade deal between the two countries never got off the ground.
The USJTA is not a free trade agreement, but it has some key features of one, particularly involving tariff cuts in several sectors on both sides.

These shifts have ushered in two surprising diplomatic developments: deepening engagement between India and the Taliban and a slowly growing Bangladesh-Pakistan relationship.
Since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021, Indian officials have held meetings with the group’s leaders.
Taliban forces attacked Indian targets during the conflict, including a bombing outside the Indian Embassy in Kabul in 2009.

2025-01-22 15:57:11,487 - INFO - Summary of article 6790c310b88ff110e5fddeeb is: The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law signed by President Joe Biden last April that mandated that ByteDance sell TikTok within 270 days or face a ban in the United States.
The congressional coalescence around a TikTok ban forced Biden’s hand after months of negotiations, said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University.
By the letter of the law, TikTok will be illegal in the United States starting Sunday.
As with most other aspects of the TikTok ban, we’ve been here before.

2025-01-22 15:57:11,939 - INFO - Summary of article 6790c310b88ff110e5fddeec is: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who supported a TikTok ban but failed to implement one during his first term, did a U-turn on the app last year, largely assumed to be influenced by major Republican donor and TikTok investor Jeff Yass.
That leaves the possibility of a deal: ideally for Trump, the sale of TikTok to one of his ideological allies.
The president-elect attempted to broker a deal in 2020 for Oracle to buy TikTok, which fell through.
TikTok users are furious about the U.S. ban, but a previous effort to rally supporters against the law misfired.
But the shift signals a possible future of the United States playing whack-a-mole with successful Chinese-owned apps, barring the passage of a more sweeping law..

The Salt Typhoon breach has far-reaching implications.
Salt Typhoon may have produced data on a scale that is more difficult for China to process.
Salt Typhoon also managed to penetrate parts of the U.S. government that work directly on issues of major concern to Beijing, such as the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions department.
Salt Typhoon is hardening anti-China consensus in Washington at an already volatile time, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office..

The fact that Aoun is favored by Washington and admired by the U.S. military leadership makes him even less attractive to Hezbollah.
For several years, Aoun spearheaded major reform of the Lebanese army in close partnership with the United States.
The Aoun pill was a bitter one to swallow, but then came the shock of Salam, which caused Hezbollah to almost choke.

Concerns about Syria’s political transition are justified.
Now, it is hardly surprising that Sharaa’s vision for Syria’s political and legal system will derive from ideas plucked from political Islam.

States such as Lebanon and Denmark have revoked or refused refugee status for Syrians who made visits home.
Involuntarily deporting refugees or prematurely revoking their refugee status undermines the sustainability of refugees’ returns.
With deepening labor crises facing European governments’ aging workforces, it is not necessarily prudent for them to rush to send refugees back.
Syrian refugees will be central to rebuilding their country, whether by returning or providing political and economic support from the diaspora..

However, that was before Trump mentioned military and economic might as potential leverage to gain “ownership” of Greenland.
Denmark colonized Greenland in 1721, when Hans Egede, a Danish Norwegian missionary, first stepped on the ice in Nuuk.
