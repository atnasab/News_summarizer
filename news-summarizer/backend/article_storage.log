His lawyers outlined arguments in defense of Yoon’s martial law declaration, saying it was meant to sound the alarm over abuses committed by the opposition Democratic Party.
Helicopters landing at parliamentThe Constitutional Court began the trial on Dec. 27 to review an impeachment motion that accused Yoon of violating his constitutional duty by imposing martial law with no justifiable grounds.
One of the lawyers also criticized unproven claims of irregularities at the election commission, which Yoon cited as a factor for justifying martial law.
The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether to remove Yoon from office permanently or reinstate him..

A papal decision to dissolve or suppress a Catholic religious community is rare and in the Sodalitium’s case follows attempts by the church hierarchy to reform the group and a 2023 Vatican investigation which uncovered “sadistic” abuses of power, authority and spirituality.
Its founder, Luis Fernando Figari, had earlier been found to have sodomized recruits along with accusations of serious financial mismanagement, according to a 2017 outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium.
One of those expelled was found to have carried out “abuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism,” an unusual charge.
Ugaz told CNN she believed the pope’s decision is “unprecedented” as it is the first time that “a Catholic organization that abused its members and committed economic misconduct” has been suppressed..

Moldova is neither financially nor structurally capable of replacing all Russian gas and Russian gas-generated electricity until 2026.
This greater isolation of Transnistria has reinforced the ties of this breakaway region with the heart of Moldova while weakening Russia’s influence.

To that end, more than 60 senior trans-Atlantic defense leaders—including the authors of this article—have outlined a new NATO deal for the United States.
If both sides of the Atlantic agree, it could represent an early win for the Trump administration while sustaining U.S. commitments to NATO.
The third challenge is the United States’ growing global defense responsibilities and justified desire to redistribute defense burdens more evenly.
Loans and loan guarantees would be made to NATO members and their defense industries to implement the ambitious defense plans outlined above..

However, that was before Trump mentioned military and economic might as potential leverage to gain “ownership” of Greenland.
Denmark colonized Greenland in 1721, when Hans Egede, a Danish Norwegian missionary, first stepped on the ice in Nuuk.
On several occasions, Chinese investors were ready to open up for business in Greenland, but Denmark prevented it.
Recently, one of Greenland’s two representatives in the Danish Parliament, Aki-Mathilda Hoegh-Dam, called for Greenland to become an independent state..
