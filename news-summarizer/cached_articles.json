            "text": "After millions of Los Angeles County residents received evacuation alerts by mistake, countless Angelenos received more erroneous warnings while the county tries to improve its alert system.\n\n\u201cThere is a technical glitch, and we apologize for the confusion and anxiety that any of this has for anybody in the public,\u201d said Bryan LaSota, emergency management coordinator for Los Angeles County\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.\n\nThe errant warnings fueled panic and frustration in the nation\u2019s most populous county, where several wildfires still rage out of control. But authorities say the county\u2019s emergency alerts have also saved countless lives, giving residents time to flee before flames engulf their homes.\n\nWhile authorities cite unspecified technical flaws for this week\u2019s messaging problems, a larger issue remains.\n\nSome residents get emergency alerts on their phones based on their proximity to cell phone towers in those affected areas \u2013 not based on where they live. In other words: If your home is at risk of burning down, but you\u2019re at work on the other side of town, you might not get a cell phone alert saying your home is under an evacuation warning.\n\nThe two-day messaging debacle started Thursday, shortly after the Kenneth Fire broke out. Emergency officials tried to send an alert only to people in the Calabasas and Agoura Hills areas, LaSota told CNN.\n\n\u201cThe first technical glitch is that it went out county-wide, instead of to the affected area,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, residents throughout the county of almost 10 million people received an urgent message on their cell phones.\n\nAfter the error was discovered \u201cWe had to cancel that one,\u201d LaSota said.\n\nBut the problems continued Friday when residents were startled by pre-dawn alerts.\n\nNo one should have received such warnings before dawn Friday, LaSota said.\n\n\u201cDue to an error in the technology \u2026 people are receiving them today, even though they were sent yesterday,\u201d he said.\n\nLaSota and other emergency officials said a detailed investigation is underway to try to determine the cause.\n\nFriday evening, Los Angeles County said it was temporarily moving to the state\u2019s emergency notification system.",

            "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN \u2014\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said forces operating in the Kursk region of Russia have captured two North Korean soldiers, marking the first time that Kyiv has captured alive soldiers from the isolated state.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers have captured North Korean military personnel in the Kursk region. Two soldiers, though wounded, survived and were transported to Kyiv, where they are now communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said Saturday in a statement on X, which included several images of the injured soldiers.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian and Western assessments, some 11,000 North Korean troops are deployed in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces occupy several hundred square kilometers after staging a cross-border incursion in August last year.\n\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the last week of December.\n\nZelensky said of the two Korean soldiers who had been captured: \u201cThis was not an easy task: Russian forces and other North Korean military personnel usually execute their wounded to erase any evidence of North Korea\u2019s involvement in the war against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nA video and still photograph show a Russian military ID which Ukraine claims was carried by a North Korean soldier taken captive by Ukrainian forces. CNN has blurred the name and date of birth on the ID. Security Service of Ukraine\n\nSoldiers in bunk beds\n\nThe Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, released video purportedly showing the soldiers.\n\nIn the video, the SBU spokesman says one of the North Koreans was captured on January 9 by Ukrainian special forces, and the other by Ukrainian paratroopers.\n\n\u201cThey are being held in appropriate conditions that meet the requirements of international law,\u201d the SBU said.\n\nThe video shows the two soldiers in bunk beds in a cell. One has a wound to his jaw. Neither is heard speaking. An unidentified doctor says that the second soldier has a fractured leg.\n\nThe SBU spokesman said that \u201ccommunication with them is carried out through interpreters of Korean,\u201d in cooperation with South Korean intelligence services.\n\nSaturday\u2019s capture is the first time that Ukraine has caught North Korean soldiers alive from the battlefield.\n\nThe SBU released images of a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person from Tuva in Russia, which it said was being carried by one of the captured soldiers. According to the SBU, the soldier said he had been issued the document in Russia last autumn. He also said that some of North Korea\u2019s combat units had just one week of training with Russian troops. The other captive had no documents, the SBU said.\n\nThe soldier said he had been in the North Korean military and had thought he was being sent to Russia for training rather than combat, according to the SBU\u2019s account.\n\nIt comes as Ukraine on Sunday renewed its offensive on Kursk, where its troops have been holding territory after last summer\u2019s shock incursion.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said on Tuesday that it had conducted a precision strike on a Russian military command post near the town of Belaya.\n\nAlthough Kyiv\u2019s troops quickly advanced through Kursk in the summer \u2013 in the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II \u2013 Russia eventually managed to push the forces back. The lines had been mostly static for weeks before Ukraine\u2019s latest push.\n\nIn his daily address on Monday, Zelensky said the Kursk offensive was important in preventing Russia from redirecting its troops to Donetsk and other regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nDespite both sides being drained after nearly three years of war, frontline fighting has ramped up in recent weeks. With Donald Trump set to return to the White House this month \u2013 promising to end the war in a day, without saying how \u2013 Moscow and Kyiv appear to be making an 11th-hour push to gobble up territory and strengthen their negotiating hands ahead of potential peace talks.\n\nThis story has been updated.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nViolent protests have erupted in China after the death of a teenage boy sparked accusations of a cover-up by authorities, videos from the northwestern region of Shaanxi have shown.\n\nIn videos verified by CNN, dozens of protesters are seen confronting a wall of riot police outside the Pucheng Vocational Technical School, with some hurling batons and other objects towards the officers.\n\nOne of the protesters was seen hurling a fire extinguisher at a door, shattering its glass. In response, police are seen aggressively handling the demonstrators, beating some and throwing others to the ground.\n\nThe trigger for the protests was the death of a teenage student, whose surname was Dang and who was in his third year at the school. Local authorities in Pucheng have claimed Dang\u2019s death on January 2 was an accident and not criminal, but allegations have swirled on social media that there has been a cover-up.\n\nChinese authorities have been particularly wary of public protests in the country following the widespread \u201cWhite Paper\u201d demonstrations in late 2022 against Beijing\u2019s hardline policies during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nVideos showed violent clashes between police and protesters outside the school. Social media\n\nAccording to a statement from investigators posted on the Pucheng county government\u2019s website, Dang \u201chad a verbal and physical altercation\u201d with a first-year student surnamed Guo over \u201cdisturbing his rest\u201d in his dormitory. That night, a school official helped resolve the argument.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., another student in Dang\u2019s dormitory went to the restroom, where he found a wooden stool underneath the balcony window, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThe sliding window was open, and the metal mesh screen has been removed. Dang had already fallen from the window to the ground below,\u201d it said.\n\nHuman Rights In China, a US-based activist group, reported \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d leading to Dang\u2019s death, including witness reports of \u201csigns of a struggle in Dang\u2019s dormitory\u201d and the suggestion that he was \u201cpushed from the roof.\u201d\n\nThe group said Dang\u2019s family has rejected the official explanation of his death. The family also claimed that photos from his cell phone had been deleted, Reuters reported. The family\u2019s skepticism has been amplified widely on social media.\n\nIt is unclear whether the protests, which began Monday, continued throughout the week.\n\nCalls by CNN to the public security bureau of Pucheng county, as well as that of Weinan city \u2013 which the county is part of \u2013 went unanswered.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThis week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan\u2019s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHow did the country get here?\n\nFor 20 months, two of Sudan\u2019s most powerful generals \u2013 Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more.\n\nSudan's top army general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan speaks during a press conference in 2021. Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe RSF's Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, is seen in Khartoum in 2023. Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters\n\nThe two men \u2013 former allies \u2013 jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from office in 2019. Together, they also contributed to another coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized power from the country\u2019s transitional government.\n\nToday, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country\u2019s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum.\n\nMore than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan.\n\nHunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned.\n\nWho has been cited as responsible?\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti\u2019s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated \u201cdirect attacks against civilians\u201d including the systematic murder of \u201cmen and boys \u2013 even infants \u2013 on an ethnic basis.\u201d\n\nThey also \u201cdeliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\u201d Blinken said, adding that the same forces \u201ctargeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,\u201d he announced.\n\nThe RSF described the decision by the US as \u201cunjust,\u201d adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that \u201cthe State Department\u2019s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide \u2026 The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,\u201d the RSF statement said.\n\nThe RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead.\n\nSince fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF, ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide.\n\nWest Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups were massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, \u201cfor his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,\u201d and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual \u201cfor their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.\u201d\n\nAre both warring factions complicit in abuses?\n\nIn September last year, a United Nations fact-finding mission accused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes.\n\nAnd in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. \u201cThe United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.\u201d\n\nSudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF.\n\nIn Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been \u201cused as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,\u201d \u2013 a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same method and strategy,\u201d she said of the alleged sexual crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.\u201d\n\nAl-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan\u2019s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said.\n\n\u201cThe RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,\u201d she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti.\n\nCivilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF \u2013 targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties.\n\nPeople gather near a destroyed vehicle, following shelling in Omdurman, Sudan on December 10, 2024. Khartoum State Government via Reuters\n\nLast month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency\u2019s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up \u201cthe deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,\u201d the UN said.\n\nDozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF\u2019s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October.\n\nThe RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking \u201cwidespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter but has not yet received a response.\n\nWhat is the impact on civilians?\n\nBefore the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world\u2019s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth.\n\nTheir war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures.\n\nSome of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur\u2019s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment.\n\nA woman and baby are seen at the Zamzam displacement camp, close to El Fasher in North Darfur, Sudan in 2018. Mohamed Zakaria/MSF/Reuters\n\nHunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people to eat \u201cgrass and peanut shells\u201d to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger.\n\nFood deliveries to Darfur resumed last August after a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week.\n\nOn Friday, humanitarian group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters.\n\n\u201cThe medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,\u201d MSF\u2019s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement.\n\nHow has the world responded to the war?\n\nThe Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year.\n\nHowever, warring factions in the African nation have also defied global efforts to end the conflict.\n\nLast month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were.\n\n\u201cTo the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries \u2013 enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict \u2013 enough,\u201d he said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken addresses the United Nations Security Council on Sudan in December 2024. Richard Drew/AP\n\nSudan\u2019s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: \u201cThe UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.\u201d\n\nA CNN investigation in 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time.\n\nIn November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan\u2019s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan\u2019s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia\u2019s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWill the US genocide determination make a difference?\n\nSudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US\u2019 determination of genocide in Sudan was \u201clong overdue\u201d and should have happened sooner.\n\nNonetheless, it is \u201ca form of justice because it recognizes victims\u2019 grievances,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,\u201d added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.\n\nFor activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFour lynx \u201cillegally released\u201d into the Scottish Highlands have been captured by park rangers in a rollercoaster two-day rescue effort.\n\nThe search began on Wednesday afternoon when two lynx were spotted in the Cairngorms National Park, one of the last truly wild places remaining in the UK. The animals were captured the following day, lured with bait into humane traps.\n\nTwo additional lynx, which appeared to have been \u201cdeliberately abandoned,\u201d were later spotted on camera traps Thursday night in the same region, according to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).\n\nOne of the lynx has since died, RZSS told CNN Saturday.\n\nThe 48-hour rescue effort was initially declared a victory by conservation groups, but the discovery of the medium-sized cats \u2013 which once roamed free in Scotland \u2013 has sparked fears that some might be taking rewildling into their own hands.\n\nLynx tend to ignore humans and don\u2019t generally pose a threat, according to wildlife experts. Some conservationists have called for the lynx to be released back into the Scottish Highlands, but reintroducing the lost species has long been a thorny issue.\n\nDavid Field, chief executive of RZSS, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program that there are \u201crogue rewilders out there\u201d who ignore international best practice with regard to the reintroduction of species.\n\n\u201cThey are impatient and then proceed in a way which is this rebellious rogue rewilding. That\u2019s really sad and that\u2019s a real, real risk,\u201d he said.\n\nConservationists have condemned the release, saying that the animals -- photographed in Scotland -- would be unlikely to survive in the wild. Royal Zoological Society of Scotland\n\nEdward Mountain, Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said the second lynx capture \u201cwould suggest a concerted approach to illegally reintroduce lynx,\u201d according to PA Media.\n\nPolice Scotland and rangers from the Cairngorms National Park Authority joined the mammoth rescue effort and inquiries are being made into how the animals ended up roaming free in the park.\n\nThe second pair of cats were captured at around 6:30 p.m. local time on January 10 within the Kingussie region of the park and taken to the nearby Highland Wildlife Park to be assessed by vets, RZSS said.\n\nThe cats will be moved into quarantine for 30 days at Edinburgh Zoo, RZSS added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster 48 hours, with people working throughout the day and night, in some extremely challenging conditions,\u201d Dr Helen Senn, RZSS Head of Conservation said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nSenn added that they don\u2019t think there are any more lynx in the park but will continue to monitor the release site.\n\nHighland Wildlife Park said in a statement on Facebook that they \u201ccondemn the illegal release of these lynx in the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very unlikely they would have survived in the wild,\u201d the park added.",

            "title": "Australian Open: With an old rival at his side, Novak Djokovic resumes his quest for a 25th grand slam title",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nNovak Djokovic and Andy Murray faced each other 36 times throughout their tennis careers, mostly in finals and often at the sharp end of grand slam tournaments. But at this year\u2019s Australian Open, their decades-long rivalry has taken an unexpected turn.\n\nIn his ongoing pursuit of a record-breaking 25th major title, Djokovic has enlisted Murray, recently retired but not prepared to walk away from tennis entirely, as part of his coaching team.\n\nIt was an arresting sight for tennis fans when the pair first appeared in Melbourne together this week, Djokovic striking balls in practice and Murray looking on with hawk-like attention. But might this unusual player-coach partnership make sense?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in search of perfection that Novak Djokovic, I think, hires Andy Murray,\u201d seven-time grand slam champion and Eurosport expert Mats Wilander told CNN Sport.\n\n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t think that he\u2019s going to be five percent better because of Andy Murray \u2026 We\u2019re talking about one or two points here and there,\u201d Wilander added. \u201cMurray might have some valuable information that Novak hasn\u2019t thought about before, and that could be the difference between him winning his 25th grand slam title or not.\u201d\n\nCurrently tied with Australian Margaret Court at the top of the all-time list, Djokovic was expected to become tennis\u2019 outright grand slam singles leader with one more title last year. But despite adding an Olympic gold medal to his trophy cabinet, he went the whole season without winning a major crown for the first time since 2017, falling short against Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.\n\nAt the upcoming Australian Open, a tournament he has won a record 10 times before, Djokovic resumes his quest for tennis history.\n\nFour months out from his 38th birthday, he would comfortably be the oldest grand slam singles champion in the Open era should he triumph in Melbourne, though we have seen many times how the Serbian star can bend and flex his body in ways that defy his advancing years.\n\nThese days, rather than play a full schedule, Djokovic tends to target a handful of tournaments in order to preserve his fitness and prolong his career. Such an approach means that his ranking has suffered, and he enters the Australian Open as the seventh seed with a tricky draw in front of him.\n\nFour-time grand slam champion Alcaraz could be Djokovic\u2019s opponent as soon as the quarterfinal, perhaps the latest instalment in what has become an intriguing rivalry.\n\n\u201cHe needs a bit of luck,\u201d Sa\u0161a Ozmo, a journalist for Sportklub who has covered Djokovic\u2019s career extensively, told CNN Sport prior to the draw. \u201cBut I think if it can open just a bit for him and if he can get into the groove, slowly but surely, I\u2019d say he\u2019s among the favorites. Not the top favorite, but among the favorites.\u201d\n\nJannik Sinner, the world No. 1 and defending Australian Open champion, enters the men\u2019s draw as the player to beat. He won his first grand slam title in Melbourne last year, then ended 2024 with victories at the US Open and the ATP Finals to cement his place at the top of the rankings.\n\nAlcaraz, meanwhile, could become the youngest player to achieve a career grand slam \u2013 needing only the Australian Open to complete a sweep of the majors four months before his 22nd birthday \u2013 and second seed Alexander Zverev continues to chase a first grand slam title after a strong season last year.\n\nAlcaraz is looking to complete a career grand slam.

William West/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut no one will be discounting Djokovic from triumphing once more at his favored event, even after he was surprisingly beaten in straight sets by Reilly Opelka at the Brisbane International last week.\n\nIn former world No. 1 and three-time grand slam champion Murray, he not only has a coach who is familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the world\u2019s top players, but also a friend and rival helping him to raise his game.\n\n\u201cI think that motivation is a big thing,\u201d veteran coach Brad Gilbert told CNN\u2019s Don Riddell earlier this week. \u201cHaving that motivation to want to go to practice and want to work hard for somebody, that will help. And I think that\u2019s one thing that Andy can provide.\u201d\n\nDjokovic himself has said how he \u201ccaught (Murray) a little bit off guard\u201d with the coaching offer, but remains confident that the unlikely collaboration will bear fruit.\n\n\u201cBeing on the same side of the net is actually great for a change,\u201d he explained last month. \u201cHe\u2019s been one of my greatest rivals and, in a way, it was strange for me to share all these insights about how I feel on the court, sharing some of the secrets of what I\u2019m going through, what I\u2019m thinking about, how I see my game with somebody that has been always one of the top rivals.\n\n\u201cHe has a unique perspective on my game as one of the greatest rivals that I\u2019ve had. He knows the pros and cons of my game and he has also played up to recently on the tour, so he knows all the other best players currently in the world \u2013 the youngsters and their weaknesses and strengths in their games. I look forward to it, I really do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a surreal twist of fate to see Murray and Djokovic hitting together on practice courts at the Australian Open, 14 years after they first faced each other in a major final at the same tournament.\n\nIt was Djokovic who triumphed on that occasion, claiming his second grand slam crown in Melbourne. Few could have predicted what would follow: eight further Australian Open titles, a record 428 weeks at the top of the rankings, and a career like none we have seen before.\n\nMurray and Djokovic embrace after the 2011 Australian Open final. Robert Prezioso/Getty Images/File\n\nIn virtually every category for men\u2019s tennis \u2013 grand slams, Masters titles, time spent as world No. 1 \u2013 Djokovic is unmatched. With nothing left to prove, he still feels compelled to accomplish more, to extend further the boundaries of what it is possible to achieve in a single career.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really see what the 25th title would change,\u201d said Ozmo, adding: \u201cFor me, undoubtedly, he\u2019s the greatest of all time. I think even people who used to say, \u2018It\u2019s a fight, it\u2019s close\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re giving up too.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just making up goals now and he\u2019s setting up new goals just to try to keep himself motivated.\u201d\n\nFor Wilander, the debate about the greatest of all time is purely a matter of taste and semantics; but when it boils down to results \u2013 the player who has achieved the most on the court \u2013 in his mind there is no debate left to be had.\n\n\u201cThe greatest could be Roger Federer, it could be Bj\u00f6rn Borg, it could be anyone, but the best of all time is Novak Djokovic, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Wilander. \u201cThere is no question in anybody\u2019s mind that he is the best ever.\u201d\n\nThe next two weeks in Melbourne are another opportunity to find out what this extraordinary athlete can still achieve.",

It then flies west over the Andes to Santiago, the Chilean capital, which sits in a valley surrounded by the snowy Andean peaks and the Chilean Coastal Range.\n\nLast year is now officially the hottest year on record, with scientific analyses saying that is playing a role in recent extreme weather events, with the LA wildfires being the latest example. (Find out here how you can help residents affected by the unprecedented fires).\n\nRising temperatures might also contribute to an increase in severe \u201cclear air\u201d turbulence, which strikes fast and offers no visual cues. While incidents are predicted to rise, experts say it doesn\u2019t mean flying will be less safe.\n\nPeople and planes\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of travel-based misbehavior this month already, with a JetBlue passenger arrested for opening the emergency exit door on a plane, a man caught with a crocodile skull in his luggage in Delhi and a woman stopped in Germany with 90 kilos (nearly 200 pounds) of luxury chocolate from Dubai.

In December, a United Airlines pilot raced through a Texas airport to surprise an old friend: the woman who saved his life.\n\nAnd in October, a Delta Air Lines crew \u2013 and a plane full of well-wishing passengers \u2013 helped reunite a mother and daughter for a precious final goodbye. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt wasn\u2019t one person who did one huge thing, it was a lot of people doing a really nice thing,\u201d says daughter Hannah White.\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nPlenty of idyllically located Italian villages with aging populations have been making headlines in recent years, most often for the boom in one-euro homes.\n\nNow a little town in the southern region of Calabria has taken the unusual step of banning its residents from falling ill. It\u2019s home to a beautiful hilltop castle, but its mayor says its health-care facilities are less of an attraction.\n\nBecoming sick at sea is another hazard few think about in advance. CNN Travel took a look at the life of a cruise ship doctor, from heart attacks to dealing with death.\n\nIn Germany, doctors can prescribe four-week spa breaks to frazzled parents.

Jeenah Moon/Reuters\n\nOn Saturday, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger invited President-elect Donald Trump to visit the region and see firsthand the damage inflicted by multiple catastrophic wildfires since Jan. 7.\n\nOfficials have confirmed at least 16 deaths from the devastation, with the ongoing Eaton, Hurst, Kenneth and Palisades fires spreading to more than 38,000 acres combined. The overall death toll, however, remains unclear \u2014 many areas are still unable to be searched by emergency personnel.\n\nThe invitation comes on the heels of California Gov.

            "title": "Some California residents get extra protection from wildfires \u2013 for a price",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs the Palisades fire began intensifying Tuesday evening, Los Angeles real estate executive Keith Wasserman sent out a plea on social media: \u201cDoes anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home in Pacific Palisades? Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount.\u201d\n\nThe now-deleted post sparked an intense blowback by social media users who felt the wealthy shouldn\u2019t be given special attention during an emergency.\n\n\u201cWhose home gets saved shouldn\u2019t depend on their bank account,\u201d one TikTok user commented.\n\nAs multiple wildfires, powered by high-speed winds, have destroyed thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area, some residents have gone to great lengths \u2014 and often great expense \u2014 to try to shield their homes from destruction. Some have paid thousands of dollars to get their properties sprayed with fire-retardant gels to stem the damage, while others have invested in personal fire hydrants to help fight fires near their property.\n\nDespite the intense reaction to Wasserman\u2019s social media post, most private firefighters aren\u2019t hired by wealthy individuals, Mike Stutts, a firefighter in Somerset, California, told CNN. Instead, most work with home insurance companies that are trying to save expensive homes to avoid costly insurance payouts.\n\nAccording to materials on its website, insurance company Chubb offers \u201cWildfire Defense Services\u201d to eligible clients. During a wildfire event, those services include \u201csending certified professional firefighters to your home,\u201d \u201cremoving combustible materials from around your home\u201d and \u201cspraying your home with a heat-absorbing fire-blocking gel.\u201d\n\nTim Bauer, a senior vice president at fire damage restoration service Allied Disaster Defense, said after the first three days of fire in Pacific Palisades, he had a waiting list of at least 200 people, all desperate for the company\u2019s services. Bauer said the company is spraying properties with the same fire retardant dropped by firefighting air tankers.\n\nAllied sprays down bushes, shrubs and other vegetation to prevent ashes and sparks from igniting a home.\n\nDuring non-emergency times, the cost is about $1,000, but amid dangerous wildfire conditions, Bauer charges $5,000.\n\nFor many in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, it\u2019s a small price to pay to help protect multimillion-dollar homes. Bauer said one woman offered $100,000 to be moved to the top of his waiting list, but Bauer said he planned to stick to the original order on his list.\n\nOn Friday, Michael Owens, a real estate developer in the Los Angeles area, showed one of his newly built homes to a family whose own home was just destroyed in the Palisades fire.\n\nThe listed price of the home in Westlake Village, which sits on the Los Angeles-Ventura county line, is nearly $15 million. One of the home\u2019s main selling points is it\u2019s built with fire-proof materials and comes equipped with a personal fire hydrant.\n\nAll in, the cost of the home\u2019s personal fire hydrant is about $100,000, Owens told CNN. That includes the installation cost and a one-time $35,000 fee to the municipal water company for access. Owens said he has one in front of his own Westlake Village home, as well.\n\nOwens said he hoped the recent wildfires would convince more people to prioritize investing in fire-safe homes.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting now, as you see homes built back in the Palisades, what people consider doing with their homes when they\u2019re in an urban high-fire risk area,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Malibu, a type of personal fire hydrant that costs significantly less than $100,000 has grown in popularity, said Kevin Rosenbloom, a local resident who owns a healthcare device company.\n\nRosenbloom\u2019s home was rebuilt after it was destroyed by a wildfire in 2007. In front of his home, he built a \u201cHainy Hydrant,\u201d a personal fire hydrant developed by fellow Malibu resident Matt Haines to help the area combat wildfires.\n\nRosenbloom said the hydrant cost him about $2,500, and since it taps into a home\u2019s personal water supply, it can be installed by a plumber. Rosenbloom said his home hasn\u2019t been hit by the recent fires, but he plans to use his personal hydrant to keep his home \u201ccool and wet\u201d if one approaches.\n\n\u201cPeople all over Malibu have been putting these hydrants in. It\u2019s a basic first step and it\u2019s very inexpensive relative to other systems available,\u201d Rosenbloom said. \u201cThis is really the next technology in fire suppression and fire protection.\u201d\n\nEven with extra investment in firefighting and suppression systems, though, there is no guarantee a home could survive a fire as strong as the one still raging in Pacific Palisades.\n\nWasserman, who sent out the plea for private firefighters, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.",

He died trying to fight the blaze that consumed his home of more than 50 years.\n\nAnother victim, an 85-year-old woman, refused to leave her home as the fast-moving Palisades Fire approached, preferring instead to stay behind with her beloved pets. A former child star from Australia also was among those who died, as well as a Malibu resident and surfer who was called a \u201cmagnet for people.\u201d\n\nFive of the 11 deaths appear related to the Palisades Fire near the Southern California coast, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Another six deaths have been attributed to the Eaton Fire, which raged east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe complete death toll won\u2019t be clear until it\u2019s safe for investigators to enter neighborhoods where there are downed power lines, gas leaks and other hazards, according to authorities.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the victims:\n\nAnnette Rossilli\n\nAnnette Rossilli Luxe Homecare\n\nAnnette Rossilli, 85, insisted on staying in her Pacific Palisades home with her dog Greetly, her canary Pepper, her two parrots and her turtle, according to Luxe Homecare, the company that provided in-home care for her three days a week.\n\nThe Palisades Fire, the largest of several blazes, started Tuesday morning. Rossilli was encouraged to leave on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA caregiver later offered to pick Rossilli up even though it was her day off, Fay Vahdani, Luxe Homecare president, said Friday. Neighbors tried to convince her to evacuate but Rossilli refused to leave.\n\nOn Wednesday, firefighters found Rossilli\u2019s body in her car, according to Vahdani and relatives of the victim.\n\nRossilli is survived by a daughter and a son. She ran a plumbing business in Pacific Palisades for many years with her late husband. She continued to live in the same home after his passing.\n\nShe was a kind, friendly and grateful person who had many friends in the community and will be deeply missed, according to Luxe Homecare.\n\nAnthony and Justin Mitchell\n\nAnthony Mitchell, an amputee who used a wheelchair, last spoke to his daughter, Hajime White, who lives in Arkansas, on Wednesday morning, she told the Washington Post.\n\nHe told his daughter he planned to evacuate his home in Altadena, a neighborhood north of Pasadena, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nMitchell and his adult son Justin, who had cerebral palsy, lived together, White told the newspaper.\n\nThey never evacuated: White said authorities told her Mitchell\u2019s body was found by the bed of his son.\n\n\u201cHe was not going to leave his son behind. No matter what,\u201d White told the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s like a ton of bricks just fell on me.\u201d\n\nErliene Kelley\n\nErliene Kelley Family photo\n\nErliene Kelley chose not to evacuate on Tuesday night with her granddaughter and her family. She wanted to stay in the Altadena home where she\u2019d lived for more than 40 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in God\u2019s hands,\u201d Kelley told family members, according to her granddaughter, Briana Navarro.\n\nNavarro wrote in a GoFundMe post that the family was notified on Friday that Kelley had perished in the Eaton Fire.\n\n\u201cWe made the choice to evacuate on Tuesday night, however my grandmother decided she wanted to stay,\u201d wrote Navarro. She later asked her father to check on Kelley, who again refused to evacuate.\n\nNavarro\u2019s father returned to the house on Wednesday and found it had been destroyed in the fire.\n\nNavarro, her husband and their two children lived with Kelley. They lost everything in the fire, according to the post.\n\nVictor Shaw\n\nVictor Shaw Family photo via KTLA\n\nVictor Shaw, 66, decided to try to fight the raging Eaton blaze with a garden hose this week rather than evacuate his longtime family home, according to KTLA.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner has confirmed his death, noting that died at his home from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.\n\nShaw lived with his younger sister, Shari Shaw, who told KTLA the intensity of the approaching fire forced her to evacuate Tuesday night but that her brother insisted on staying.\n\nRodney Nickerson\n\nRodney Nickerson Eric Nickerson\n\nIn one of his final phone calls, as the Eaton Fire approached his Altadena home, Rodney Nickerson said, \u201cSon, the winds are picking up really, really bad.\u201d\n\nThe son, Eric Nickerson, remembers every word of that last conversation with his father. They were extremely close and spoke every day.\n\n\u201cIt was a normal conversation. Like most mornings,\u201d Eric Nickerson told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Friday.\n\nThe younger Nickerson recalled not being able to reach his father later that Tuesday, nor the following morning.\n\nAfter other family members and friends learned of Rodney\u2019s death, they struggled to break the news to his son.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what to tell me,\u201d Eric Nickerson said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really know what words to tell me because of the situation.\u201d\n\nThe close-knit, working class neighborhood where Rodney Nickerson lived for more than 50 years \u2013 and where his son grew up \u2013 has been virtually destroyed by fire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastated,\u201d Eric Nickerson lamented. \u201cIt looks like a movie set.\u201d\n\nRory Callum Sykes\n\nRory Callum Sykes was killed in the California wildfires, according to his mother Shelley Sykes. From Shelley Sykes/X\n\nA former child star from Australia died when the Los Angeles wildfires ripped through his family\u2019s Malibu estate in California earlier this week, according to his mother.\n\nRory Callum Sykes was at the family\u2019s 17-acre Mount Malibu TV Studios estate, where he had his own cottage, when it burned down during the Palisades Fire on January 8, his mother Shelley Sykes wrote on X Thursday.\n\nShelley Sykes described her son, who appeared on the 1998 British TV series \u201cKiddy Kapers,\u201d as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cwonderful\u201d and said she was \u201ctotally heart broken\u201d by his death.\n\nShe said she had tried to put out the wildfire cinders on her property\u2019s roof using a hose but couldn\u2019t because the water wasn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018mom leave me\u2019 and no mom can leave their kid. And I\u2019ve got a broken arm, I couldn\u2019t lift him, I couldn\u2019t move him,\u201d Sykes told Australia\u2019s 10 News First.\n\nHer son, 32, was born blind with cerebral palsy and had become famous for his speeches on overcoming disability. He was the co-founder of Happy Charity, which according to its site offers, \u201cHope, Happiness & Health to those that are Hurting.\u201d\n\nOn his website, Sykes described himself as a professional speaker and consultant for many companies including the Tony Robbins Foundation and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance.\n\n\u201cHe overcame so much with surgeries and therapies to regain his sight and to be able to learn to walk. Despite the pain, he still enthused about traveling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica,\u201d Shelley Sykes wrote on X.\n\nRandall \u201cRandy\u201d Miod\n\nCarol Smith with son Randall Miod Carol Smith\n\nRandall \u201cRandy\u201d Miod, 55, died in the place he loved most: his home.\n\nThat\u2019s according to his mother, Carol Smith, who said Miod lived in the Malibu beach house for decades.\n\nDetectives found human remains in Miod\u2019s home, Smith said, telling CNN all his roommates have been accounted for.\n\n\u201c(His home) was his prized possession. That\u2019s the one and only house he ever owned,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe just felt so blessed to be able to live in Malibu. That was his dream come true because he\u2019d been surfing since he was a teenager.\u201d\n\nAbout 30 years ago, Miod rented a studio apartment attached to the house. After 13 years, the owner offered to sell the house for a discounted price \u2013 an opportunity Miod jumped on.\n\nFrom there, the house on Pacific Coast Highway became locally known as \u201cthe Crab Shack,\u201d Smith said. Miod had an open-door policy in which friends were constantly coming and going from the red barn-style home built in 1924, she said.\n\n\u201cHe was just kind of a magnet for people. And people just loved him and he loved people. He was a very kind person,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere was always a party, wherever Randy went, there was a party.\u201d\n\nMiod was determined to protect his beloved house.\n\nWhen they talked on the phone Tuesday, he told Smith he had a garden hose ready to go. She believed he didn\u2019t know how big the flames were going to get.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been through so many of these fires and made it through unscathed. I think he thought he could do it again,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m realizing how many memories he had in that home, I can understand why he didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d\n\nMiod, who lived in California all his life, spent most of the last few decades managing restaurants and surfing.\n\n\u201cHe used to cut class in high school to go surfing. I can remember one time I had to hide his surfboard,\u201d Smith laughed. \u201cI said, \u2018You are supposed to be in the school. You\u2019re not supposed to be at the beach.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said the last year was a tough one for Miod, as he lost his restaurant job, broke a finger and had to say goodbye to his cat of many years. However, Smith said he always kept a positive outlook on life and searched for the silver lining despite the hardship. He even recently picked up a new kitten.\n\n\u201cHe was unique\u2026 I\u2019ve never known another one like him,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

CNN is tracking the fires in maps and charts.\n\nThis map will automatically update as data becomes available.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection employs sensors attached to aircraft to capture fire perimeter data. Because high winds can sometimes ground aircraft, updates to the observed fire perimeter can be delayed.\n\nTrack the fire size and containment estimates on the fires currently burning throughout the state:\n\nCalifornia officials continue updating the areas impacted by evacuation orders and warnings. The map below will refresh automatically as new information becomes available.\n\nEvaluating the damage\n\nMaxar satellite imagery showing Altadena, California, was analyzed by Microsoft\u2019s AI for Good and shows the alarming damage to structures in the area.\n\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires have already climbed to the top of the list of most destructive fires in LA County history, and currently sit in the No. 3 and No. 4 slots on the list of most destructive wildfires in the entire state of California\u2019s history, since at least 1991.\n\nFirefighters have been able to stop significant growth of the Eaton Fire, but it has already burned about 14,000 acres.\n\nSee satellite images, from Maxar, of a neighborhood in Altadena before and after the Eaton Fire ravaged the area.\n\nSatellite image \u00a92025 Maxar Technologies Satellite image \u00a92025 Maxar Technologies Destroyed structures in Altadena, California Satellite image \u00a92025 Maxar Technologies\n\nThe Palisades Fire has spread at an alarming rate, burning more than 20,000 acres by Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires have each destroyed more than 5,000 structures, according to Cal Fire, totaling at least 10,000 destroyed structures between the two largest active fires.\n\nMore context\n\nSince October, Southern California has experienced increasing dryness, as fall and winter storms focused on the Pacific Northwest. Last winter brought abundant rain and snow to the Southwest, but this winter has taken a starkly different turn.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCaroline Darian, the daughter of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot who sustained years of horrific sexual abuse by her then-husband and other men, has described how she\u2019s certain her father drugged her and strongly suspects she was raped too.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Darian, aged 46, described the mental \u201cburden\u201d of being the daughter of both victim and perpetrator, as she expressed her strong desire for her father to die in prison.\n\nA horrifying, monthslong mass rape and drugging trial that shook France to its core concluded last month, with 51 guilty verdicts. Dominique Pelicot and 49 others were found guilty of the rape or sexual assault of his former wife, while one of those on trial was convicted of the attempted and aggravated rape of his own wife, rather than Gis\u00e8le, having copied Pelicot\u2019s methods.\n\nThe trial \u2013 which has pushed the country to examine a culture struggling with pervasive misogyny and systemic sexual assault \u2013 has galvanized women to demand changes in the way it approaches gender-based violence.\n\nDarian described receiving a fateful phone call from her mother, one evening in November 2020, in which Gis\u00e8le informed her that her father, now 72, had been drugging Gis\u00e8le for around 10 years in order to facilitate her rape by different men.\n\n\u201cAt that moment, I lost what was a normal life,\u201d Darian told the broadcaster.\n\nDarian spoke of how she strongly suspects that she was also a victim of sexual abuse orchestrated by her father. Days after the phone call, Darian herself was called by police and shown images found on Dominique\u2019s laptop of herself lying unconscious on a bed wearing only a T-shirt and underwear \u2013 images she didn\u2019t immediately recognize herself in.\n\nShe told the BBC she knows her father drugged her, and surmises she was raped too. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any evidence,\u201d she laments.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the case for how many victims? They are not believed because there\u2019s no evidence. They\u2019re not listened to, not supported.\u201d\n\nIn court, Dominique maintained he had not abused his daughter. Earlier that day, Darian screamed at him: \u201cI\u2019ll never see you again! You\u2019ll die alone like a dog!,\u201d according to media reports.\n\nThis courtroom sketch depicts Dominique Pelicot at the courthouse in Avignon, France, on September 11. ZZIIGG/Reuters\n\nNow, she describes her father as \u201cone of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 or 30 years\u201d and has written a book detailing her family\u2019s trauma, titled \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again.\u201d\n\nShe described the reality she is faced with as a \u201cterrible burden\u201d and can now only view Dominique as the \u201csexual criminal he is.\u201d\n\nThe book also explores the concept of \u201cchemical submission\u201d \u2013 the use of drugs to facilitate criminal action against a person, including sexual abuse. It was the method Dominique used to orchestrate his wife\u2019s abuse, offering her unconscious body to strangers online.\n\nIn December, Dominique received the maximum sentence of 20 years for aggravated rape. Forty-eight other men on trial were found guilty of aggravated rape, with two guilty of sexual assault.\n\nEvidence shows how Dominique recruited the men to rape his then-wife on the now-defunct Coco.fr \u201cdating site\u201d for years, using the chatroom called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d where he would exchange pictures of an unconscious Gis\u00e8le before moving to Skype and text messages to arrange the meeting with his accomplices.\n\nGis\u00e8le testified that she was completely unaware of her husband\u2019s actions. Over time, the frequent sedation and sexual abuse began to take a physical toll. Her husband accompanied her on several doctor\u2019s visits during which she complained about memory loss and pelvic pain, according to court documents.\n\nIt was only after Dominique was arrested in a local supermarket in September 2020 for filming up the skirts of female customers, for which he was convicted, that his web of crimes came to light. Pelicot received an eight-month suspended prison sentence for this offense.\n\nWhilst investigating the upskirting, police officers confiscated his hard drive, laptop and phones and found hundreds of images and videos of Gis\u00e8le being raped, opening one of the worst sex offense cases in modern French history.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department effective Friday, according to a court filing.\n\nThe filing comes amid a legal fight to stop Attorney General Merrick Garland from releasing the special counsel\u2019s report of his investigations into then-President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the alleged mishandling of classified documents after Trump left office.\n\nSmith gave his final, two-volume report to the attorney general on Tuesday. Garland has indicated he would not release the part of the report regarding the classified documents investigation, but believes it should be public eventually.\n\nSmith\u2019s office has been in the wind-down process for weeks, and his resignation before Trump takes office isn\u2019t unexpected. In addition to finalizing its report and sending it to the attorney general, Smith\u2019s team had also handed off an ongoing appeal over the special counsel\u2019s office powers to other attorneys at the Department of Justice and dismissed the two federal criminal cases against Trump because of his return to the presidency.\n\nThe attorney general has also told congressional committee leaders he intends to give to them confidential access to Smith\u2019s volume on the classified documents case \u2014 making this weekend and next week a crucial window for AG Merrick Garland\u2019s intentions of transparency.\n\nIn the meantime, the Justice Department is battling in court with Trump and his former co-defendants over whether Smith\u2019s report can be made public, with the clock ticking down to the the January 20 inauguration. Trump is planning to appoint some members of his defense team, who have argued in court against publication, to high-level positions at the Justice Department.\n\nAn appeals court on Friday rejected a request from Trump and his allies to keep the report under wraps. The Justice Department has since appealed a temporary hold that Judge Aileen Cannon placed on the report\u2019s release, and the former defendants have asked her to extend that hold, which otherwise expires Sunday evening.\n\nAs the court fight stands now, the Justice Department may be able to release Smith\u2019s first volume to the public Sunday or Monday. Cannon, however, has asked for more information from the Justice Department by Sunday morning about what\u2019s in Volume 1 and whether any of it bears on the classified documents case.\n\nSmith was appointed by Garland to take over the documents and election subversion investigations in November 2022, after Trump announced his campaign for reelection. A former federal prosecutor, Smith had more recently served as a war crimes prosecutor at the Hague.\n\nHe brought charges against Trump in both investigations in 2023, but both prosecutions ran into legal setbacks, and with voters\u2019 decision to return Trump to the White House, the president-elect was dismissed from the cases.\n\nOne legacy from Smith\u2019s investigations is the sweeping presidential immunity ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in the election subversion case, which set a very high bar for prosecuting a former president for his official acts in office.\n\nTrump and his allies on the Hill have publicly discussed investigations they intend to launch into the special counsel probes.\n\nThe report potentially acts as Smith\u2019s final word on what his investigations found, and their legal reasoning. The current court fight aside, there are other avenues by which the report might become public. Congress could take steps to obtain the report or information from it. There is also the possibility of Freedom of Information Acts requests, and litigation stemming from those requests, forcing the disclosure of details from the report.\n\nTrump\u2019s former co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos DeOliveira, are arguing that the report should not be shared with Congress or the public because it would be prejudicial in the event that the prosecution against them \u2014 dismissed by Judge Cannon on the grounds that Smith was unconstitutionally appointed \u2014 was revived by an appeals court.\n\nThe new filing from DOJ countered that argument by pointing to Garland\u2019s decision not to publicly release that report and by noting that the lawmakers that would be allowed to view it, under Garland\u2019s plan, would be prohibited from sharing details from it.\n\nTrump and his allies are also arguing that Cannon\u2019s ruling disqualifying Smith deprived him of the power to write the report and prevents Garland from releasing it.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

            "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nIn the wee hours of an October morning, dozens of dogs chased the hulking figure of an animal scrambling through a forest in northwestern China as a thermal drone whizzed overhead.\n\n\u201cThe dogs caught it! Just stab it! Stab it!\u201d a drone operator shouted into his walkie-talkie to the hunter, in a video report by a state-linked news outlet.\n\nThe hunter rushed to the spot where the dogs had cornered the 125-kilogram beast, and thrust his spear into it, killing the animal and securing a reward of 2,400 yuan ($330).\n\nHe works with one of six \u201cbounty hunting\u201d teams hired by Xiji county in China\u2019s northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region this fall.\n\nTheir prey? Wild boars.\n\nIn recent years, China has authorized teams of bounty hunters to kill wild boars as part of a pilot program to control a pest that\u2019s wreaking havoc on crops and causing accidents, injuries, and even fatalities. In February, the program was expanded to a nationwide cull.\n\nThe hunters are not allowed to use firearms or poison, but the cull has surprised the public in a country where wildlife protection is tightly regulated.\n\nAnimal protection groups have criticized the measure as experts debate whether the rise in wild boar attacks justifies killing large numbers of animals, and if hunting is the right solution to mitigate human-wildlife conflict in the world\u2019s second most populous country.\n\nWild boar attacks\n\nChina\u2019s problem with wild boars dates back over two decades, when people hunted so many of the animals to eat that they became extinct in some areas, according to the state broadcaster CGTN.\n\nIn response, the government added them to a national protection list in 2000, allowing licensed hunting only in areas where there were too many boars.\n\nOver time, almost free from natural predators, the animal\u2019s population surged from some 10,000 to about 2 million, and so did reports of wild boar attacks.\n\nBoars caused damage to property or people in all but eight of China\u2019s 34 provincial-level regions, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) said last January.\n\nIn Xiji county, where six official bounty hunting teams killed 300 wild boars this fall, the animals inflicted economic losses of over 2 million yuan ($276,200) in 2023 alone, mainly through tearing up farmland, a local official told The Paper, a state-run newspaper.\n\nA cornfield devastated by wild boars in central Henan province. @xiangru/Douyin\n\nPeople have also lost their lives.\n\nIn December 2023, a 51-year-old villager from central Hubei province died from blood loss after being bitten by a wild boar, The Paper reported. Three years earlier, a village official suffered a similar fatal boar attack in southwestern Sichuan province, according to the newspaper.\n\nBoars have also been seen in urban areas more frequently as their numbers rise and habitat shrinks from China\u2019s rapid urbanization.\n\nA wild boar bursts into a four-star hotel in eastern Nanjing city. @diyiqiumipangge/Weibo\n\nA wild boar burst into the lobby of a four-star hotel in Nanjing in late October, struggling to escape on the slick floor before security captured it, according to state media reports.\n\nTwo days earlier, another boar, weighing 80 kilograms, ran amok through a downtown street in eastern Hangzhou, overturning vehicles and rampaging in a local shop.\n\nA boar charges down a downtown street in eastern Hangzhou city. @pengpaichunqiu/Weibo\n\nIs \u201chunting\u201d the right solution?\n\nWild boar hunting\u2019s popularity plummeted after the species came under national protection, though some poachers still risked jail time to kill them for sale in wildlife markets.\n\nBut demand for boar meat slumped when Beijing imposed what it called an \u201cunprecedentedly strict\u201d ban on wildlife consumption in early 2020.\n\nAt the time, the coronavirus pandemic was spreading worldwide and many scientists linked it back to a food market in central China that sold wild meat.\n\nOne year after the consumption ban, reports of wild boar attacks exceeded 100 for the first time, according to a tally of human-boar conflicts from 2000 to 2021 published in Acta Geographica Sinica, a leading Chinese geographic journal.\n\nAs social and state media reports of wild boar attacks continued to mount, the central government removed the species from its national protection list in 2023, waiving the need for a license to hunt them.\n\nWhile many welcomed the policy shift to control the pest, recent high-profile bounty hunting initiatives by local authorities have faced some pushback, igniting debate among experts about how the country should tackle this growing public menace.\n\nA screengrab from thermal drone footage posted by a bounty hunting team in Ningxia, showing dogs cornering a boar, with a hunter (lower right) approaching. @Chengshilierenquanshe/Douyin\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to protect animals? Why are we back to hunting again?\u201d said a user on Douyin, TikTok\u2019s sister app in China.\n\nAn animal protection group active in fighting wildlife poaching for over a decade called the nationwide culling a \u201cbrutal farce,\u201d on China\u2019s X-like platform Weibo.\n\nOfficials have defended the policy. Sun Quanhui, a member of the Wild Boar Population Management Expert Group at China\u2019s top forestry administration, told the state-run China Daily that hunting was the \u201conly way\u201d to manage the wild boar population, given the absence of natural predators.\n\nYet, Zhou Jinfeng, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, a Beijing-based conservation organization, told CNN that hunting, as a form of human intervention, is only justifiable when the animal\u2019s population truly overwhelms the local ecology.\n\nAnd based on open data, he said, it was way too early to say the boars were \u201crunning rampant\u201d in China.\n\nHe added that wild boar attacks are \u201cprecisely a fallout of humans disrupting the natural balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn one hand, we\u2019ve driven their natural predators, like tigers, to the brink of extinction. On the other, while we\u2019re becoming more aware of the need for conservation, many of our efforts are one-sided.\u201d\n\nAmong those who agree on the need to curb the wild boar population, opinions vary on how to cull them and what to do with the carcasses.\n\nMembers of the state-backed expert group suggested hunters should be allowed to use guns to improve hunting efficiency, as reported by The Paper.\n\nThey also proposed changing China\u2019s laws to allow people to consume \u201ccaptured wild boars,\u201d but only after a quarantine process to ensure the meat is safe to eat. However, the group didn\u2019t provide further details on how this would work.\n\nBoth proposals have raised safety concerns among experts outside the group.\n\nChina\u2019s top forestry authority said it was working to \u201coptimize firearms and ammunition management\u201d to \u201cfacilitate professional hunting,\u201d according to the state-owned People\u2019s Daily.\n\nCNN reached out to the authority for more details on possible use of firearms and a response to the advice to legalize the consumption of wild boars.\n\n\u201cWild boar damage has become a disaster\u2026 which actually reflects a certain imbalance in the ecological environment,\u201d the deputy head of the expert group told CCTV.\n\n\u201cTherefore, no matter what methods we use, we ultimately need to restore the flow and balance of the ecological chain to achieve true harmony between humans and nature.\u201d",

Incoming Trump, meanwhile, has warned that \u201call hell will break out\u201d if the hostages are not released by his inauguration on January 20.\n\nHowever, the official cautioned that gaps still remain between the parties and the ability to close those gaps is not yet guaranteed.\n\n\u2018Historic opportunity\u2019\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum welcomed the decision to send the Israeli delegation, describing the move as \u201ca historic opportunity to secure the release of all our loved ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave no stone unturned and return with an agreement that ensures the return of all hostages, down to the last one,\u201d the forum said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe optimism comes even as Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza continues to rage, with the IDF on Saturday announcing the deaths of four soldiers in combat in the north of the enclave.\n\nIsrael launched the war in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, that killed more than 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage. Since then, at least 46,537 Palestinians have been killed and more than 109,571 people injured, according to health authorities in Gaza.\n\nWhile dozens of hostages were released as part of a short-lived hostages-for-ceasefire deal in November 2023, the Israeli government believes 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza \u2013 nearly all of whom were taken on October 7, 2023, and dozens of whom are believed to be dead.\n\nGrowing frustration over the lack of progress since the 2023 deal has seen protesters regularly take to the streets in Israel.\n\nOn Saturday, protests took place in several locations, including Tel Aviv, where some demonstrators marched through the city center with signs calling for the end of the war and saying \u201cweak leaders wage pointless wars.\u201d\n\n\u2018A deal now!\u2019\n\nAt the weekly rally at Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, Shira Albag \u2013 whose 19-year-old daughter Liri Albag appeared in a recent \u201cproof of life\u201d hostage video released by Hamas \u2013 demanded an immediate deal as she addressed the crowd.\n\n\u201cI stand here, exactly one week after receiving proof of life from my Liri, and my heart just wants to scream. Liri, our light, just 19 years old \u2013 a child with her whole life ahead of her \u2013 is there, in captivity, in hell,\u201d Albag said.\n\n\u201cA deal now!\u201d she demanded, adding, \u201cLiri is alive, and she will return home alive!\u201d\n\nUS Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew and UK Ambassador to Israel Simon Walters also addressed the crowd.\n\n\u201cTonight, as Israel\u2019s close friends and allies, we reaffirm our commitment to helping reach a breakthrough that will bring the hostages home and bring a better future for the people of this region,\u201d Lew said.\n\nWalters added: \u201cHamas bears full responsibility for these crimes. But practically, we know that the only way to bring all the hostages home is through negotiation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the mother and father of Itay Chen, one of the seven dual US-Israeli citizens still held by Hamas, visited Qatar in person this week to speak with negotiators.\n\nChen is dead but his body has not been recovered or returned.\n\n\u201cWe went to Qatar because we don\u2019t have full confidence in our representatives in the negotiations and wished to convey the families\u2019 position to the US and Qatar facilitators,\u201d Ruby Chen told CNN on Saturday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.",

Two people survived.\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s transport ministry said Saturday that both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) from the Boeing 737-800 had stopped working about four minutes before the crash.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry said it was unclear why the devices stopped recording, adding that it will work to determine the cause.\n\n\u201cCVR and FDR data are important data for accident investigations, but accident investigations are conducted through investigation and analysis of various data, so we plan to do our best to accurately identify the cause of the accident,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nThe flight data recorder of Jeju Air flight 7C 2216.

Many airports don\u2019t have similar structures so close to runways, according to aviation experts.\n\nSouth Korean police last week also raided Jeju Air\u2019s office in Seoul and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of their investigation, Reuters reported.",

He proposed, but she declined. After a serious injury, her leg had been amputated; she worried about being a burden as a wife.\n\n\u201cI realized that before amputation, I was more attractive. I was not sure that I could find a way to fulfil my family role as a woman,\u201d said Tsymbaliuk. It took her a long time to regain her confidence.\n\nTsymbaliuk says she was one of the first Ukrainian military amputees following the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Almost three years on, nearly 370,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been wounded. Thousands have lost one or more limbs.\n\nWhile the government does not provide official figures on amputations, a state program issued prostheses to almost 20,000 people across 2023 and the first half of 2024, and many others were helped by private programs in Ukraine and abroad.\n\nIn the past two years, Ukraine has implemented protocols for physical and, to some degree, psychological rehabilitation for those injured in conflict. But sexual rehabilitation for people who have lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries has been largely overlooked.\n\nSex has long been a taboo topic in Ukraine. While modern Ukrainians are more open about sex than in the Soviet era, the topic is still an uncomfortable one for many.\n\n\u201cIn our culture, we don\u2019t really have a habit of talking about sex. Not all people can even say this word calmly. It is generally not acceptable to tell a stranger or even a partner about your sex issues,\u201d military psychologist and sexologist Hanna Revunets told CNN, adding that men or women who have lost limbs because of the war rarely ask for help regarding such a sensitive subject.\n\n\u201cIf I ask veterans about sex issues, they usually say that everything is okay. Only a few of them after a while, when they start to trust me, can talk about the problems they have,\u201d Revunets said.\n\nCombat medic Tetyana Tsymbaliuk suffered a serious injury requiring amputation in May 2022, soon after the Russian invasion. She has undergone a long rehabilitation process and, last year, had a baby. Kostiantyn and Vlada Liberovy/Superhumans Center\n\nThere are no protocols or recommendations for sexual rehabilitation on the official governmental level, she said, or even any mention of it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important because the doctor is required to work according to protocol,\u201d Revunets said. \u201cSexual rehabilitation is not specified anywhere, so the doctor can only take the initiative if he or she wants to do so. But most doctors aren\u2019t ready to talk about it.\u201d\n\nIt takes time even to persuade some doctors of its significance, Revunets said. \u201cWhen I tell my colleagues about the importance of sexual rehabilitation, they look at me as if I\u2019m crazy, (someone) who doesn\u2019t understand what kind of serious injuries the patient has,\u201d she said.\n\nA good sexologist can help in many ways. Revunets is one of the very few sexologists in the country who works with the military. \u201cI find out what exactly is wrong with the patient. I ask how the person feels. Depending on this, I give advice - it can be advice on how and what to do from a technical point of view, or what medications to take, or help psychologically.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was told to have sex, but no one told me how\u2019\n\nThe war has resulted in an unprecedented number of people with injuries, a situation for which Ukraine was unprepared. The lack of any information on sexual rehabilitation has motivated the Ukrainian nonprofit Veteran Hub, which is specifically dedicated to supporting war veterans and their families, to study the topic.\n\nIn 2023, Veteran Hub researchers conducted 39 in-depth interviews with injured soldiers and their partners. Among other things, interviewees spoke anonymously about their sex lives after injury.\n\nResearchers found that sex itself had changed for many. For example, after being injured, some respondents started to prepare for or plan sexual relations due to physical changes.\n\nOne of the veterans in a long-term relationship said of the doctors who treated him: \u201cI was told to have sex, but no one told me how. If we\u2019re talking about the technical part, it is very important.\u201d He told researchers that without formal resources available to them, men were having to pass on information \u201cby word of mouth.\u201d\n\nIn response to the researchers\u2019 findings, Veteran Hub created a guide for veterans on how to restore their sexual lives after being wounded.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there was a great demand for this topic. After physical rehabilitation, people start asking themselves whether they will be able to swim in the sea, go skiing, go on dates, or have sex. And usually no one can answer these questions,\u201d said Veteran Hub project manager Kateryna Skorohod.\n\nOlga Serdyuk, the head of a sexual educational program at a network of rehabilitation centers called Recovery, said: \u201cWe need to understand that a wounded person works with different specialists - surgeons, physiotherapists, psychologists - on the way to rehabilitation. Because there is a lack of sexologists in Ukraine, those doctors must be ready for the person to open up to them and talk about sexual rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nTo help widen their knowledge, Recovery launched a course called \u201cSexual Life\u201d to train doctors and other professionals working with Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nSerious injury changes the life of not only the veteran but also their partner, Serdyuk explained.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, Ukrainian society believes that a good wife should take care of her husband on her own, even if there is an opportunity to get help. A woman becomes a carer. What kind of sex can we talk about then?\u201d Serdyuk said, referring to how the pressures of full-time caring can lessen a couple\u2019s capacity to explore paths to sexual fulfilment.\n\n\u201cEven if we are talking about complete dysfunction or missing genitals, a person (who\u2019s been injured) can still have an orgasm with pleasure. You have to work with your fantasies, study your body.\u201d\n\nPeople need to learn to accept themselves in a new way, and believe in their integrity, their body, Serdyuk said.\n\nUkrainian \u2018Bachelor\u2019 stars double amputee\n\nDiscussions surrounding disabilities are increasingly cropping up in Ukraine as casualties rise.\n\nPopular dating show \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has taken the discussion into the mainstream, with 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko \u2013 who lost both his legs in the war - cast as the star of the latest season.\n\nAn episode with an intimate scene, shown in November, became one of the most popular in the season. According to data provided by Starlight Media, a Ukrainian broadcasting group, about 2.8 million people all around the country watched it, making it the most viewed program on the day it aired.\n\nAn episode of the TV show \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d featured an intimate scene with the season's star, 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran Oleksandr Budko, who lost both his legs in the war. STB Channel/Starlight Media\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in the history of the show among all countries of the world that a man with a double amputation has become a Bachelor,\u201d show producer Anna Kalyna told CNN.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned about how people would react to seeing a person\u2019s body with visible amputations in such an intimate context. There is no representation of people living with injuries in Ukraine and we didn\u2019t know how people would react to it. It was a big challenge. But it turned out well.\u201d\n\nKalyna thinks the audience was interested, in part, because they realize that in this time of war their own loved ones could be injured at any moment.\n\nOn his Instagram page, Budko said he was not taking part in the show to convince anyone of anything or prove his \u201cnormality.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy prostheses or even sometimes a wheelchair are just a part of me, but not what defines me,\u201d he posted. \u201cThe fact that I have a disability does not make me less worthy of love or a happy life. And this is important to understand.\u201d\n\nBudko also posted that his first experience of sex after injury \u201cwas not just sex, but a step back to life.\u201d\n\nChoosing life over suffering\n\nAmong those to attend Recovery\u2019s \u201cSexual Life\u201d course is Oleksandr Batalov. The unit infantry commander, who works as an osteopath in civil life, lost his leg in a fierce battle on the front line. He recalls that it took time for him to get used to his changed body.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, with such trauma, you want no one to look at you. But my wife gave me huge support. So, I got a grip. I chose life, not suffering,\u201d he said. The psychologist helped a lot, he added.\n\nThere are very few sexologists in the hospitals, he said, but men who have experienced serious injuries are talking about sex with one another, and that\u2019s important. However, \u201cthey need to have specialists they can talk to\u201d as well, Batalov said.\n\nWar veteran Oleksandr Batalov attended the Recovery network's \"Sexual Life\" course after losing his leg on the battlefield and hopes to share his knowledge with others. CNN\n\nThat\u2019s why he is starting this course. \u201cIf you survived, you have to live. Despite the injury, my life is full and interesting, I want to leave and study and share the knowledge,\u201d said Batalov, who is now working again as an osteopath.\n\nThe same goes for Tsymbaliuk, the injured combat medic. She decided to live a fulfilling life no matter what. Her boyfriend did not give up and proposed again.\n\nAfter months of rehabilitation in Germany, and later in Ukraine\u2019s Superhumans Center, she finally married him, realizing \u201cshe was full of love that she wanted to fulfil.\u201d Four months ago, they welcomed their first child together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding my prosthetic. I\u2019m living a full life. And I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Victoria Butenko contributed reporting.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nNearly a quarter century after Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin, the rocket company is poised for its most defining moment to date: sending a vehicle to orbit for the first time.\n\nBlue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket is set to make its inaugural launch attempt as soon as 1 a.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live stream of the mission is slated to kick off about an hour before liftoff on the social media platform X, Blue Origin\u2019s YouTube channel, and its website, the company said via email.\n\nThe new target launch time was announced after Blue Origin chose to wave off plans to get New Glenn off the ground in the early hours of Sunday morning. The company said weather conditions at sea, where the company hopes to recover part of the rocket after launch, prompted the 24-hour delay.\n\nThe roughly 320-foot (98-meter) New Glenn is not only the first Blue Origin rocket designed to be capable of hauling satellites to space, it\u2019s also among the most powerful in the world. Categorized as a heavy-lift launch vehicle, it packs more than twice the power that SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket gives off during takeoff.\n\nThe uncrewed New Glenn mission will carry Blue Origin-made demonstration technology, called the Blue Ring Pathfinder, to orbit.\n\nIf successful, New Glenn\u2019s launch debut could position Blue Origin to better compete with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u2014 which has long dominated the commercial launch sector.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the New Glenn rocket will fire up seven BE-4 engines at the base of its first-stage rocket booster, which is the largest part of the vehicle that gives the first burst of power at liftoff.\n\nA few minutes into flight, after burning through most of its fuel, the booster will detach from the upper portion of the rocket, which includes the vehicle\u2019s nose cone, or payload fairing, that\u2019s designed to shield cargo during liftoff.\n\nThe booster will then use fins and strakes \u2014 or winglike attachments that flare out from its top and base, respectively \u2014 to help guide itself toward its landing target, a seafaring recovery platform named Jacklyn after Bezos\u2019 mother.\n\nJust before touching down on the platform, the booster will reignite some of its engines and deploy six massive legs to stand on.\n\nA visualization depicts the New Glenn rocket's launch, separation of the first and upper stage, and separation of the nose cone, or payload fairing. The nose cone is a protective shell that shields the cargo. Blue Origin\n\nThe landing maneuver, designed to allow Blue Origin to refurbish and reuse rocket boosters\u2014 much like SpaceX does with its Falcon rockets \u2014 is an attempt to save money and drive down the cost of launches.\n\nMeanwhile, the upper portion of New Glenn, carrying the Blue Ring Pathfinder experiment, will continue toward the cosmos.\n\nTwo engines, optimized to function in the vacuum of space, should fire up and propel the vehicle to speeds necessary to enter orbit \u2014 typically around 17,500 miles per hour, or nearly 23 times the speed of sound.\n\nFor this flight, Blue Origin said it will not deploy a satellite into orbit. Rather, the Blue Ring Pathfinder payload is expected to remain attached to the rocket\u2019s upper stage for the duration of the six-hour mission.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake\n\nSuccess is not guaranteed.\n\nAt any point during the flight, New Glenn could encounter a mission-ending failure. So far, the company has only ignited all seven BE-4 engines at the base of this rocket for 24 seconds during a ground test in late December.\n\nFor this flight, the engines must fire for at least several times that duration as New Glenn attempts to defy Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\n\nIf something goes wrong, and New Glenn begins to fly off its intended course, the company may be forced to implement a self-destruct feature \u2014 blowing the rocket to smithereens so it will not pose a threat to people or property.\n\nThe Blue Ring Pathfinder demonstrator (foreground), is seen with one half of the New Glenn rocket's payload fairing, or nose cone (background), on December 9, 2024. The demo will test technology that will be incoporated in Blue Origin's proposed spacecraft called Blue Ring. Courtesy Blue Origin\n\nBlue Origin could also see success on its primary mission: safely getting the rocket\u2019s second stage and Blue Ring Pathfinder technology into its intended orbit. But even if that objective goes to plan, the company may still fail to land its New Glenn rocket booster on the Jacklyn platform after launch.\n\nFailure to safely land the rocket booster, however, would not make the mission unsuccessful: Recovering rocket parts for reuse is a feat aimed solely at saving Blue Origin money. Most rocket builders, apart from SpaceX, discard that portion of the rocket after launch anyway.\n\nIf and when New Glenn proves it can get the job done, the vehicle is likely to make a big splash in the launch market, said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector.\n\n\u201cThey are postured so that they can come in and try to fill this role of being the next great, reliable launch provider for the industry,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThe New Glenn is a heavy-lift vehicle, Henry noted, and vehicles of its size and power have \u201cgrown in importance over the years.\u201d\n\nRoughly a decade ago, rocket companies anticipated that small, lightweight rockets would become the next launch phenomenon because they would be capable of rapidly launching satellites intended to flesh out a string of megaconstellations \u2014 or networks of small satellites \u2014 in low-Earth orbit.\n\n\u201cBut two things happened,\u201d Henry said. \u201cFirst is that none of the constellation (operators) went to small rockets. They all went to the medium- or heavy-lift because getting more up in a single mission is faster and more economical than doing this one or two satellites at a time. And then the second is those satellites themselves got bigger.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFederal investigators are now warning professional athletes across multiple sports following a rise in sophisticated home burglaries thought to be emanating from international criminals.\n\nThe warning comes as the NFL, NBA and NHL informed teams in November that organized and skilled groups were targeting the homes of athletes for break-ins, including while the players are away at games.\n\n\u201cThese homes are targeted for burglary due to the perception they may have high-end goods like designer handbags, jewelry, watches, and cash,\u201d the FBI said in a December 20 bulletin obtained by CNN that was recently distributed to US professional athletic associations.\n\nIn the bulletin, first reported by ABC News, bureau analysts said, \u201cBetween September and November 2024, organized theft groups allegedly burglarized the homes of at least nine professional athletes and targeted entry points including glass rear doors, windows, and second-story doors.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile home burglaries involving sporting stars continued into December, with the homes of NBA star Luca Doncic and NFL star Joe Burrow targeted.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about how the burglars operate:\n\nThey do advanced recon\n\nThe latest FBI bulletin indicated many of the tactics mirror those of South American criminal gangs, who \u201cconduct physical and technical surveillance in preparation for these burglaries. The perpetrators also use publicly available information and social media to identify a pattern of life for a prospective victim and often know in advance where valuables are kept in a home.\u201d\n\nInvestigators said advanced reconnaissance and preparation have allowed criminals to conduct high-end burglaries at athletes\u2019 homes very quickly, \u201cparticularly while they are at games or on travel.\u201d\n\nIn its warning the NFL issued to players in November, the league said thieves \u201cappear to exploit team schedules to target athletes\u2019 homes on game days.\u201d\n\nSome burglary groups, the NFL memo says, conduct extensive surveillance, including by making \u201cattempted home deliveries\u201d and \u201cposing as grounds maintenance or joggers in a neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThey use sophisticated technology\n\nAs part of their advanced preparation and execution of burglaries targeting athletes, criminal gangs have employed sophisticated technology, officials warn.\n\n\u201cOrganized theft groups bypass alarm systems, use Wi-Fi jammers to block Wi-Fi connections and disable devices, cover security cameras, and obfuscate their identities,\u201d the FBI warned in its notice to players.\n\nIn some cases, the suspects \u201clie in wait in these ghillie suits so they remain camouflaged,\u201d Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer previously told CNN during an interview about the work his California prosecutor office is doing to combat transnational gangs staging high-end burglaries.\n\nSome of the burglary suspects have used ghillie suits, like the one seen here, to camouflage their movements. Orange County D.A.\n\n\u201cThey take advantage of the fact that most people don\u2019t have window sensors or motion detectors on their second floors. They have WiFi jammers to stop the alarm company from being notified.\u201d\n\nThey seem to target the most popular athletes\n\nIn October, the homes of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce were burglarized.\n\nDoncic, a guard on the Dallas Mavericks, had his home burglarized late last month, with criminals making off with $30,000 in jewelry, according to internal police documents reviewed by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nBurrow, quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals, said he felt \u201cviolated\u201d after his Ohio house was broken into last month when he was facing the Dallas Cowboys in Texas.\n\nAsked about the rash of burglaries last month, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted the FBI\u2019s involvement and the general awareness of the issue around the league.\n\n\u201cI think all of that is something that we all are trying to address,\u201d Goodell said, \u201cbut it\u2019s clear there\u2019s some organized fashion here that we hope that the FBI and the authorities can handle.\u201d\n\nThis weekend may be of particular concern for the league as the NFL Playoffs begin with two games on Saturday, three on Sunday and one on Monday.\n\nTips to prevent becoming a victim\n\nIn the FBI bulletin, analysts said players should be on the lookout for potential indicators that a burglary is being planned.\n\nThose clues include observing \u201cindividuals with technical surveillance tools such as drones, signal jammers, GPS devices, lawn cameras, thermal imaging devices, and other burglary tools such as picklocks, crowbars, screwdrivers, and slide hammers.\u201d\n\nOther warning signs include people \u201cfollowing athletes to their homes, posing as lawncare workers, food delivery persons, or mechanics/repairmen,\u201d the FBI said, as well as \u201cirregular delivery vehicles/companies frequenting the area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen traveling out of town, employ and arm surveillance and alarm systems, employ additional security, and engage with private security and homeowners\u2019 association security,\u201d the bureau bulletin advised.\n\nIn addition to bolstering physical security measures, the FBI suggested players watch what they post on social media, \u201cto include refraining from posting pictures of valuables, the interior of one\u2019s home, and real-time posts when on vacation.\u201d",

Medications and passports, of course. Some clothes. Most importantly, the pets.\n\nAs Santa Ana winds propelled a series of raging wildfires that wiped out homes and businesses across once-picturesque swaths of Southern California \u2013 killing at least 16 people \u2013 tens of thousands have been forced from their homes this week in a haze of uncertainty: What to pack? How long will they be gone? What will they return to?\n\nDestruction on their doorstep, evacuees like Maryam Zar grabbed what they could in their final whirlwind moments at home.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just kind of on autopilot,\u201d said Zar, former chair of the Pacific Palisades Community Council, who knew her hillside California neighborhood has long been vulnerable to wildfires. \u201cIn my head I had sort of thought it through. So I ran through the house pretty quickly and gathered it together. As I look back, I think I pretty much got all the things I would have wanted to get.\u201d\n\nWith the fast-spreading blaze approaching her Pacific Palisades home on Tuesday, Zar grabbed a suitcase and some bags. She recalled the pungent smell of burned eucalyptus trees, their sap and bark extremely flammable. A wave of flames flashed through a rear window. Thick smoke turned the sky murky orange.\n\nZar\u2019s teenage son grabbed sweatshirts and shoes. Her daughter, in her 20s, packed extra clothing because she was traveling in a few days. Zar rushed to a drawer and grabbed from it passports, as well as insurance and banking documents. She packed a few pieces of clothing that had \u201cemotional value.\u201d Three pairs of pants and some shirts for her husband, who was out at the time. And the old watch case, which belonged to her late father.\n\nMaryam Zar grabbed some old and recents photo albums \u2013 \"a sampling of family history and the recent past\u201d \u2013 before evacuating her home. CNN\n\n\u201cI reached for a couple of old albums, just really old pictures, and then a couple of newer frames,\u201d Zar said. \u201cI thought, you know, I can\u2019t take it all, but if I can just have some, then this is a sampling of family history and the recent past.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, Zar stopped in her son\u2019s room and took a leather-bound booklet, engraved with his name, that they had recently given him.\n\n\u201cI thought, well, maybe we\u2019ll write, you know, as we go through the next few days, we\u2019ll just kind of write what we\u2019re going through,\u201d said Zar, who\u2019s now staying with her family in Redondo Beach.\n\nFinally, they rounded up the cats and made a \u201cmad dash\u201d for their cars, she said. As they headed out, Zar\u2019s husband arrived. A blizzard of embers had turned an affluent coastal community into an inferno.\n\nZar\u2019s husband hosed down the ground around their home. He extinguished small flames in a neighbor\u2019s yard, she said. And he took one last possession on his escape.\n\n\u201cHe had thought of something that I had forgotten, and he grabbed it. It happened to be a car,\u201d she recalled.\n\nHe climbed into his vintage sports car and sped away. Houses and steep hills burned under wind-driven embers. On traffic-choked roads, some people abandoned their cars and walked.\n\n\u2018I had no more fight left at that point\u2019\n\nAlong with her home in Altadena, Raya Reynaga says, the wildfires took her \"brother\u2019s ashes. My daughter\u2019s mementos. My keepsakes. My deceased mother\u2019s photos and belongings that she passed down to me.\u201d Courtesy Raya Reynaga\n\nAt an evacuation shelter in Pasadena, volunteers dispensed food, water and clothes to people who fled with little time and little more than what they were wearing. Evacuees rested on cots. Some had pets.\n\nRaya Reynaga was there to pick up underwear, socks and shoes. \u201cI\u2019m wearing other people\u2019s clothes right now,\u201d she told CNN Thursday.\n\nShe was among the many Southern Californians who tried to fight off the flames with garden hoses. The Eaton fire \u2013 one of a few major fires raging across Los Angeles County \u2013 consumed her 103-year-old, English-inspired cottage in Altadena, a neighborhood nestled in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\n\u201cI tried to save my house because that\u2019s all I have,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever worked for my entire life was there. My work equipment. My brother\u2019s ashes. My daughter\u2019s mementos. My keepsakes. My deceased mother\u2019s photos and belongings that she passed down to me.\u201d\n\nReynaga lived in the house nearly three decades. She was one of the last people left on her block after the fires started on Tuesday. The hose she used had little pressure against the growing flames. She dropped to her knees and prayed: God please save my house.\n\nReynaga, a CPR instructor, recalled a firefighter telling her, \u201c\u2018Your life is at risk. You have to leave.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI just broke down\u2026 I had no more fight left at that point. I knew it was over.\u201d\n\nShe drove away from home, ash smeared on her face. Embers rained down around her. By that time all she could take were the cats. When Reynaga returned on Wednesday, the historic cottage was gone, along with so much that was meaningful to her.\n\n\u201cI was speechless,\u201d said Reynaga, who\u2019s now staying at her father\u2019s home. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t care about stuff. Stuff is just stuff. But what I can\u2019t get back are the family photos. What I can\u2019t get back is the family heirlooms that my mother passed down\u2026 I can\u2019t get back the pillows she made me. I can\u2019t get back the little sewing and knitting kits she passed down from her mother to me.\u201d\n\nEmbers hit bike helmet as he rode away\n\nFrancois Auroux rode his bike to his family\u2019s Pacific Palisades home on Tuesday night. He found the back of his home on fire and quickly doused the flames with a hose. Several houses across the street were fully engulfed.\n\n\u201cI ran and grabbed a hard drive that our family photos were on. I grabbed a couple of our family heirlooms,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stuffed heirlooms, dating to the 1700s, in a backpack and duffel bag. He grabbed his grandfather\u2019s beloved model of an old steam tug. Lastly, he snatched two paintings closest to the front door, including one by the Greek painter Alekos Fassianos.\n\nOne item Pacific Palisades resident Francois Auroux saved when he fled home on a bicycle was a model ship that belonged to his grandfather. Courtesy Francois Aroux\n\n\u201cI was thinking about all the things that I didn\u2019t get and that I could have gotten really quickly but didn\u2019t because it was literally like, I thought the house was going to burn. I\u2019ve never been in a situation like that,\u201d said Auroux, his voice filled with emotion.\n\nOutside, embers swirled like tiny red-orange tornadoes across his front yard, Auroux was approached by an KNBC reporter.\n\n\u201cThis is our house. The backyard\u2019s on fire. I\u2019m out of here,\u201d he told the reporter, the camera rolling. \u201cYou can take these paintings, I guess.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nVenezuelans once again watched as Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn into office on Friday, donning the executive sash and declaring himself president despite irregularities and questions around his election.\n\nHe repeated his attacks against the United States and any foreign leaders who did not recognize his return to power and vowed to squash all of those who oppose him.\n\n\u201cI come from the people. The power I represent belongs to the people and I owe it to the people,\u201d Maduro told allies and supporters in his inauguration speech.\n\nFor many Venezuelans, there will have been a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as Maduro assumed his third six-year term in office following the contested July 28 election.\n\nThe country\u2019s National Electoral Council, the body responsible for supervising and certifying the vote, which is stacked with some of his closest loyalists, had declared Maduro the winner without providing detailed evidence or data to support his victory.\n\nBut the opposition disputed the claim, releasing tens of thousands of voting tallies from around the country claiming that their candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had actually won with 67% against Maduro\u2019s 30%.\n\nThe tallies were found to be legitimate by independent observers, such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission, as well as CNN\u2019s own analysis.\n\nSeveral nations, including the United States, have since recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president-elect and have issued new sanctions against Maduro and some of the country\u2019s electoral authorities.\n\nFellow opposition leader Maria Corina Machado accused Maduro of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in a video posted to social media after he was sworn in for the third time. She said that with his inauguration \u201cthey decided to cross the red line\u201d and \u201cthey stomp on our constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, Maduro did not put the presidential band on his chest, he put it on his ankle like a shackle that would tighten more every day,\u201d she added.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez appears in Madrid's Puerta del Sol square to support the protest against election results in Venezuela on September 28, 2024. Ana Beltran/Reuters\n\nA contested comeback\n\nThis is not the first time a Maduro victory has been called into question. In fact, every presidential vote in which he\u2019s been a candidate, dating back to when he first took office nearly 12 years ago, has been disputed.\n\nMaduro first became president following the death of his predecessor and mentor Hugo Chavez in March 2013. The larger-than-life populist strongman \u2013 who had enshrined himself in power for nearly 15 years as the anti-establishment leader and transformed the country under his socialist-leaning Bolivarian Revolution \u2013 had hand-picked Maduro as his successor.\n\nDespite the endorsement, Maduro struggled in the polls and only beat his then-challenger Henrique Capriles by a razor-thin margin of 1.49%. It was considered at the time as one of the closest ballots in decades and the opposition claimed irregularities and fraud in the vote.\n\nCapriles, who had run against Chavez six months earlier and lost by 12%, called for an audit with the National Electoral Council and appealed the results with the Supreme Court. Both bodies were stacked with Chavez and Maduro supporters and the opposition\u2019s claims were discredited.\n\nBy the time Maduro\u2019s second presidential election was scheduled to take place, Venezuela had fallen into a deep economic and political crisis. The once oil-rich country was suffering from hyperinflation and widespread economic woes. There were massive food shortages, rampant crime and millions of people had fled the country in fear and desperation.\n\nMany opposition leaders, including Capriles, were banned from running for political office with some arrested or forced into exile due to trumped-up accusations and charges.\n\nAnti-government demonstrators shout slogans as supporters of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ride past on motorcycles during an opposition protest on the eve of Maduro's inauguration, in Caracas on Thursday. Pedro Mattey/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMaduro was reelected to his second term in May 2018, in what the opposition and many foreign leaders called a sham election due to the low voter turnout and an opposition boycott following the bans against its candidates. Only 46% of the country\u2019s population participated in the vote, the National Electoral Council said at the time, and Maduro was sworn into office in January 2019.\n\nMassive protests broke out in the streets of the capital Caracas and throughout the country, questioning his legitimacy and calling for him to step down. This was not the first time the country had seen protests, but they were heavily repressed by the Maduro-supporting National Guard, police forces and militia groups and led to several deaths, injuries and arrests.\n\nGlobal leaders shun Maduro return\n\nAs Maduro takes office for the third time, he finds himself more isolated than ever.\n\nHis inauguration lacked the usual pomp and pageantry that normally surrounds the event. Cuba and Nicaragua were the only two countries with their presidents in attendance. Meanwhile, the ceremony itself was markedly lowkey in comparison to previous events, held in a small room of the National Assembly rather than the building\u2019s main hall.\n\nProtesters also returned to the streets of Venezuela and the country\u2019s growing diaspora staged marches in Ecuador, Spain and Mexico, among other locations.\n\nBiden administration officials met earlier this week in Washington DC with Gonz\u00e1lez, who was recognized by the US as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president-elect.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez, who has been living in exile after being accused of terrorism by the Maduro government, had vowed to return to the country to challenge the inauguration but said the \u201cconditions for his entry\u201d were not met. He posted a video message to his social media accounts from the Dominican Republic, in which he also accused Maduro of staging a coup.\n\n\u201cMaduro has violated the Constitution, and the sovereign will of Venezuelans expressed on July 28,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cHe carried out a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and crowned himself a dictator.\u201d\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump issued a harsh warning against Maduro following reports that Machado had been briefly kidnapped following a protest. The Maduro government denied any involvement.\n\nShortly after the inauguration, the US announced a $25 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his closest officials, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. Washington also announced an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for eligible Venezuelan nationals, which could benefit some 600,000 people living in the US.\n\nNearly 8 million Venezuelans have left the country over the last decade, the second largest displacement in the world, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nVenezuelans are bracing for yet another wave of repression following Maduro\u2019s return. One Latin American diplomat told CNN earlier this week that the atmosphere in the country was \u201cfearful.\u201d Maduro and his allies are \u201cshowing they are not going to tolerate any dissent, and people are scared,\u201d said the diplomat, who spoke anonymously to avoid possible repercussions.\n\nThe strongman leader may have succeeded in reclaiming Venezuela\u2019s highest office but with so many \u2013 both at home and abroad \u2013 still questioning if he stole the election, he could find himself struggling for allies on the world stage.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nGermany is working to secure a drifting Russian oil tanker, believed to be part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to fund its war in Ukraine, after it lost control in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Eventin tanker, carrying nearly 100,000 tons of oil thought to be from Russia, lost power near the German island of R\u00fcgen on Friday, Germany\u2019s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said. By Saturday, three tugboats were still working to tow the 274-meter-long Panamanian-flagged tanker to safety.\n\nThe Eventin departed from Russia and was headed for Egypt, according to MarineTraffic, a monitoring group.\n\nCCME said the tugboat convoy was working to tow the Eventin to Sassnitz, a port on R\u00fcgen, but that the stormy conditions were \u201cslowing the towing process considerably.\u201d\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the \u201cdecrepit\u201d oil tanker was another example of the danger Russia poses to European security.\n\nSince Western countries sanctioned Russia\u2019s oil exports, the Kremlin has relied on old, sometimes Soviet-era tankers \u2013 known as its \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2013 to transport oil to buyers across the world.\n\n\u201cWith the unscrupulous use of a fleet of rusting tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin not only circumvents sanctions but also deliberately accepts the risk of halting tourism in the Baltic Sea region,\u201d Baerbock said Friday.\n\nThe Kremlin, which has previously refused to respond to accusations that it uses a \u201cshadow fleet,\u201d has not yet commented on the incident.\n\nThe West has grown increasingly alarmed by Russia\u2019s dependence on this aging fleet, which has wreaked environmental havoc in the Black Sea and implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast.\n\nIn December, two Russian tankers were wrecked off the coast of occupied Crimea, spilling thousands of tons of fuel into the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the ships \u2013 nearly 50 years old \u2013 \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been in operation at all.\u201d\n\nThose two tankers carried around 10,000 tons of fuel between them \u2013 10 times less than the Eventin.\n\nLater in December, Finnish authorities seized a tanker traveling from Russia, on suspicion it had used its anchor to damage an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia.\n\nGerman authorities said no oil leaks had been detected after the Eventin lost power on Friday, but warned of strong winds and waves of up to 2.5 meters (over 8 feet).\n\nZelensky called the tanker \u201can oil bomb that, fortunately, didn\u2019t detonate.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day, Russia bombards Ukraine, and it finances its missiles, strike drones, and guided bombs, in part, with profits from its tanker fleet. Russia jeopardizes the environment solely to sustain its ability to kill people,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nAlso on Friday, the outgoing Biden administration targeted Russia\u2019s energy sector, including its so-called \u201cshadow fleet,\u201d with some of its harshest sanctions to date. Zelensky welcomed the move.\n\nThe sanctions target nearly 200 oil-carrying vessels, many thought to be part of the fleet. A senior administration official said: \u201cWe expect our actions to cost Russia upwards of billions of dollars per month.\u201d\n\nIn December 2022, the Group of Seven (G7) nations capped the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel. The cap was designed to be enforced by companies that provide shipping, insurance and other services for Russian oil. If a buyer agreed to pay more than the cap, the companies would withhold their services.\n\nTo dodge these sanctions, Russia has used aging, often uninsured tankers flagged in countries that do not observe the G7 sanctions.\n\nThe Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Finnish think-tank, said 420 vessels exported Russian crude oil and oil products last month, of which 234 were \u201cshadow tankers,\u201d and 30% of these were at least 20 years old.",

            "text": "Northern Argentina CNN \u2014\n\nEven for a very frequent flier, this is a singular first.\n\nIt\u2019s October, and I\u2019m zipping over northern Argentina in a Cessna Grand Caravan \u2014 the kind of workhorse airplane I used to skydive out of a lifetime ago. The plan is to stay inside, but this flight still thrills because the passenger list includes a wild jaguar.\n\nAnd it has just woken up.\n\nThe 74-year-old woman sitting next to me shows concern \u2014 not for our safety \u2014 but that of the apex predator in the box right behind our seats.\n\nWe started the journey a few hours before at a jaguar reintroduction center in the wetlands of Iber\u00e1 National Park. After the vet sedated the cat with a dart and prepared to stuff her ears with cotton to muffle the propeller noise, the once-CEO of Patagonia Kristine Tompkins looked on with mothering concern.\n\n\u201cIt must have been exhilarating, the first few times you did this,\u201d I said in a hush.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating still,\u201d she replied, eyes locked on the jaguar. \u201cBut so many things can go wrong. I just worry about how it\u2019s all going to go. What\u2019s the stress on the animal? The stress on the team?\u201d\n\nOn the plane, I peek at the groggy cat through an air hole in the box and then out the Caravan window at the town of Juan Jos\u00e9 Castelli below \u2014 our landing spot. It strikes me how the folks below would never imagine a wild jaguar in the sky, because such a translocation has never been tried. But if the woman on the plane has her way, this is just the beginning; Chaco Province will be part of the most ambitious conservation project on Earth.\n\nKris Tompkins carefully feeds a jaguar at the jaguar reintroduction center in Iber\u00e1 National Park, Argentina, October 2024. Julian Quinones/CNN\n\nTompkins wants to rewild the Americas. She wants pampas deer, giant anteaters, river otters and pumas to return to healthy numbers across South America. And she dreams of a day when jaguars \u2014 the biggest cats on the continent \u2014 can once again roam from Argentina to Texas.\n\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s so many projects that can and should be taken on immediately to bring breeding populations of jaguars back to the United States,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cThat\u2019s a no brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can imagine the headlines,\u201d I reply, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat about the fear? The predator stigma?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to put (the idea) out there,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cWith a plan that addresses the fears with a tremendous amount of social interaction and education. But I haven\u2019t seen an example where a species has been reintroduced and has been made extinct again by neighbors. I just haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d\n\nA love story for the ages\n\nIf anyone can make such an audacious claim, it\u2019s the woman who helped create or expand 15 national parks in South America, thanks to a life of rugged adventure, and a romance for the ages.\n\nKristine McDivitt Tompkins grew up on a California ranch and was always drawn to outdoor types, so she fell into her first job with rock climber Yvon Chouinard and his new outdoor equipment company. They called it Patagonia.\n\nKris Tompkins became CEO of outdoor apparel brand Patagonia in the 1970s, overseeing the company's early years. Gary Regester\n\nKris Tompkins as a child, pictured atop a horse, 1958. Tompkins Family Archives\n\nBy 28, she was CEO, and at 43 she found the love of her life in the wilds of southern Chile. One of Chouinard\u2019s best friends \u2014 North Face and Esprit founder Doug Tompkins \u2014 made such an impression that after one off-the-grid trip together, she retired, packed two bags and moved into his cabin.\n\nThey had no phones or internet, but they had each other, Doug\u2019s plane (a tough, single-engine Husky) and a burning desire to protect the Patagonian wilderness from the ravages of cattle ranches and soy plantations. Doug would cash in stock, sell his legendary art collection and buy millions of acres in Chile and Argentina with the grand plan of giving it all away as national parks.\n\nBut locals were naturally suspicious, and conspiracy theories began to fly. Some believed they were going to melt the glaciers and sell the water to China or create a shelter for Jewish people to escape World War III.\n\nDoug (right) and Kris Tompkins, pictured outside their home in Renihue, Chile, near what would become a national park they helped create in Pumalin. Tompkins Family Archives\n\n\u201cThe first five years were very rough,\u201d Kris recalls. \u201cDeath threats and a lot of upheaval for team members.\u201d She says their phones were tapped and Chilean military planes would even buzz the Tompkins\u2019 cabin, but they preserved until the politics changed and they could prove their intent with the opening of Pumalin National Park.\n\n\u201cThere were trails and campgrounds and a restaurant and a little hotel. And the infrastructure was beautiful and respectful, and everything was for free. You didn\u2019t have to pay to camp,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that really was a tectonic shift because people could see that while we may be crazy, we were doing what we were said.\u201d\n\nBut in the winter of 2015, just as public sentiment was swinging their way, Doug fell out of a kayak on a massive South American lake and died of hypothermia. Kris was left to complete their vision, with their team, but without her soulmate.\n\n\u201cWhen he died, he took the best of me with him, and I kept the best of him with me,\u201d she told me back in 2016, in the first TV interview after his death. \u201cI carry him around with me in the pocket of my heart. But he left me with so much.\u201d\n\n\"Live with no fear,\" says Kris Tompkins. Tompkins Family Archives\n\nA giant step for Mini\n\nEight years later, we\u2019re together again as the plane bounces down on a grass strip and the team from Rewilding Argentina, an organization that spun out of Tompkins Conservation, transfers the precious passenger onto the bed of a 4x4. Under a blazing sun, we set out on the dusty, bouncy four-hour drive to a place fittingly known as El Impenetrable.\n\nWith over 500 square miles of brambles and cacti, roseate spoonbills and howler monkeys, the forest is second only to the Amazon in continuous size in South America, but after generations of hunting and human encroachment, only a handful of jaguars remain. As the only members of the genus Panthera in the Americas, the biggest male jaguars can tip 350 pounds but the 120-pound female in the box is small enough to be named Mini.\n\n\u201cThe names are all their chosen by schoolchildren,\u201d Kris tells me.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch a wild jaguar take her first steps into a new future 03:10 - Source: CNN\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s this debate in science,\u201d I reply. \u201cThat we shouldn\u2019t anthropomorphize wild animals and give them names?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s baloney,\u201d she shoots back. \u201cExactly what you would call her? \u201827?\u2019 Really? Fabulous,\u201d she says with deadpan sarcasm. \u201c\u2019You mean so much to us. We\u2019re going to name you 27.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the jaguar reintroduction center in Iber\u00e1 National Park, where the big cats are bred, the teams from Rewilding Argentina isolate jaguar cubs from human contact from the moment they are born and they spend the first couple of years learning to hunt in huge enclosures. Mini was one of 28 successful jaguar releases into Iber\u00e1 and now has the distinction of being the first one moved into an entirely new ecosystem in the Gran Chaco.\n\nIt\u2019s almost dark by the time we reach her new, temporary home and there is an awed hush among the team as we watch her disappear into the forested five-acre pen. She\u2019ll acclimate here for about eight months before she\u2019s released into the wild. Within hours, the males in El Impenetrable show signs that they know she\u2019s here. So for them \u2014 and for Kris and Rewilding Argentina \u2014 release day can\u2019t come soon enough.\n\n\u201cDoug would be so proud,\u201d I tell her, but she demurs with praise for the team and when pressed, offers the biggest lesson learned over her wild life.\n\n\u201cLive with no fear. Live with the real sense that you\u2019ve got to get up every day and go for broke. You know, when Doug died, I lost all fear because the worst thing that could happen to me had happened. He\u2019s been gone nine years now, but I feel that. Every day. Go for broke. You have nothing to be afraid of.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify details of Kris Tompkins\u2019 personal life.",

And if Saturday night\u2019s dominant win over the Pittsburgh Steelers is any indication, that could take them all the way to New Orleans.\n\nThe thunder-and-lightning duo highlighted a Baltimore running attack that went for a team postseason record of 299 yards, pacing the Ravens to a 28-14 win over their AFC North rivals.\n\nHenry ran for 186 yards on 26 tough carries, punishing the Steeler defense repeatedly with tough runs right into the teeth of the defensive line. He found the right seams, breaking for a long touchdown run and a shorter bruiser for his two scores.\n\nJackson meanwhile was electric as only he can be. He rushed 15 times for 81 yards while also completing 16 of 21 passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. The rowdy 70,000 fans at M&T Bank Stadium routinely serenaded their star with chants of \u201cM-V-P!\u201d and it\u2019s hard to make the case that anyone else is truly better than the dual-threat quarterback when he\u2019s on top of his game.\n\nJackson said after the game that Henry reminded him of Lighting McQueen from the movie \u201cCars.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know when Lightning McQueen just flying, flashing past?\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s how Derrick looks when he\u2019s passing all those guys.

So now, when they attacking him then I go (and) I\u2019m fresh. It makes my job a lot easier.\u201d\n\nJackson and Henry simply ran through, around and over the Steelers\u2019 defense on a massive drive to start the game, going 95 yards to open the scoring. The biggest play of the drive was Henry taking a direct snap and finding a seam in the Steelers\u2019 front seven, bursting for 34 yards in a play that was punctuated by a brutal stiff arm that sent Steelers star safety Minkah Fitzpatrick reeling. Head coach John Harbaugh said that play was put into the playbook specifically for this game against the Steelers.\n\nBut the score came on Jackson making an MVP-level throw to Rashod Bateman, cutting across the middle of the Pittsburgh defense in the back of the end zone. Bateman caught the ball and rolled through, securing it to put the Ravens up 7-0.\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson runs with the ball against the Pittsburgh Steelers during the first half of an NFL wild-card playoff football game. Stephanie Scarbrough/AP\n\nThe drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Henry and Jackson used their legs to punish the Steelers\u2019 defense.\n\nThe sequence that best told the story was an 85-yard, 13-play drive in the second quarter that featured exactly zero passes. Jackson broke loose for a big 19-yard run that left him feeling some discomfort, but it didn\u2019t seem to slow him down as he scrambled for gains on the next two plays before handing the ball off to Henry for another bruising run as the Ravens neared the red zone.\n\n\u201cI just think Lamar was seeing it, and he was doing a great job of pulling it and making plays and getting the most out of a play,\u201d Henry said in the locker room after the game. \u201cAnd guys did a great job blocking for it to open up.\u201d\n\nA sweep to Henry put the Ravens inside the 10-yard line after a 17-yard pickup and the Steelers defense seemed to have no answer for the punishing running attack.\n\nHenry pounded through the tackles one more time to get into the end zone, putting an exclamation point on a physically dominating drive.\n\n\u201cI was focused on doing my job each and every play. Credit to the offensive line, doing a great job. Tight ends, receivers and fullbacks blocking for me and for us to have a successful offense,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when the Ravens wanted to move fast, they could do that too. Just before halftime, Jackson led his offense down the field in 1:51, punctuating an incredible first half with a third touchdown to put Baltimore up 21-0 going into the break.\n\n\u201cHe runs around and finds a touchdown pass. And I think I just think in his head, he knows what 11 seconds is,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt goes a little faster for me, I was like, \u2018Throw that thing away!\u201d You know, it\u2019s like, all I could say is wow.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers looked a bit more lively coming out of the locker room, stopping Baltimore on their first drive before getting on the board for the first time with a 30-yard pass from Russell Wilson to wide receiver Van Jefferson.\n\nIt was the first sign of life for Pittsburgh, and the Ravens looked to stamp it out immediately on the following drive. Returning to the run game, Henry found a seam in the Pittsburgh defense and took a 44-yard run to the house that seemed to put Baltimore on easy street.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson throws a pass against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half of an NFL wild-card playoff football game. Stephanie Scarbrough/AP\n\nWilson wasn\u2019t going away though. Having found success going over the top of the Ravens defense on the Steelers\u2019 first drive of the second half, Wilson went back to that strategy and connected with wideout George Pickens for another long touchdown, this time for 36 yards making the score 28-14. The Steelers held the Ravens to their first three-and-out of the game on the next drive and suddenly Pittsburgh looked back in business.\n\nBut the Ravens defense stiffened at the right time, sacking Wilson with defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike delivering a crunching sack on a third-down play to force a punt as the third quarter came to an end.\n\nThe Ravens went back to their tough ground game to eat up some more clock before punting the ball back to the Steelers midway through the quarter.\n\nA nice return from Calvin Austin III put the ball at the Steelers 25-yard line with 8:36 to go in the game and Pittsburgh needing two touchdowns. An appearance from Ravens legend Ray Lewis got the fans hyped up before the critical drive, a must-score sequence for the Steelers.\n\nAnother big pass from Russell Wilson to Pickens, this one for 26 yards to move the ball to the Baltimore 38-yard line, put the Steelers in a threatening position. Having found no luck on the ground, the Steelers have turned almost exclusively to the deep pass in the second half as their offensive threat and found success.\n\nBut the thing about those pass plays is that they need time to develop. Another sack, this one from Odafe Oweh, put the Steelers in a tough position. Left with a fourth-and-15 play, Wislon went over the top again into triple coverage in the end zone. The pass was knocked down by Ar\u2019Darius Washington, turning the ball back over to the Ravens offense.\n\nThe combination of Jackson and Henry took the ball right into the teeth of the Steeler defense and found success. Jackson picked up a big first down on a third-and-short to keep the drive moving near midfield, and \u2013 not for the first time in the game \u2013 came looking like he was in some pain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the Ravens way too,\u201d Harbaugh said of the tough style of football played on Saturday. \u201cI think if you look back, you look at Baltimore, you know, since 2000 \u2026 it\u2019s been the run, defense, special teams. But Lamar\u2019s added a little flavor to that whole thing and we\u2019re throwing the ball well too.\u201d\n\nA defensive holding penalty on the Steelers gave the Ravens a free first down with a little more than three minutes to go. One play later, a sweep to Henry nearly picked up another as the running back powered for eight yards and only just was stopped from taking it to the house.\n\nBaltimore Ravens safety Ar'Darius Washington (29) breaks up a pass against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth quarter in an AFC wild card game at M&T Bank Stadium. Mitch Stringer/USA Today Sports/Reuters\n\nInstead, the Ravens just picked up one more crucial third down on a direct snap to tight end Mark Andrews and were able to take a knee to ice it.\n\nIf the Ravens continue to block and run the way they did on Saturday night, it\u2019s hard to find a defense in the NFL that\u2019s going to be able to stop them.\n\nThere was little back-patting in the locker room after the game as the Ravens looked forward to Sunday\u2019s slate of games and figuring out whether they\u2019ll play at home or on the road next week, but to Jackson it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t matter. We\u2019ve been on the road all season, we ready,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWith the start of the new year, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by unrealistic goals and fitness trends.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to follow those fads. Research shows that even a short amount of walking \u2014 one of the most accessible forms of exercise \u2014 can help set you up for success when working toward other fitness achievements.\n\nResearch shows that 11 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day may lower your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or premature death. Does that sound like too much to start? Even as little as five minutes of walking per day could provide some health benefits, according to Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.\n\nJust getting started\n\nFreeman recommends aiming for 30 minutes of daily exercise, ideally brisk walking paired with weightlifting to create a high-intensity training program. But he said he knows that a structured workout of that length isn\u2019t always feasible, especially for those in the early stages of their fitness journey.\n\nThe key is to make movement a regular part of your day, which is why Freeman suggests people engage in any form of exercise, even if it\u2019s incorporating a five-minute walk into your routine.\n\nKaty Milkman, James G. Dinan Professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, explains that making bite-size goals is essential for creating momentum for larger resolutions.\n\nPsychologically, smaller tasks are easier to achieve, so pushing yourself to take a five-minute daily walk is easier than trying to complete a 35-minute walk once, Milkman said.\n\nEven with a five-minute walk, the most important part of any fitness goal, according to Freeman, is finding time to weave it into your daily routine, which is why it\u2019s important to start small and focus on simplicity.\n\nFor some, doing so might be as basic as parking farther away when heading to the gym or mall to increase your step count. If you\u2019re in a parking garage, it can also be a good idea to take the stairs to increase your heart rate, Freeman said.\n\nWhen making plans, CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, suggests asking friends to go for a walk instead of meeting for dinner or drinks.\n\nFreeman also recommends completing your quick walk \u2014 or whatever form of exercise brings you joy \u2014 first thing in the morning to start your day with positive movement. And for coffee lovers, Freeman said a walk can energize you just as effectively as one cup of your favorite brew.\n\nWhen it comes to forming a new routine, it\u2019s important not to make excuses, especially when trying to get steps in during the winter months.\n\n\u201cMost malls open their doors early (before the actual stores open) to let walkers get their steps in by doing laps around the interior levels of the mall,\u201d Santas said via email.\n\nWalking isn\u2019t just good for your body; it\u2019s also great for your mental well-being. Not only can it help break addictions such as smoking, Freeman said, but a walk can also help reduce anxiety and depression, especially for people who might be dealing with grief.\n\nWhile the holiday season is over, walking is also a good way to decompress from family gatherings and celebration stressors.\n\nBuilding on your routine\n\nTo increase the difficulty of daily walks, experts recommend adding weights for resistance and walking quickly enough to be out of breath. Sorrasak Jar Tinyo/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nAs confidence in your walking routine grows, you should aim to increase the intensity and length of your workout. Freeman suggests focusing on exercises that make you \u201chuff and puff\u201d for the most noticeable health benefits.\n\n\u201cYou see these people (at the gym) do a couple of reps, chat, take a rest and have a drink,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou really want to keep going for 20 or 30 minutes straight.\u201d\n\nCombining weight training and cardio is a beneficial way to include both elements in your daily routine.\n\nBased on how the activities work different parts of your body, Freeman said he likes to explain cardio as a short-term investment in your health, while weight training is a long-term one because of how metabolically active people\u2019s muscles are.\n\nTo include weight training on your walk, Freeman recommends eventually adding a weighted backpack to your routine. If you want to keep it simple, use any backpack you have at home, and fill it with old books to load it down.\n\nOther ideas might include wearing wrist, arm, shoulder, ankle or leg weights to create resistance for an additional challenge.\n\n\u201cIf (people) can keep this (routine) up for usually two to three weeks, it becomes a habit (they) want to keep doing,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nLike any other form of exercise, taking the time to practice and perfect your walking form can improve the safety and efficacy of your workouts, according to Santas, and it\u2019s a simple way to challenge yourself.\n\nFor people who want to incorporate longer walks into their daily or weekly routine, Freeman recommends walking with others to make the experience more enjoyable.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have people in your corner to join you, programs such as Walk With a Doc offer free community walks guided by physicians to create a casual and supportive environment for people to work on their healthy habits together.\n\nSolo exercisers might find personal motivation with an engaging podcast or audiobook as well as a guided meditation to make their walks feel effortless.\n\n\u201cIf you get really into a story \u2026 you could probably walk an entire park, end up right where you started, and not even know you did it,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the smaller the commitment, the more likely you are to follow through, Milkman said. As you add more to your routine, start slow and think about where you might be able to squeeze some quick yet beneficial movements into your practice.\n\nFor those just starting to incorporate more exercise into their routine, it\u2019s all about sitting less and moving more. Some workouts can even be completed from the comfort of your couch while watching an episode of your favorite TV show, Santas said via email.\n\nAre you ready to do more?

            "title": "Forget crunches: The smarter way to strengthen your core",
            "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Dana Santas, known as the \u201cMobility Maker,\u201d is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book \u201cPractical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.\u201d\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, when you hear the word core, you probably think of six-pack abs. But your core is so much more than that \u2014 it\u2019s the powerhouse that stabilizes, supports and moves you through life.\n\nDespite its central role in your body\u2019s physical function, the core is often misunderstood and poorly targeted in workouts. Many people focus on achieving a sculpted appearance while neglecting other critical aspects such as mobility and stability. A truly healthy core is about function \u2014 not just form \u2014 supporting your body in accomplishing both daily tasks and athletic feats.\n\nWhether you want better balance, more powerful movements, or fewer backaches and injuries in the new year or any time of year, your core holds the key. Read on to learn why core health matters and how to train your core effectively.\n\nWhat is your core?\n\nYour core is an interconnected group of muscles that includes all your abs \u2014 not just your rectus abdominis, the long vertical muscle that can appear as a visible six-pack in people with low body fat. And because your core wraps around the entire midsection of your body, it also includes your side waist, pelvic floor and lower back muscles as well as your diaphragm, your primary respiratory muscle that runs from your rib cage to your lumbar spine. Together, these muscles form a fundamental support system, enabling nearly every move you make and every breath you take.\n\nThe core\u2019s role in movement\n\nAs a mobility coach in professional sports, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how core integration is essential for nearly every physical action. Your core isn\u2019t just along for the ride \u2014 it\u2019s the driver, ensuring strength, stability and efficiency in movement.\n\nWhether you\u2019re walking, lifting or playing a sport, your core plays a pivotal role in your body\u2019s key functions. Here\u2019s how:\n\nStabilization and balance: Your core stabilizes your spine and pelvis and influences rib cage position, creating a foundation for posture and movement. This stability is crucial not only for athletic performance but also for ensuring the ability to maintain neutral posture and balance to prevent injuries. For example, standing on one leg or walking on an uneven surface both rely on your core to keep you upright and stable.\n\nMovement in all directions: While stability is crucial, your core also needs to be mobile. Imagine twisting to grab something from your car\u2019s back seat or reaching into your grocery cart to place items on the checkout conveyor belt \u2014 both movements require core mobility. A stiff or inflexible core can limit your range of motion and increase your risk of injury. I see this limitation lead to injury all too often in rotational athletes when they focus too much on anterior core strengthening and not enough on mobilization.\n\nPower transmission: Whether you\u2019re throwing a football, swinging a golf club or sprinting, your core allows for the efficient expression of power through your limbs. Without a stable core, this power transfer is less effective, putting more stress on your joints, which can lead to compensation and overuse injuries, especially for athletes. In my experience, this is a common cause for tennis elbow.\n\nThe plank: A foundational core exercise\n\nCrunches have a long-standing history as the gold standard of ab exercises. But, unlike crunches, which isolate your rectus abdominis, planks activate your entire core, from your deep stabilizing muscles to your obliques and lower back.\n\nHow to do a basic plank\n\nMobility coach Dana Santas demonstrates the straight-arm plank, without modifications, which works the entire core. Aaron Lockwood\n\n1. Start on your hands and knees with your wrists aligned under your shoulders.\n\nGaze slightly ahead of your hands to keep your neck in a neutral position.\n\n2. Step your feet back one at a time, straightening your legs to create a diagonal line from your head to your hips and down to your heels.\n\n3. Engage your core by exhaling and moving your ribs back and down toward your waist. Avoid letting your hips sag or back arch.\n\n4. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds to start, maintaining a deep, even breathing pattern. Rest for 10 to 15 seconds in between reps and repeat two to three times. Gradually increase the duration of holds as your strength improves.\n\nIf a traditional straight-arm plank is too taxing on your wrists or shoulders, modify with a forearm plank by putting your forearms down with your elbows aligned under your shoulders. Likewise, if having your legs straight is too difficult, drop down to your knees.\n\nPlank variations add well-rounded benefits\n\nAlmost every exercise imaginable requires core activation to be safe and effective, but the plank stands out as a foundational core exercise because it not only enables full core muscle activation but also provides a base for variation to increase emphasis on specific areas and benefits. Adding dynamic movements \u2014 such as shoulder taps or mountain climbers \u2014 emphasizes integrated strength and mobility, while variations, such as a side plank, target your obliques and challenge your balance.\n\nOne of my favorite side plank dynamic progressions is adding a reach-and-rotate movement, which covers the bases of stability, mobility and strength. To perform this, from a side plank, reach your top arm under your body as if threading a needle, then rotate it back upward toward the ceiling.\n\nNo matter what variants of plank you choose or other core-focused exercises, always round out your core training with mobility exercises that rotate and stretch your core in all directions. You can easily accomplish this with some basic yoga twists and bends.\n\nCore health for everyday life\n\nA well-functioning core is not just for athletes. It\u2019s essential for everyone.\n\nBut building a healthy core does not mean spending hours in the gym. You can build a stronger, more resilient core with a few minutes of targeted exercises a few times a week.\n\nBy practicing a mix of static holds, dynamic exercises and rotational movements, such as those mentioned above, over time, you will notice improvements not just in your core strength, but in how you move, perform and feel in everyday life.\n\nWant to build on your core strength in 2025?

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMary Young was sitting in the kitchen of a guesthouse in Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach when a spontaneous flip of a coin dictated the rest of her life.\n\nIt was May 29, 1976. Mary was 21 and visiting Australia on a working vacation from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nMary had arrived at the rundown guesthouse in Bondi Beach a few weeks earlier, with her friend Brenda, a fellow Canadian, in tow. The two women were ready to enjoy the area\u2019s sandy shores, laid-back atmosphere and soak up Sydney for the next few months.\n\nNot long after her arrival, Mary was sitting on the porch of the guesthouse when she spotted two young guys approaching the building. Mary zeroed in on one of them, who was wearing a short-sleeved black T-shirt and blue jeans. He looked over at her as he walked past, smiling.\n\n\u201cI watched him walking up the sidewalk, and I thought, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a nice-looking guy,\u2019\u201d Mary tells CNN Travel today.\n\nFast-forward to the moment Mary was sitting in the guesthouse kitchen, drinking a cup of tea with Brenda. In walked another resident, and Mary recognized him as the friend of the guy in the black tee. He introduced himself as Kenny and asked if they wanted to join him at the pub that evening.\n\nMary and Brenda hesitated. They hadn\u2019t found jobs in Sydney yet, and they were starting to run low on cash.\n\n\u201cSo we said we didn\u2019t have enough money for both of us to go to the pub,\u201d recalls Mary.\n\nKenny thought about this for a moment, then suggested one of them should still come \u2014 they could flip a coin to figure out who\u2019d go and who\u2019d stay behind.\n\nMary picked heads, Brenda picked tails. Kenny dug out a coin from his pocket.\n\n\u201cThen he flipped the coin, and my girlfriend won,\u201d says Mary. \u201cSo she went to the pub with Kenny and I stayed in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Mary felt a bit deflated. The Saturday night stretched ahead of her with no plans and no company.\n\nBut then, to her surprise, into the kitchen walked the guy in the black tee, Kenny\u2019s friend. He greeted Mary, introducing himself as Wayne Corlett from New Zealand.\n\nMary\u2019s mood instantly shifted.\n\n\u201cWayne came in,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was an instant attraction. And that was the beginning of everything.\u201d\n\nBonding in Bondi Beach\n\nMary and Wayne met while staying in Bondi Beach in Australia, pictured here in the 1970s: \"It was a pretty cool place to meet,\" says Mary. AP\n\nLike Mary, Wayne Corlett was also on a working vacation in Sydney in 1976 \u2014 though he hadn\u2019t traveled as far.\n\nWayne and his friend Kenny had recently finished apprenticeships in New Zealand, turned 21 and decided to embark on an adventure together.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to go to Australia, live in Bondi, do some surfing and live on the beach,\u201d Wayne tells CNN Travel today. \u201cOur plan was to maybe spend the year there, save as much money as we could, and then just hang around Australia and have a good time with the money that we saved.\u201d\n\nBefore they left New Zealand, Wayne and Kenny made a pact \u201cnot to meet any girls\u201d \u2014 or at least none that would become significant and could derail their plans.\n\nBut when Wayne walked into the kitchen and started chatting with Mary, \u201cthat was it,\u201d as Wayne puts it.\n\n\u201cWe just got to talking,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNext day, I think we went for a walk together around the beaches, and it was a relationship from then on. It just felt right.\u201d\n\nWhen Mary caught up with Brenda the next day, she couldn\u2019t stop gushing about Wayne. She told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to marry this guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I had never thought about marriage until that point, ever, ever,\u201d says Mary.\n\nOver the next few days, as they walked along Bondi Beach, hand in hand, Mary and Wayne bonded over a shared love of traveling and adventure. They talked about their respective upbringings on opposite sides of the world, both keen to hear one another\u2019s perspective on life.\n\n\u201cI was fascinated by Wayne\u2019s family, he came from a very large family. I was an only child and my dad died when I was 12, so that was a huge draw for me,\u201d says Mary. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do any small talk. We didn\u2019t do any of that sort of stuff \u2014 just launched right into a full-scale relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just felt right,\u201d says Wayne. \u201cAnd things just moved along smoothly.\u201d\n\nWithin a few weeks, Mary got a clerical job in Sydney. Wayne was also busy working in a butcher shop. In between shifts, the two spent all their free time together.\n\n\u201cBondi Beach, it was a pretty cool place to meet,\u201d says Mary. \u201cGoing to the beach, going for walks\u2026 Occasionally we would go to a movie. We never went out for dinner ever, it just wasn\u2019t in the budget.\u201d\n\nMary and Wayne never confirmed they were officially dating. It was just obvious they wanted to be together. And within a month or so, the two had moved out of the guesthouse and into an apartment together.\n\nA decisive moment\n\nMary initially only planned to stay in Australia for six months. After meeting and falling for Wayne, she extended her visa. Courtesy Mary Corlett\n\nMary\u2019s Australian visa was initially only set to last six months, but she ended up staying for a year.\n\n\u201cI extended my working visa because I wanted to be with Wayne, and I wanted to stay in Australia.\u201d\n\nIn letters back home to her mother in Canada, Mary wrote about Wayne and their life together in Sydney.\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019d met someone that I was really fond of,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAnd, as Christmas 1976 approached, Mary\u2019s mother arranged to visit for three weeks. She got along with Wayne right away, finding him funny and charming.\n\n\u201cI think my mom liked him better than she liked me most of the time,\u201d says Mary, laughing.\n\nAfter a year of working and living together in Australia, Mary and Wayne packed up their life in Sydney to embark on a three-month stint traveling around the country together. Before they embarked in a station wagon, the two went to New Zealand so Mary could meet Wayne\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come out and say anything\u2019s going to be long-term. We didn\u2019t talk about that. But we were making travel plans and thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll go back and see Wayne\u2019s family,\u2019\u201d recalls Mary. \u201cWe must have known we were pretty serious then.\u201d\n\nThe couple stayed at Wayne\u2019s parents\u2019 place for a week, where Mary was welcomed into the loud, loving family. She felt instantly at home and embraced by his crowd of siblings.\n\n\u201cThen we traveled around Australia for a few months,\u201d she recalls.\n\nUp until that point, Mary and Wayne\u2019s relationship had been smooth sailing \u2014 they never seemed to disagree, or find points of contention. But traveling together got off to a rocky start.\n\n\u201cThere were the odd arguments and disagreements,\u201d recalls Wayne.\n\nThey were both strong characters, Wayne suggests, and it was sometimes a bit of \u201cpower struggle\u201d between them.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember one time we had a pretty bad argument.\u201d\n\nThis disagreement took place in Townsville, Australia. In the middle of the blowup, Wayne found himself thinking this was a \u201cmake-or-break moment.\u201d Either he and Mary would work to make it work, or they\u2019d each go their own way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to decide,\u201d he thought. \u201cDo I want to keep this relationship going, or do I want to leave?\u201d\n\nThe answer, he realized, was obvious. There was no question, really.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave her. I wanted to stay with her. So that\u2019s when I decided to ask Mary to marry me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was a little bit dumbstruck then, because we were in the middle of an argument, and then he suggested marriage,\u201d says Mary. \u201cI thought, \u2018Whoa, where\u2019s this going? We were just fighting a minute ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Mary knew, instantly, that her answer was yes. She\u2019d known since the first night she and Wayne bonded in the guesthouse in Bondi Beach.\n\nFrom backpacking to putting down roots\n\nAfter exploring Australia, Mary and Wayne went on to backpack through Southeast Asia.\n\n\u201cWe flew from Perth to Bali and then travelled by local buses and trains all through Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey\u2026\u201d recalls Mary.\n\nIt was an amazing experience.\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019d made the decision that we were going to get married, things smoothed out quite a bit,\u201d says Wayne. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any arguing after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Asia trip was a highlight as there were hardly any tourists back then, especially the way we were travelling. We did all local trains and buses and never spent more than $1 a night on accommodation. Probably another highlight was the Taj Mahal. We went at sunrise and we were the only ones there,\u201d says Mary.\n\nThroughout the trip, Mary and Wayne were also thinking ahead to their wedding and imagining their future together.\n\nFor a while, they considered getting married in the UK, as a middle ground, of sorts.\n\n\u201cBut my mother really wanted me to come home and get married. So that\u2019s what we did. We came back to Vancouver, and we got married in December \u201877,\u201d says Mary.\n\nAs Wayne wasn\u2019t a Canadian citizen, he wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the country until 30 days before the wedding.\n\nThat whole period was a bit of a whirlwind, and Mary says she didn\u2019t have \u201cmuch time to reflect\u201d on how her life was changing.\n\n\u201cI came home broke, with no job, about to get married, had to find a place to live\u2026 I don\u2019t remember really thinking too much, because we were just so busy.\u201d\n\nMary had been away from Canada for almost two years. In between wedding planning and apartment hunting, she caught up with old friends, some of whom were skeptical about the upcoming marriage.\n\n\u201cA few friends said to me it was never going to last with a guy from another country,\u201d Mary recalls.\n\nBut Mary felt marrying Wayne was the right choice. She was sure it would work. And while there were naysayers, most of Mary and Wayne\u2019s loved ones supported their decision.\n\n\u201cEverybody could see that we had a good relationship, right from the very beginning, that it wasn\u2019t going to be a fly-by-night,\u201d says Mary. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d come home without Wayne, ever. I didn\u2019t know if I would come home, but whatever I did, wherever I went, I was going to be with Wayne.\u201d\n\nTechnically, Mary did go home without Wayne \u2014 but that was only for visa reasons, and only for a short while. Wayne joined her in Vancouver as soon as he could. After he and Mary parted ways in India, Wayne spent the next month making his way to Canada.\n\n\u201cI traveled through Pakistan, Afghanistan overland. I met a couple of guys in Afghanistan from Italy who gave me a lift to Italy from Afghanistan and made my way to London,\u201d recalls Wayne.\n\n\u201cI caught a flight from London to New York, so spent a couple of nights at the airport in New York and then flew to Canada.\u201d\n\nWhen Wayne arrived, Mary introduced him to her Vancouver friendship circle. None of Wayne\u2019s friends were going to make it from New Zealand to Canada for the wedding, and Mary wanted him to get to know her pals \u2014 and there were bigger implications at play.\n\n\u201cHe had to find a best man,\u201d recalls Mary. \u201cSo I introduced him to my friends\u2019 boyfriends, and I said, \u2018Pick one for your best man.\u2019 Because he didn\u2019t know anybody here in Canada at all, nobody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do that, because I thought, \u2018Well, I want to find my own at least,\u2019\u201d recalls Wayne.\n\nHe told Mary: \u201cI\u2019m just going to go down to the pub. I\u2019ll meet somebody, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Look, you know, do you want to be best man?\u2019\u201d\n\nMary told Wayne this \u201cwas not going to fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, that\u2019s not going to work. We\u2019re not having someone from the pub,\u2019\u201d says Mary.\n\nFortunately, Wayne quickly made friends with Mary\u2019s friends\u2019 boyfriends \u2014 and one of them in particular.\n\n\u201cWe ended up hitting it off pretty well,\u201d Wayne recalls. \u201cSo I asked him, and he agreed. And it worked out well, we still see each other today. We play pickleball together in the summertime two or three times a week.\u201d\n\nThe wedding was a great celebration at a church in Vancouver. On the day, Mary and Wayne felt excited about beginning a new chapter together \u2014 though they didn\u2019t initially expect to stay in Canada long-term.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were just going to come home temporarily and work and get some money together,\u201d says Mary, who took Wayne\u2019s last name when they got married, becoming Mary Corlett. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any firm plans, but I think we thought that we were going to do some more traveling. But by eight months married, I was pregnant.\u201d\n\nNavigating life\u2019s ups and downs\n\nMary on their wedding day in December 1977 in Vancouver, Canada. Courtesy Mary Corlett\n\nMary and Wayne\u2019s first child was born on May 29, 1979, the three year anniversary of the day the couple met in Sydney. It felt like fate.\n\nMary and Wayne were excited to welcome a child. Wayne was from a big family and loved the idea of raising his own, while Mary had spent her sibling-less childhood fantasizing about the idea of a large, rambunctious household.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting,\u201d says Mary of becoming a parent. \u201cWe were very young, so we had no idea about bringing up children. We were the first amongst our friends to have a baby, so there was not even anyone to ask for any advice, but we just quickly morphed into a routine, like every family does.\u201d\n\nWayne and Mary went on to have four kids in total, bringing their family up in British Columbia. They were happy to be close to Mary\u2019s mother, and visited New Zealand every few years. On two occasions, they moved their family there for a longer stint, enrolling their kids in local schools to give them a taste of life in their father\u2019s home country.\n\n\u201cI thought that we should do it and give the kids an opportunity to experience life down there,\u201d says Mary.\n\nBack in Canada, Mary and Wayne started working together. At first they ran gas stations together, and later they owned three branches of the coffee and donut franchise Tim Hortons.\n\nThe couple strove to protect their private time at home, even when their shared job proved challenging.\n\n\u201cWe never talked about work at home \u2014 that was something we decided when the kids were young. We always said, \u2018We don\u2019t talk about work at home, over dinner or anything like that,\u2019\u201d says Mary.\n\nFor some years before her death, Mary\u2019s mother also lived with the couple.\n\n\u201cWayne was very kind and patient with my mom,\u201d says Mary. \u201cWayne is super respectful.\u201d\n\nBetween juggling family life, bringing up four kids, working together and life\u2019s ups and downs, Mary and Wayne went through some tougher times. But they remained committed to each other and their life together.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re both the type that are not going to give up easily, are going to make it work,\u201d says Mary.\n\n49 years later\n\nWayne and Mary are now in their late 60s and are enjoying spending their retirement traveling. Courtesy Mary Corlett\n\nToday, Mary and Wayne are about to turn 70, retired and enjoying life in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a real legacy now, with 13 grandkids and four kids that are all doing well and launched,\u201d says Mary. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see everyone is content and happy, they seem to be, and it all started from us.\u201d\n\nMary and Wayne\u2019s family members, who live close by, enjoy hearing the story of how Mary and Wayne met by chance in the guesthouse on Bondi Beach \u2014 even if the younger family members can\u2019t quite visualize it.\n\n\u201cThe grandkids, they can\u2019t imagine us ever being 21 years old,\u201d says Mary, laughing.\n\nSince retiring, Mary and Wayne have also re-embraced the spirit of adventure that bonded them together back in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to all continents except Antarctica,\u201d says Mary. \u201cWe just got back from Morocco and southern Spain. And we\u2019ve still got places that we want to go and see \u2014 we\u2019re not finished yet.\u201d\n\nThe couple celebrate 49 years together this year \u2014 and in 2026 they\u2019re planning to return to Australia to celebrate five decades since they first met. They\u2019re going to hunt out the old guesthouse in Bondi Beach and retrace the steps of their younger selves.\n\nReflecting on almost 50 years together, Mary says \u201cit\u2019s really comfortable being with someone that\u2019s known you all your life, since you were 21 years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really sort of grown up together,\u201d she says.\n\nMary adds she feels \u201cincredibly lucky\u201d and \u201cgrateful to find someone who values me enough that he wants to spend the rest of his time with me.\u201d\n\nWayne says he feels similarly thankful.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think back to when we first met, and then here\u2019s this woman I met and married, and now we have four children,\u201d says Wayne. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nBoth Wayne and Mary also find it surreal to consider how they grew up on opposite sides of the world, then unexpectedly came together at 21 and have lived a whole life together since, side by side.\n\n\u201cWhat are the chances of the stars aligning?\u201d says Mary, \u201cWhat if I had won the bet and gone to the pub with Kenny? I never would have had that dinner with Wayne. I feel incredibly lucky that it happened the way it did. I always say I lost a bet and I won Wayne \u2014 I lost a coin toss and I won a husband.\u201d",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nAn international research team has successfully drilled and retrieved a 9,186-foot-long (2,800-meter-long) ice core from Antarctica that dates back 1.2 million years. The sample extended so deep that it reached the bedrock beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n\nThe core, nearly as long as 25 soccer fields end to end or six and a half times taller than the Empire State Building to the very tip of its antenna, is a \u201ctime machine\u201d that captures \u201can extraordinary archive of Earth\u2019s climate,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, coordinator of the Beyond EPICA, or European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica, team that collected the core.\n\nThe team has sliced the core into 3.2-foot (1-meter) pieces stored in insulated boxes so they may be studied, said Barbante, professor at Italy\u2019s Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice and senior associate member of the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy.\n\nThe core was collected from Little Dome C, one of the harshest and most extreme locations on the planet. The site is 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the Italian-French Concordia research station and is constantly slammed with strong wind gusts and near-constant temperatures below minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe ice, some of the oldest drilled on Earth, could provide answers to the biggest remaining questions about how the planet\u2019s climate has changed over time.\n\n\u201cThe air bubbles trapped within the ice core provide a direct snapshot of past atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gas concentrations like carbon dioxide and methane,\u201d Barbante said via email. \u201cBy analyzing these, we can reconstruct how Earth\u2019s climate responded to changes in climate forcing factors, such as solar radiation, volcanic activity, and orbital variations. This data helps us understand the intricate relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature over hundreds of thousands of years and now down to 1.2 million year(s) and hopefully beyond.\u201d\n\nScientists are also hoping the ice will shed light on what caused the timing of Earth\u2019s ice ages to shift suddenly about 1 million years ago, an event that nearly caused the extinction of ancient human ancestors, according to recent research.\n\nThe ice core slices are stored in an Antarctic cave until they can be shipped to other institutions for analysis. PNRA/IPEV\n\nAn icy milestone\n\nResearchers collected the core during the fourth campaign of the Beyond EPICA \u2014 Oldest Ice project, funded by the European Commission. The campaign took place over the most recent Antarctic summer between mid-November to mid-January. Overall, experts from 12 European scientific institutions have spent more than 200 days drilling and processing the ice during the last four summers.\n\nThe program builds on the goals of the initial EPICA project that took place from 1996 to 2008. During that time, researchers drilled a deep ice core that unearthed links between climate and atmospheric greenhouse gases over the past 800,000 years. The core collected during the latest campaign marks a new milestone, creating a continuous record of Earth\u2019s climate that dates back even further.\n\nStudies of the original EPICA core showed that Earth\u2019s climate experienced a 100,000-year cycle of cold glacial periods, or ice ages, interspersed with warmer periods. But this finding didn\u2019t match up with marine sediments that revealed Earth once experienced 41,000-year glacial periods prior to 1 million years ago.\n\nThe Beyond EPICA project began in 2016 with the goal of finding older ice that could point to why this shift occurred, and the search for the right site started with the use of radar surveys.\n\nRadio echo sounding technologies helped team members zero in on ice that might contain the time capsule they were looking for, said Frank Wilhelms, principal investigator in the field and joint professor at G\u00f6ttingen University and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.\n\n\u201cWe needed a Goldilocks site \u2014 ice thick enough for a well-resolved climate record at the greatest depth, but not too thick that the oldest ice had already melted away,\u201d said Dr. Robert Mulvaney, a glaciologist and paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey.\n\nAn aerial view shows the remote Little Dome C site in Antarctica where an international team drilled the ancient ice sample. PNRA/IPEV\n\n\u201cThis can happen when the heat escaping from the Earth\u2019s mantle is trapped by a thick insulating blanket of ice. If the ice is too thick, we can lose the lowest and oldest layers of ice to melting,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we spent a lot of effort in surveying the candidate areas to find the right site before drilling started.\u201d\n\nLittle Dome C is high on the central Antarctic plateau, reaching an altitude of 10,498 feet (3,200 meters) above sea level, presenting numerous challenges. The team had to work to prevent drill failures and ensure that the electromechanical core drill was progressing through the ice layers. Each meter of ice can contain as many as 13,000 years of climate data, said Julien Westhoff, chief scientist in the field and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\nInsights from ancient ice\n\nWhen the team members retrieved the core, they found what they were looking for. The bottommost 688 feet (210 meters) of the core above the bedrock consists of old ice that has been heavily deformed, likely mixed, refrozen and of unknown origin, the team said.\n\nParticles and air bubbles trapped in the deepest part of the ice core could reveal what Earth's climate was like 1.2 million years ago. PNRA/IPEV\n\nAnalyzing the ice could help to test theories about how it refroze beneath the ice sheet. Researchers will also determine whether even older ice, such as that from the pre-Quaternary Period 2.58 million years ago, is present and provide dating of the rocks beneath the ice to determine when this Antarctic region was last ice-free.\n\n\u201cIt was exciting to see the ice age as we drilled deeper, and especially when we knew we were drilling ice older than the EPICA record, which ended at 800,000 years ago,\u201d the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s Mulvaney said in a statement. \u201cThis record of 1.2 million years will give us several 41,000-year glacial cycles to compare with the more recent data from the original EPICA core.\u201d\n\nThe Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which occurred between 1.2 million and 900,000 years ago, marks the fundamental shift in Earth\u2019s glacial cycles, Barbante said.\n\n\u201cThis transition remains a scientific mystery, particularly regarding the role of greenhouse gases and ice sheet dynamics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Beyond EPICA ice core offers an unprecedented opportunity to directly measure atmospheric conditions during this pivotal period, potentially unlocking answers about why this transition occurred and how it shaped our planet\u2019s climate system.\u201d\n\nDuring the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, ice ages became longer and more intense, leading to a drop in temperature and dry climatic conditions. The global population also dropped to about 1,280 reproducing individuals between 930,000 and 813,000 years ago and then remained that small for about 117,000 years, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Science. The study authors argue this event \u201cbrought human ancestors close to extinction,\u201d but others are more skeptical.\n\nRegardless, the ice core could contain evidence as to why the shift in the length of ice age periods occurred.\n\nThe team lived, slept, ate and worked 24 hours a day in shifts in the heated drilling tent at the site. PNRA/IPEV\n\nSomething in the air (bubbles)\n\nIce cores contain layers of snowfall that have been compressed over time, trapping air bubbles and particles that can be analyzed to reveal how Earth\u2019s temperature and atmosphere have shifted.\n\nThey could help scientists understand how Earth\u2019s climate has behaved in the past to better predict how things may change in the future \u2014 and provide context on how our planet responds to different greenhouse gas concentrations.\n\n\u201cAntarctic ice cores are like Rosetta Stones,\u201d said Jim White, Craver Family Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an email. \u201cThey are unique in that they speak the language of temperature as well as the language of (carbon dioxide) levels, allowing us to see how these two key climate variables interact.\u201d\n\nWhite was not involved in retrieving the ice core. But he said the ice has the potential to yield a great deal of information \u201cabout the fundamental dynamics of climate change on our planet, and the importance of that cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nWhile preliminary analysis occurred at the site, the ice core slices will be transported back to Europe aboard the icebreaker ship Laura Bassi in specialized cold containers to maintain the perfect temperature. Barbante anticipates that the research will be a multiyear endeavor as scientists take a deep dive into measuring concentrations of gas and dust particles within the ice.\n\nMeanwhile, the Beyond EPICA project, as well as other international associations, will search for older ice that could reveal longer climate records. But such efforts will require more advanced technology and planning, Barbante said.\n\n\u201cWe have to find other places in Antarctica where we can retrieve continuous climate record(s) similar to the one we are studying,\u201d he said.",

Its native habitat, the Atlantic rainforest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, has been reduced to just over 7% of its original size. Of that, 80% is highly fragmented, and most patches are too small to support healthy golden lion tamarin populations. Alongside capture for the pet trade, this drove the species to the brink of extinction; by the 1970s as few as 200 individuals remained in the wild.\n\nHowever, through coordinated reintroduction programs, vaccination schemes and initiatives to reconnect fragmented habitats, the golden lion tamarin has made an impressive comeback.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFormer US Olympian Gary Hall Jr. won 10 Olympic medals and six world championship medals in his swimming career. He believes he\u2019s lost them all in the Palisades wildfire, he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett.\n\n\u201cI thought I had more time,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI saw the fire charging down the hill and knew that I had to get out of there. I opened up the back of my SUV, I loaded a painting, one other object.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was going back in from that run, hot embers were raining down from the sky. I knew at that point that I just didn\u2019t have much time. I could see the embers hitting the roofs of the houses around me and made that decision: it\u2019s time to go.\n\n\u201cThe medals were in a closet in my bedroom, 70 feet away, and I didn\u2019t have time to go get them.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nScientists have unearthed nearly 200 dinosaur footprints, dating back 166 million years to the Middle Jurassic Period, at Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nThe remarkable find, first spied in 2023 when quarry worker Gary Johnson sensed \u201cunusual bumps\u201d on the ground while extracting limestone for road construction, has been nicknamed the \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d as a nod to the extensive pathways left by these prehistoric creatures.\n\nWhile other Jurassic pathways have been documented globally, the recent \u201chighway\u201d discovery in Oxfordshire is the largest known dinosaur track site in the United Kingdom.\n\nAround 100 volunteers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford collaborated this past June for one week, excavating the tracks and recording as much information as possible about the expansive site.\n\nThe discovery holds particular significance as it aligns with the 200th anniversary of the first-ever described dinosaur, the Megalosaurus, which was found in Oxfordshire in 1824.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really long legacy in this area of exciting dinosaur tracks and body fossils,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropaleontology at the University of Birmingham in England who was involved with the excavation.\n\nA Dewars Farm artist constructed an image of the Megalosaurus (left) and Cetiosaurus (right) as imagined during the Middle Jurassic Period in what's now Oxfordshire, England. Mark Witton/University of Birmingham\n\nThe recently uncovered tracks connect to a previously discovered dinosaur path in the same Oxfordshire quarry back in 1997, but it\u2019s no longer accessible.\n\nHowever, with advancements in technology, the new trackways will provide scientists with an opportunity to analyze previously unavailable information about these extinct animals and unlock secrets about their movements, dietary habits and social dynamics.\n\nA prehistoric roadmap\n\nAerial drone photography captured in April 2024 shows the Oxfordshire \"dinosaur highway\" site before the excavation. University of Birmingham\n\nDuring the excavation, scientists uncovered five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous pathway measuring more than 150 meters in length (492 feet), according to a University of Birmingham news release.\n\nFour of these paths contained tracks from colossal, long-necked, four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs of the subgroup known as sauropods \u2014 most likely Cetiosaurus, which reached up to 18 meters (59 feet) in length, with the largest tracks measuring 90 centimeters (around 35 inches) long, according to Edgar.\n\nLawrence Tanner, a paleoecologist and professor of biological and environmental sciences at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York, likened sauropods to modern elephants due to their massive size and herbivorous diet. He explained that most of the tracks were from hind legs, noting that, similar to elephants, sauropods\u2019 hind feet were larger and often stepped over the impressions left by their front feet.\n\n\u201cThe general rule of locomotion is that the faster the animal is moving, the farther apart the footprints will be,\u201d Tanner, who was not involved in the excavation, said.\n\nThe fifth pathway contained prints from the Megalosaurus, a massive predatory dinosaur known for its distinctive, three-toed feet. Megalosaurus is believed to be up to 9 meters in length (30 feet), and in Oxfordshire, researchers found 65-centimeter (2.1-foot) long footprints.\n\nFrom the footprints, researchers were also able to determine the direction and speed at which the dinosaurs were moving. Most of the giants were moving northeast at an average speed of around 5 kilometers per hour (3 miles per hour), which is comparable to the pace of a human walking, Edgar said.\n\nScientists believe larger theropods, such as the Megalosaurus, lacked running capabilities, unlike their smaller theropod counterparts, which possibly had the ability to run at fast speeds. Tanner said this theropod seemed to be moving at a leisurely pace, as indicated by the footprints.\n\nResearchers noted that the Megalosaurus path intersected with the sauropod trackways, suggesting the predator moved through the area shortly after the herbivores.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint where the dinosaurs were headed, Tanner indicated they may have been traveling along the shoreline to navigate around trees or to search for food sources.\n\nIdeal preservation conditions\n\nSeveral volunteers work to examine the footprints uncovered throughout the Oxfordshire quarry in June 2024. Emma Nicholls/OUMNH\n\nThe preservation of such an expansive ancient trackway is rare and was made possible by the unique conditions of the land during this time frame of the Jurassic Period.\n\nThe distinct footprints indicate the area was once covered in soft sediment, with an ideal amount of water to conserve the impressions.\n\nEdgar compared the site\u2019s ancient environment to the Florida Keys, with its carbonate mud banks and nearby water source.\n\nThe tracks were also quickly covered, likely by a storm, protecting them from erosion caused by wind, water or other animals, according to Edgar.\n\nWhile Jurassic bone discoveries often draw significant attention, dinosaur tracks provide more specific insights into the lives of these extinct animals, Edgar said. Unlike bones, which can be transported to different areas by wind, water or scavengers, footprints remain in the exact locations where they were made.\n\nTracks not only indicate the size of the dinosaurs but also provide clues about their behavior, such as group dynamics and predator-prey interactions. If well-preserved, the impressions can also shed light on how these creatures reacted to environmental changes, according to Tanner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a snapshot into the day of the (dinosaurs\u2019) life, and what they were doing,\u201d Edgar said.\n\nPlanning future discoveries\n\nDuring a one-week excavation in June 2024, groups of volunteers gently remove debris from the dinosaur trackways to reveal the scale of many footprints. Caroline Wood/University of Oxford\n\nDuring the excavation, researchers captured more than 20,000 images of the footprints with aerial drone photography. The team will use these images to create detailed 3D models to further investigate the interactions and biomechanics of the dinosaurs.\n\nOver the next six months to a year, researchers will be working to quickly analyze the data collected and prepare to release their findings to the public.\n\n\u201cWe have these 3D models for the first time, which means that anyone, as soon as we publish them, will be able to see the site and (its) legacy,\u201d Edgar said.\n\nAs a result of the limited time researchers had to document the site to prevent further disruptions to the quarry site, Edgar noted that a large portion of the surface remains unexplored, potentially offering even more information about the diverse creatures that once roamed the area.\n\n\u201cAs quarrying continues, as long as we can, I think we\u2019ll be continuously evaluating and working with the quarry workers as new areas are exposed,\u201d Edgar said. \u201cWe would hope to be doing excavations each summer.\u201d",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTahlequah, the mother orca denoted as J35 who captured hearts worldwide in 2018 by carrying her dead calf for 17 days and over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), is once again displaying a similar act of mourning.\n\nHer newest calf, a female known as J61 to researchers, was first spotted on December 20 in the Puget Sound area on Washington state\u2019s northwest coast by members of the public. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later confirmed the sighting on December 23, according to Dr. Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research. Tragically, by New Year\u2019s Eve, the calf was confirmed dead, he said.\n\nResearchers have reported as of January 5 that Tahlequah is still carrying the calf, said Dr. Brad Hanson, a wildlife biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center of NOAA. Updates regarding the mother\u2019s activity with J61 may become limited as her family group, or pod, departs from its main Puget Sound base.\n\nTahlequah is constantly nudging the deceased calf\u2019s body, which weighs around 300 pounds (136 kilograms), with her snout to keep it close and prevent the ocean from pulling the carcass away.\n\n\u201cAs with last time, I think it\u2019s enough to recognize how strong the mother-calf bond is in killer whales (among the strongest social relationships in any animal), and to see that she is clearly not ready to let go,\u201d Weiss, whose doctoral research focused on orca social structure, said via email.\n\n\ufeffThe loss of a calf is not only devastating to Tahlequah but for the rapidly declining population of Southern Resident orcas, which is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 73 of the marine mammals remaining as of 2019.\n\nThe Southern Resident population is noted as \u201cone of the most critically endangered populations of marine mammals\u201d in the United States, according to researchers.\n\nDeep mourning by an orca mother\n\nSome female orcas have been known to carry their deceased offspring, but the time and distance Tahlequah has carried her two dead calves is unusual, according to experts. Candice Emmons/NOAA Fisheries\n\nThis act of grief raises concerns among researchers, including Weiss and Hanson, for its physical and emotional toll on Tahlequah as a member of the highly vulnerable Southern Resident population. Carrying the extra weight of the calf\u2019s body is both weighing down the mother and slowing her movements, which could impact her ability to forage for food.\n\nHowever, Weiss noted that during the orca\u2019s previous 17-day display of grief, there was no visible decline in her condition, which could signal that other members of her pod were helping her receive her food supply.\n\nWhile some female killer whales have been known to grieve the loss of their calves in ways similar to Tahlequah, the distance and time that she carried her newborn in 2018 made her an exception. Her current behavior, mirroring her past actions, is also unusual, according to Weiss.\n\nTahlequah is known to be the mother of another orca, J47, who is now around 14 years old, and also J57, a baby born two years after her 2018 loss.\n\nKiller whales typically reproduce every five years, giving the mother time to recover from the physical demands of pregnancy and giving birth, Hanson said.\n\nWhile no significant data are available to suggest why Tahlequah may have lost two calves within her lifetime, orca pregnancies are fraught with challenges. Nearly 70% of pregnancies in the Southern Resident orca population, which Tahlequah and her offspring belong to, result in spontaneous abortions or very early deaths, Weiss said.\n\nChallenges faced by Southern Resident orcas\n\nUnsuccessful pregnancies and struggles for survival within exclusively fish-eating killer whale communities in the northeast Pacific Ocean can be attributed to challenges from pollutants, noise, inbreeding and a lack of Chinook salmon, which is their primary food source, Weiss said.\n\nThe loss of a female calf like J61 is particularly harmful to the species\u2019 future because it diminishes the population\u2019s ability for reproduction.\n\n\u201cAssuming (orcas) live a full lifespan, you\u2019re looking at them producing five to six calves under ideal conditions, and part of the problem is that most of the females in this population have not produced that many viable calves,\u201d Hanson said.",

            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nTwo new potential strategies for returning crucial samples from Mars to Earth by the 2030s are now on the table, according to NASA.\n\nThe proposals present alternatives to the original Mars Sample Return program. Designed by NASA and the European Space Agency, the initial plan was deemed unwieldy after an independent review board projected it could cost up to $11 billion. The board\u2019s assessment also pushed the expected return date of the samples from 2031 to 2040 \u2014 a delay that was \u201csimply unacceptable,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson reiterated Tuesday.\n\nThe agency will decide between the newly proposed strategies, intended to reduce complexity, cost and mission duration, by the second half of 2026, Nelson announced during a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe NASA Perseverance rover has been gathering rocks and dust since it landed on Mars in February 2021. Scientists believe those samples \u2014 collected from Jezero Crater, the former site of an ancient lake and river delta \u2014 might be one of the only ways to determine whether life ever existed on the red planet.\n\nBut returning the specimens to Earth, a feat that could answer one of humanity\u2019s biggest questions about the potential for life beyond Earth, is a complex process. Both the original and new architecture for the program include multiple spacecraft that would be used to land on Mars and ferry the cache back to our planet.\n\nIn April, NASA asked its various centers and industry partners to come up with new plans for getting the samples back to Earth in a more streamlined and cost-effective way. The agency\u2019s Mars Sample Return Strategic Review team assessed 11 of the studies and made recommendations to NASA, which were then further refined by leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring two new landing options,\u201d said Dr. Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. \u201cOne is to leverage technology that was previously used to land both (the) Perseverance and Curiosity (rovers) on Mars. The other is to leverage options from industry.\u201d\n\nThe first option will rely on the sky crane method, used for the entry descent and landing of the two rovers still exploring Mars. The second will utilize new commercial capabilities and partners to deliver a \u201cheavy-lift vehicle\u201d lander, such as designs from companies from SpaceX and Blue Origin, to Mars, Nelson said.\n\nMars has long posed a challenge to landers because its thin atmosphere is thick enough to burn up a spacecraft that isn\u2019t tucked within an outer structure sporting a protective heat shield. But the red planet\u2019s atmosphere is also too thin to rely on parachutes alone to slow down and create a safe landing.\n\nFor the deployment of the hefty car-size rover Curiosity, engineers created a system called the sky crane to secure the rover during entry, descent and landing. During the initial descent, a heat shield, parachute and retrorockets slowed down the spacecraft.\n\nThen, the sky crane lowered the rover to the surface of the red planet using a strong cable. Afterward, the sky crane disconnected and crash-landed away from the site. In 2021, the same design was used to land Perseverance, and the team was actually able to capture video of the daring descent.\n\nAn illustration depicts the Perseverance rover landing safely on Mars using the sky crane. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nJourney from the Martian surface\n\nMars Sample Return is humanity\u2019s first mission to bring scientific samples from a habitable planet back to Earth, Fox said.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring those back as quickly as possible to study them in state-of-the-art facilities,\u201d she said. \u201cMars Sample Return will allow scientists to understand the planet\u2019s geological history and the evolution of climate on this barren planet where life may have existed in the past and shed light on the early solar system before life began here on Earth. This will also prepare us to safely send the first human explorers to Mars.\u201d\n\nThe agency will proceed with testing the viability of both options and working through the engineering challenges of each plan over the next year at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe newly proposed strategies provide the potential to return the samples to Earth as early as 2035, or as late as 2039, and with costs that range from $5.5 billion to $7.7 billion \u2014 a \u201cfar cry\u201d from the original figure, Nelson said.\n\n\u201cPursuing two potential paths forward will ensure that NASA is able to bring these samples back from Mars with significant cost and schedule saving compared to the previous plan,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThese samples have the potential to change the way we understand Mars, our universe, and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 ourselves.\u201d\n\nThis illustration for the original concept of Mars Sample Return shows multiple robots that would team up to ferry samples to Earth from the red planet. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nWhile both options are more streamlined than the original plan, they each contain similar architecture, which requires landing a Mars Ascent Vehicle on the Martian surface. That vehicle will be loaded with the samples collected by Perseverance, and then it will lift off, rendezvousing with the ESA\u2019s Earth Return Orbiter in orbit around Mars.\n\nThen, the orbiter will head back to Earth and drop off the sample capsule, similar to how rocks and dust from the asteroid Bennu were delivered by the OSIRIS-REX mission, Fox said.\n\nThere was no easy way to get rid of any single element of the original Mars Sample Return design, so the focus shifted to simplifying each piece, Fox said. For example, NASA opted for a direct return of the samples to Earth, rather than placing them in orbit around the moon, which would require another vehicle to go and fetch them, Nelson said. The biggest difference between each option will be the landing mechanism, Fox said.\n\nFor both strategies, the platform that will land on Mars will carry a smaller version of the Mars Ascent Vehicle than previously planned, and the platform\u2019s solar panels will be replaced with a system that can supply power and heat even during dust storms on Mars. This will enable the samples to be returned to Earth sooner, Fox said.\n\n\u201cWe are very confident that we can return all 30 samples before 2040 and for less than the $11 billion,\u201d Fox said.\n\nMars sample return: The path ahead\n\nTeams at JPL will focus on the engineering design for each plan at the same time over the next year, and one of the challenges will be making the sky crane 20% bigger than the one that landed Perseverance, Fox said. Another challenge is designing a Mars Ascent Vehicle that can survive landing on the red planet before launching from it.\n\nThe European Space Agency is currently evaluating NASA\u2019s new plans, according to NASA.\n\nUltimately, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration will be responsible for requesting an appropriate budget to support the program \u2014 and deciding whether they wish to continue with the program at all, Nelson added.\n\nNelson said he has not discussed the new Mars sample return proposals with Jared Isaacman, the tech billionaire and spaceflight trailblazer Trump has picked to helm NASA, because all discussions are being handled by the transition team, he said.\n\n\u201cBut I think it was a responsible thing to do to not hand the new administration just one alternative if they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can\u2019t imagine that they don\u2019t,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nPreviously, China has declared an interest in also returning samples from Mars. The country\u2019s Tianwen-3 mission might launch in 2028 to retrieve the Martian samples, which could be returned to Earth by 2031, although officials previously shared that they may also launch by 2030.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want the only sample return coming back on the Chinese spacecraft, and that\u2019s just simply a grab and go kind of mission,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWhereas ours has been a very methodical process \u2026 to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks, and when we bring back those 30 samples, it\u2019s going to give quite a history of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake. And the big question: Was there life millions of years ago?\u201d",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nExploring space has opened our eyes to numerous wonders, but these cosmic feats haven\u2019t come without challenges.\n\nEach SpaceX Starship launch from South Texas creates a stunning spectacle, previewing maneuvers that could one day be used to carry humans to Mars.\n\nBut the most powerful rocket ever built also unleashes an earsplitting sonic boom when its Super Heavy rocket booster returns for a landing.\n\nNow, with more launches on the horizon, new research suggests the noise could spell trouble, including environmental risks and potential hearing damage.\n\nMeanwhile, a massive fragment of a space object crashed to Earth in a remote village of Kenya.\n\nThe space debris is just one of several pieces that have plummeted back to the planet. However, experts are more worried about the growing number of objects circling our world.\n\nDefying gravity\n\nA visualization depicts the accidental February 2009 collision of the defunct Kosmos 2251 and active Iridium 33 communication satellites that created thousands of pieces of debris. ESA\n\nTens of thousands of identifiable pieces of space junk orbit Earth, along with potentially millions more that can\u2019t be seen or tracked. These stray objects pose a risk to astronauts, satellites, and other space-based technologies that we rely on for internet and other services.\n\n\u201cThe number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,\u201d said Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cSo we are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading.\u201d\n\nThe scenario, in which space debris collides and creates more debris, is called Kessler Syndrome. Eventually, the proliferation could make Earth\u2019s orbit too clogged for satellites to orbit \u2014 or for space missions to launch.\n\nWhile we may not be in dire straits yet, space traffic needs to be addressed sooner rather than later, experts say.\n\nOcean secrets\n\nScientists studying comb jellies, one of the oldest animals on Earth, discovered that individuals have the ability to fuse their bodies, as well as the nervous and digestive systems, to become one organism.\n\nInjured comb jellies could fuse and move as a unit, the biologists found.\n\nTime-lapse imaging of the fusion process showed just how quickly the jellies were able to synchronize their muscle movements and effectively become one.\n\nThis pairing, resulting in a single animal with multiple sensory organs, may be a survival mechanism, the researchers believe.\n\nForce of nature\n\nSimushir Island in the northwest Pacific was the source of a previously unidentified 1831 eruption. Oleg Dirksen\n\nResearchers have finally pinpointed the location of a \u201cmystery volcano\u201d that erupted so violently it cooled Earth\u2019s climate in 1831.\n\nThe eruption, the most powerful of the 19th century, lofted so much sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that the annual average temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere dropped by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nAn in-depth study of ice cores taken from Greenland enabled researchers to look back across time and isolate volcanic glass shards deposited nearly 200 years ago.\n\nAnalyzing and mapping the likely trajectory of the particles helped scientists zero in on the Zavaritskii volcano on the remote and uninhabited Simushir Island, part of the Kuril Islands archipelago disputed by Russia and Japan.\n\nConsequences\n\nA devastating heat wave caused the worst single-species mortality event documented in modern history, and the birds affected by the disaster aren\u2019t bouncing back, according to a recent study.\n\nThe marine heat wave, known as \u201cthe Blob,\u201d stretched across the ocean from California to the Gulf of Alaska between 2014 and 2016. The spike in temperatures killed about 4 million common murres in Alaska, which represents half of the state\u2019s population of those seabirds. The birds play a critical role as predators in the marine food web.\n\n\u201cThere are about 8 million people in New York City, so it would be like losing half of the population \u2026 in a single winter,\u201d said Brie Drummond, a wildlife biologist at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nFantastic creatures\n\nResearchers discovered a pygmy pipehorse, subsequently named Cylix nkosi, in the subtropical waters off South Africa. Richard Smith/California Academy of Sciences\n\nA tiny seahorse relative, an adventurous moth and a vegetarian piranha named after a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d villain are just a few of the hundreds of previously unknown species announced by scientists in 2024.\n\nScientific divers had one chance to explore South African reefs, where they spotted a pygmy pipehorse. The golf tee-size species was found camouflaged near some sponges, expanding the creature\u2019s known range from the waters of New Zealand\u2019s North Island to the Indian Ocean.\n\nMeanwhile, a moth found its way into the boot of a photographer, who accidently transported the insect from South America to her home in Wales. Her daughter, ecologist Daisy Cadet, spied the unusual moth as it fluttered around the house and reached out to London\u2019s Natural History Museum.\n\nTake note\n\nCatch up on what you might have missed:\n\n\u2014 Mark your calendars!

            "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel\u2019s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIf 2024 was the year travelers were spared the introduction of bureaucracy for visa-free travel to Europe, 2025 is the year reality kicks in.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s ETIAS visa waiver, much delayed, is currently on track to roll out in 2025.\n\nBefore that, the UK will introduce its ETA system on January 8.\n\nETA, which stands for Electronic Travel Authorisation, is a new digital registration scheme for travelers who don\u2019t need a visa to enter the UK.\n\nWhile before they could hop on a plane and present themselves at passport control on landing, now, travelers will need to get pre-travel authorization to fly to the UK.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the new rules.\n\nWho needs an ETA?\n\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t need a visa to travel to the UK will soon need an ETA \u2014 an \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d which pre-clears you for entry to the country before travel. This is the UK equivalent of the United States\u2019 ESTA \u2014 a mandatory, paid-for authorization to travel, with security clearance done in advance.\n\nThe scheme debuted to Gulf Cooperation Council nationals in 2024, and the next stage is to roll it out to other non-European travelers \u2014 including the six million travelers from the US, Canada and Australia who enter the UK each year. The full list of 48 states requiring the ETA is here.\n\nTravelers from these countries will need an ETA to enter the UK from January 8. The only exception is EU citizens, who will need an ETA to enter the UK from April 2, 2025.\n\nCitizens of these countries who are already resident in the UK do not need an ETA.\n\nThe scheme is for \u201cshort\u201d visits to the UK of less than six months for tourism and business. There are a few other categories of ETA, including for short-term study and permitted paid engagements. These are listed on the UK government website.\n\nIs it a visa?\n\nAlthough some people are referring to it as a visa, it\u2019s actually a visa waiver. Travelers whose citizenship means they need a visa to enter the UK will still need to apply for a visa. (They won\u2019t, however, need to get the ETA on top of that.)\n\nCountries work on reciprocity when it comes to immigration. When the United States introduced its ESTA visa waiver in 2009, it was inevitable that countries now subject to it would introduce their own similar schemes.\n\nHow do I get one?\n\nThe cost is a non-refundable \u00a310 (just under $12.50), and you can apply through the official app listed on the UK government website, or directly online.\n\nThe apps \u2014 for iPhone and Android \u2014 boast of being quicker, with 10-minute processing times. Be sure to apply through official channels, rather than through third-party websites, which may charge extra fees, and are less likely to handle your data securely.\n\nYou will need to upload a photo of your passport, scan and photograph yourself as you apply, upload the photo, and answer various questions about your plans. Applying online takes around 20 minutes and you must complete the process in one go \u2014 there is no chance to save as you go.\n\nA decision will normally be given within three days, though the government warns it could take longer. You are allowed to travel to the UK while waiting for your decision, if you need to visit urgently; however you must have made the application before you travel.\n\nNote that having an ETA doesn\u2019t guarantee entry to the UK. You must still go through passport control and Border Force officials still have the final say over whether you can enter the country.\n\nHow long will it be valid?\n\nValidity lasts for two years and multiple entries \u2014 so you can visit as often as you please. However, note that it will be digitally linked to your passport \u2014 so if you get a new passport during those two years, it will no longer be valid and you must apply for a new one.\n\nEven passengers transiting through the UK at the likes of Heathrow Airport will need an ETA. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nCan families get a joint ETA?\n\nEveryone entering the UK needs their own ETA, including children and even babies. But you can apply on somebody else\u2019s behalf.\n\nDoes this mean I can stay as long as I like?\n\nThe ETA is only intended for short stays of up to six months.\n\nI\u2019m just transiting through the UK. Do I still need the ETA?\n\nEveryone entering UK soil, even for a quick onward connection, must have an ETA. (This is the same for any travelers transiting through the US, who need an ESTA.) You will not be allowed through passport control to the transit area without one.\n\nDoes this cover me to enter Europe, too?\n\nTo enter Europe, you\u2019ll need an ETIAS \u2014 the EU travel waiver, which has been much delayed but is currently slated to start some time in 2025. Stay tuned for details as the countdown approaches.",

            "title": "From heart attacks to dealing with death: The life of a cruise ship doctor",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAh, life on the open waves: a place to relax, get away from it all and watch the world go by \u2014 literally.\n\nMillions of travelers love cruises precisely because of their blend of remoteness and comfort. But what is a much-needed break from the real world when you\u2019re feeling well can be trickier if you fall ill or have an accident onboard.\n\nBreak your leg hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital or have a heart attack, and you might not be so pleased to be offshore.\n\nOf course, every cruise ship has a medical center \u2014 but how big is it \u2014 and what do they do in there? Are the doctors general practitioners or is it more like the ER? And if worst comes to worse \u2014 what happens if a passenger dies onboard?\n\nDr. Aleksandar Durovic, who\u2019s spent the past 20 years as a medic on cruise ships, says that a doctor\u2019s life on the high seas is very different from one on terra firma.\n\n\u201cWatching \u2018The Love Boat,\u2019 you think it\u2019s just going around having dinner and drinks with guests, but it\u2019s really not like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a job full of stress and responsibility. The medical side can be very demanding. Most of what we do on big cruise ships is emergency services, like in an ER, but we are also general practitioners for crew, and take care of chronic medical needs.\u201d\n\nAmy White, director of medical operations for Vikand, which provides medical services for over 150 ships on 33 cruise lines, says that staff are cherry picked to have a background in emergency medicine of at least three years. \u201cThe reason is you can have any and all types of medical emergencies [onboard], she says. \u201cYou need highly trained staff to do that. Lots of vessels have one doctor, so you\u2019re it, there\u2019s no backup other than us [shoreside]. So you need to be able to work alone.\u201d\n\nThe other thing you\u2019ll be tested on before boarding is your bedside manner, says White. \u201cOn ships you have to have hospitality \u2014 guests are always right,\u201d she says.\n\nNurse Amy White has spent a decade in the cruise industry, including onboard Royal Caribbean and Viking ships. Amy White\n\nDurovic spent 13 years working in his native Montenegro before moving onto cruise ships. He spent two years with MSC, and 17 with Carnival. Right now he\u2019s taken a job unlike any other in the industry: he is the sole doctor onboard Villa Vie Odyssey, the ship that is making its way around the world on a three-year voyage.\n\nWhite, meanwhile, started as a nurse working in emergency departments in her native South Africa, and was lured into cruise ships by two co-workers \u201cwho\u2019d been on ships and talked about it all the time.\u201d In 2012, she joined Royal Caribbean as a nurse, then moved to Viking where worked up to the role of fleet nurse, before joining Vikand as medical operations manager.\n\nWhether a cruise is for three years or three days, the setup is usually the same, using guidelines laid out by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP).\n\nCruise lines that are members of CLIA, the Cruise Lines International Association, must have at least one onboard medical professional available 24/7, as well as two medical rooms, one of which must be for intensive care treatment. They must also have onboard equipment for monitoring vital signs.\n\nMany large cruise ships have at least one other doctor, as well as a small team of nurses, though this is down to company policy rather than legal requirements. White compares it to a \u201csmall community urgent care or emergency department \u2014 we have a treatment area, one or two ICUs with a ventilator, cardiac monitoring capabilities and a defibrillator.\u201d\n\nFrom 2026, ultrasound capabilities will also be mandatory on CLIA members\u2019 vessels.\n\nLarge cruise ships also have a morgue onboard for when the worst happens.\n\nThe onboard team is backed up by shoreside staff, including doctors with extensive emergency medicine experience. \u201cThe big companies \u2014 Carnival, Royal Caribbean, MSC \u2014 have a medical department in the office giving you full support,\u201d says Durovic. Smaller cruise companies, such as Villa Vie, work with external providers to get the same service. Vikand is one of these companies, providing medical services for over 150 ships on 33 cruise lines, including the staff onboard, and an on-the-ground team to help with logistics.\n\nThen there\u2019s the ship\u2019s captain, who is ultimately responsible for all the souls onboard. They get involved with logistics if a patient needs to be offloaded, or in the case of a death onboard.\n\nBut otherwise, the medical team is all at sea \u2014 alone.\n\n\u2018Similar to any ER\u2019\n\nAleksandar Durovic is the doctor onboard Villa Vie Odyssey, the ship on a three-year global cruise. Courtesy Aleksander Durovic\n\nFor Durovic, working on a cruise ship is a great combination of adrenaline-fueled emergency medicine and general practice, where doctors can build a relationship with their patients. While most interaction with passengers will be of an emergency nature, when it comes to dealing with the crew, onboard doctors become general practitioners, helping them with chronic conditions, building a relationship and even overseeing their mental health. That\u2019s also the case on Villa Vie, where some passengers plan to remain as long as they are physically able to.\n\nThe vast majority of cases cruise doctors see, however, are emergencies.\n\n\u201cRespiratory problems are the main thing, but anything can arise,\u201d says Durovic. \u201cHeart attacks, heart failure, cardiac arrest. Strokes, injuries, fractured bones, spine injuries and head injuries. It\u2019s similar to any ER around the world, and some ships can be very busy.\u201d\n\nHe says that on large ships, doctors tend to deal with around one death per cruise, while White reckons it\u2019s at least one per quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty common \u2014 more common on lines with more elderly passengers,\u201d she says.\n\nWhite says that while emergency medicine on dry land tends to involve a lot of accidents, on a ship the caseload is different. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily trauma \u2014 we saw a lot of chronic heart disease patients in acute cardiac failure,\u201d she says, remembering how she had to put patients on ventilators in her on-ship days.\n\nThe other thing they see a lot of is stomach flu and respiratory diseases \u2014 not a big deal on land, but crucial to contain onboard. \u201cYou come into the ER with diarrhea, we get you on a drip and send you home. On a ship you get isolated for 48 hours. Those kind of things they don\u2019t teach in nursing school,\u201d says White.\n\nFor Durovic, his early experiences with MSC Cruises, when it was still a young company with a handful of ships, taught him how resourceful ship doctors can be.\n\n\u201cI saw the scale of medicine that you can do on the ship, with support from the land,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have CT scans, you\u2019re in the middle of the ocean and need to stabilize the patient long enough to reach the next port, or transfer to a helicopter to a facility on land.\u201d\n\nSo what happens if you have an accident or feel ill onboard \u2014 and are your chances of recovery as good as they would be on land?\n\nWhat actually happens below decks?\n\nShip medical centers \u2014 like this, on Holland America Line's MS Ryndam \u2014 are small but surprisingly capable. Keith Larby/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nFirstly, here\u2019s hoping you bought travel insurance \u2014 because cruise ship medical care is expensive. Be sure when buying your policy that it includes cruise cover, which usually costs a little extra, and to detail all the countries you\u2019ll be calling at as port stops.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of falling ill while on a cruise is low, but when you travel \u2014 by air and land as well \u2014 there\u2019s always the chance that it could happen,\u201d says Adam Coulter, executive editor at Cruise Critic, who has only had to use a medical facility onboard once \u2014 for sunburn for a family member.\n\nWhatever the time of day or night, you can call for assistance \u2014 ships are mandated by law to have at least one member of the medical team on duty 24/7. If you\u2019re able to, you\u2019ll make your way to the medical center, usually on a lower deck. If you\u2019re unable to move, staff (usually the nurses, says White) can come and see you in your cabin, and can help transfer you downstairs \u2014 certain members of the housekeeping team on every ship are also trained to be emergency transporters and CPR responders, taking clients on backboards or stretchers downstairs.\n\nYou might see the doctor immediately \u2014 or the nurse might book you in, sometimes running blood tests so they can have the results ready by the time the doctor gets involved.\n\nYes, blood tests. Although ship medical centers might be small, they can run a barrage of tests, from bloods to X-rays, and can carry out small surgeries, put casts on broken bones, insert catheters, and even intubate and put patients on ventilators. They can reinflate collapsed lungs and stabilize heart attacks. They can even do blood transfusions, appealing over the loudspeakers for volunteer donors amongst the other passengers. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed what kind of things we can do,\u201d says Durovic.\n\nSurgery is not possible, however. Patients requiring that will need to be offloaded from the ship to an onshore medical facility.\n\nAnd even for relatively straightforward surgery, the logistics can be trying. For a burst appendix, for example, doctors can give you antibiotics, and stabilize you with pain medication, then evacuate you to the nearest onshore medical center for a CT scan and surgery.\n\nBut getting patients onshore takes planning. The onshore medical teams help, says Durovic. \u201cThey work with you on the best route, they coordinate with the navigational team to see where the ship can be diverted, and the weather conditions \u2014 a helicopter can\u2019t fly if there\u2019s dust or if it\u2019s too windy.\u201d\n\nThe captain has the last word on logistics, liaising with the nearest coastguard. If the ship is at sea, depending on the situation (both of the patient and the ship), it might make a diversion to offload the patient by pilot boat or helicopter, if time is of the essence. This is where travel insurance becomes crucial \u2013 because the patient will be sent the bill.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain how many people who need a helivac don\u2019t have medical insurance,\u201d says White. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that you do \u2014 it depends where you are, but the cost can be up to $50,000.\u201d And while passengers are able to decline, she says, \u201cThey need to understand what the risks are if we don\u2019t get you off the vessel.\u201d\n\nHeart attacks at sea\n\nCardiac arrest is one of the most common incidents medical teams deal with onboard, but while having heart failure at sea sounds like a recipe for disaster, they can often save patients\u2019 lives. Teams can\u2019t do an angiogram onboard \u2014 but not all hospitals can either, says White. What they can do is administer thrombolytics \u2014 medicines that break up a clot in the event of a stroke or heart attack. \u201cWe can mitigate any further damage\u201d before getting patients to onshore care if they need, she says. The same goes for a stroke or a bleed.\n\nEven straightforward accidents and injuries can be repaired onboard \u2014 teams can X-ray then splint, stabilize fractures and even do full casts. \u201cIf it\u2019s a femur fracture we have a traction splint \u2014 we can position you properly and get you off in the next available port. It\u2019s the same with a hip fracture,\u201d says White.\n\nDeath onboard\n\nShip medical teams work with the captain and local coastguard and health authorities to offload sick passengers, as happened with the Diamond Princess moored in Yokohama, Japan, in February 2020. Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf course, sometimes the unthinkable happens and a passenger dies. Urban myths abound \u2014 supposedly, a sudden influx of ice cream on the menu means that someone has died and their body has been stored in the freezer.\n\nShockingly, that was indeed the case until about 40 years ago, says White. \u201cBefore they had morgues, they put them in the ice-cream fridge.\u201d\n\nNow, though, most vessels have a morgue, with the exception of expedition ships, which rarely have room. \u201cSometimes the body is put outside, when you don\u2019t have any land for three days, or [the possibility of] a helicopter,\u201d she says.\n\nToday, says Durovic, there are tight procedures around passenger deaths.\n\nThe medical team must immediately inform the captain, as well as the medical team offshore. They must bathe the body, and notify the authorities on dry land. In the US, that means the coastguard and the Centers for Disease Control, says Durovic.\n\n\u201cThe decide what to do. Sometimes medical examiners will come onboard, and take the body for an autopsy. It depends case by case.\u201d Security is stepped up around the body while it rests in the onboard morgue. White adds that usually police will board the vessel at the next port, to take notes and sometimes interview the doctor. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been on a vessel where there\u2019s suspicion,\u201d she says. Local funeral directors usually offload the body in port, since most authorities don\u2019t allow ships to set sail with a body onboard. The only exception, she says, if it\u2019s a US-Mexico return cruise, where they might be allowed to depart Mexico to bring the body of an American citizen back to the States.\n\nBut before all that, says White, there is a moment of silence. \u201cObviously the doctor pronounces the death, but for most medical teams, the person is given some respect. There\u2019s a moment of silence before the body is prepared.\u201d\n\nIf the person has been in an accident, they must keep all the medical devices used on the patient as testament to their recovery efforts. If, as usually happens, it was a natural death, they are taken to the morgue.\n\nPassengers injuring themselves on ships are relatively rare \u2014 the teams tend to treat incidents like heart attacks or strokes more commonly. Planet One Images/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of administration, and we also speak to the family if they\u2019re not there [onboard],\u201d says White. \u201cGuest relations take good care of the family arranging flights or trauma counseling if they want to stay onboard. And if any crew need mental health support \u2014 because sometimes it\u2019s crew who passes \u2014 we provide mental health support to crew, too.\u201d\n\nAnd although your mind might go straight to a Hollywood-style scenario of a passenger dying of a communicable disease, Durovic says that in his 20 years in the industry, it has never happened (although he\u2019s had several patients in a critical condition with Covid since the start of the pandemic). All the deaths he has handled have been from natural causes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling for the whole ship,\u201d he says, of a death onboard. \u201cShips are supposed to be fun places, for people to enjoy their vacation. Any event like that is really stressful for everyone \u2014 but at least we [medics] have training.\u201d Dealing with a cardiac arrest, he says, is the most stressful event for him and his team. \u201cSometimes you manage it, sometimes not,\u201d he says about CPR.\n\nWhite has never forgotten one of her onboard losses. Once, she had to deal with a man who was on his 40th wedding anniversary cruise when he went into cardiac arrest. \u201cAll he\u2019d wanted to do was see the Panama Canal and we had just left it the day before,\u201d she says, the emotion still in her voice. \u201cIt was just a few minutes before New Year\u2019s Eve. We resuscitated him but we didn\u2019t get him back.\u201d\n\nCrew cleaning rashes and diabetes\n\nShip doctors act as general practitioners for the onboard crew, who often have chronic conditions linked to their work. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile passenger incidents can be the most dramatic duties for a cruise doctor, what\u2019s equally important is general practice for the crew, from long-term support for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, to acute problems \u2014 \u201cWe get lots of galley teams who have rashes from the chemicals they use to clean, and they\u2019re cleaning all the time,\u201d says White.\n\nDurovic says crew can have online psychological help online as well as an evaluation in ports of call.\n\n\u201cBeing at sea is very lonely \u2013 you miss out on a lot of things,\u201d says White. \u201cMy mom became very ill and it took me three days to get home. You\u2019re at sea, there\u2019s nothing you can do. I got to her \u2014 but many don\u2019t.\u201d She says that getting a good team together is crucial: \u201cOn ships you have to learn a lot more than just medicine.\u201d And the teams tend to endear themselves to the rest of the crew. \u201cThe medical crew parties are the best,\u201d she says. \u201cYou put stuff in syringes and dress up as nurses.\u201d\n\nThe fast pace, distance from friends and family isn\u2019t for everyone, but Durovic is in no hurry to give up.\n\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s time to come home, and I eventually will, but I learn a lot about what people are doing around the world,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something to take with you.\u201d\n\nHis patients on his current three-year cruise will be hoping he sees it through to the end of their own odyssey.",

Modern airplanes can whiz people from New York to Singapore or from London to Cape Town, journeys that would have taken weeks or months in previous generations.\n\nBut sometimes too much choice can be paralyzing. We\u2019re in the era of FOMO \u2014 fear of missing out. Social media makes it seem like every person you\u2019ve ever met is on an exotic vacation at any given time, so how do we choose which places to visit?\n\nCNN Travel\u2019s belief is that every place has reasons that make it worth visiting. However, our staff has curated this list of 25 destinations we think are particularly worth visiting in 2025.\n\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan Visit Almaty\n\nAlmaty, Kazakhstan\n\nCentral Asia\u2019s dramatic landscapes and unique urban centers are proving to be particularly alluring. Leading the way is Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Almaty, which as we recently reported has become the region\u2019s new \u201cCapital of Cool.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of those rare cities that truly has it all \u2014 great food, thriving nightlife, a fast-growing arts and culture scene and easy access to some of the world\u2019s most stunning, untouched landscapes, thanks to its position at the base of the Tian Shan mountains.\n\nAlmaty\u2019s metro stations are literally works of art, the perfect complement to its world-class museums including the Abilkhan Kasteev State Art Museum, which is filled with more than 20,000 artworks and the Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture, which moves to new premises in 2025.\n\nWhat to eat? Almaty is considered the birthplace of \u201cNeo Nomad cuisine,\u201d a blend of modern cooking techniques and traditional ingredients used by the nomadic people who reside in the country\u2019s grasslands. Start your culinary journey at the stunning Auyl restaurant in the Medeu Valley south of the city,\n\nGetting to Almaty is surprisingly easy, too.

That may begin to change as the archipelago\u2019s first scheduled international passenger flight \u2014 from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the islands\u2019 capital of Port Blair \u2014 launched in late 2024.\n\nSome who have heard of this area likely unfairly associate it with John Allen Chau, the erstwhile American missionary who attempted to evangelize to an uncontacted tribe in the North Sentinel Islands and was killed. But it\u2019s incredibly difficult \u2014 not to mention illegal \u2014 to access North Sentinel from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and it would be a shame to write off these beautiful, friendly locals and the hospitality they offer.\n\nThe lucky people who have been often compare this string of islands to the Maldives \u2014 but before the big international brands showed up. Expect fresh juices, chai and breakfast parathas at locally owned cafes, barefoot beaches as far as the eye can see and an embarrassment of riches when it comes to water activities such as snorkeling and kayaking.\n\nBarren Island, home to India\u2019s only live volcano, is accessible via private boat, and Swaraj Dweep, just a ferry ride off of Port Blair, is a scuba diver\u2019s dream.\n\nInternet connectivity is also spotty at best in the archipelago, so take an opportunity to truly unplug \u2014 perhaps the biggest luxury of all. \u2014 Lilit Marcus\n\nBequia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nThe sun turns everything golden at Bequia Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean.

Situated half an hour by air from the Caribbean island of Barbados, Bequia is one of the 32 islands that make up St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its neighbor Mustique is undoubtedly more famous, but Bequia\u2019s allure is undeniable.\n\nIn 2024, the island was hit by category 4 Hurricane Beryl, but Bequia has bounced back stronger than ever, with a surge in arrivals reported in September.\n\nWith miles of white sand, Princess Margaret Beach, named after the younger sister of England\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, is its most famous. It\u2019s arguably its most beautiful beach, too, and definitely worth a visit. Over in nearby Friendship Bay, the Bequia Heritage Museum offers a complete look at the island\u2019s history, including its long-standing whaling tradition.\n\nMeanwhile, Bequia\u2019s annual TradeWinds yacht event, which celebrates the culture and marine heritage of the Grenadines, draws in visitors from across the world each year. \u2014 Tamara Hardingham-Gill\n\nBolivia\n\nHip Airstream trailers provide a way to stay overnight at Salar de Uyuni, the world's biggest salt plain.

While most visitors tend to tack a stay in Bolivia on to a longer trip to Peru, \u201cthe country is a destination in its own right,\u201d says Journey Latin America\u2019s Laura Rendell-Dunn. \u201cYou can easily spend two weeks or more exploring its many highlights.\u201d\n\nCapital La Paz\u2019s restaurant scene is nipping at Lima\u2019s heels with places such as Gustu, opened by Noma co-founder Claus Meyer and now run by Bolivian chef Marsia Taha. It\u2019s winning plaudits around the world for its redefined traditional Bolivian food, including alligator with copoazu (a sweet Amazonian fruit) and llama with llullucha (an Andean algae staple).\n\nTop-notch hotels such as Atix provide cushy digs in the 11,975 feet (3,650 meters) altitude of La Paz. In more rural areas, you\u2019ll find barefoot luxury such as Airstream campers on the Salar de Uyuni salt flats.\n\nWherever you travel in Bolivia \u2014 to Lake Titicaca (bordering Peru in the Andes, it\u2019s the world\u2019s highest navigable lake), Tiwanaku (a nearby pre-Inca settlement) or UNESCO-protected Sucre with its Spanish colonial architecture \u2014 you\u2019ll find luxury digs and, usually, fewer tourists than across the border in Peru. \u2014 Julia Buckley\n\nChemnitz, Germany\n\nA giant bronze bust of Karl Marx looks over cultural events in the heart of Chemnitz in eastern Germany. Peter Rossner/Chemnitz 2025\n\nOnce renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt, this east German city\u2019s most famous landmark is a gigantic bronze head, the \u201csecond-largest bust in the world,\u201d of the 19th-century philosopher. Erected in 1971, the imposing sculpture, a reminder of Chemnitz\u2019s complicated past, has long been a top attraction for visitors. Yet Marx never actually visited the destination in his lifetime.\n\nThis year, the spotlight is shifting to its many other notable characteristics. Chemnitz shines as one of the 2025 European Capitals of Culture, along with Slovenia\u2019s Nova Gorica. Once one of Germany\u2019s richest cities, Chemnitz\u2019s rich diversity is being celebrated in the form of jazz, indie and dance festivals, street art, vintage car rallies and exhibitions.\n\nVisitors will also be able to take in Chemnitz\u2019s eclectic architectural styles. The two-part town hall \u2014 made up of the Old Town Hall, or Altes Rathaus, built in the 15th century, and the Art Nouveau style New Town Hall, Neues Rathaus, erected in the early 20th century \u2014 is one of the finest examples.\n\nUsing the motto \u201cC the Unseen,\u201d officials are championing cultural projects such as the Purple Path, an art and sculpture trail that connects Chemnitz with 38 municipalities and communities, as well as highlighting the city\u2019s commitment to transforming small public spaces into community hubs.\n\n\u201cThe cultural program shows in an impressive way where the cultural heart of Europe will beat in 2025: in Chemnitz!\u201d says the program\u2019s managing director Stefan Schmidtke. \u2014 THG\n\nEngland's footpaths CNN\n\nAll manner of footpaths, bridleways and byways crisscross the English countryside, many of which have been trodden by humans since ancient times. Access to them is enshrined in law passed just over 75 years ago. That means no matter who owns the land, there\u2019s usually a signposted trail, and some of the most idyllic scenery in the world remains open to all.\n\nEngland might not have the epic mountain trails found in some parts of the world, but just yards from almost every doorstep in the land, there\u2019s a hedgerow path wending off into a green tunnel of overhanging trees or onto a romantically wuthering moorland.\n\nPopular long-distance routes such as the Pennine Way (60 years old in 2025), Coast-to-Coast or South Downs Way get attention, but quieter corners of the country have their own waymarked trails. Indeed, anyone armed with an Ordnance Survey map can create their own.\n\nOnly visiting London? Check out the Capital Ring Walk \u2014 a sectioned trail that loops around the city\u2019s suburbs and hidden wildernesses. Or head up the London Underground\u2019s Metropolitan Line and sample the Chess Valley Walk from Chesham to Rickmansworth: 10 miles (16 kilometers) of mostly rural bliss with a Tube station at either end. \u2014 Barry Neild\n\nEswatani and Mpumalanga province, South Africa\n\nEswatini's Sibebe Rock is the largest exposed granite pluton in the world.

What sets Blyde River apart, though, is that it\u2019s richly blanketed in green subtropical vegetation. God\u2019s Window is one of the most spectacular viewpoints on what\u2019s known as the Panorama Route. Visitors often combine it with a trip to Kruger National Park, just over an hour\u2019s drive away.\n\nIn Eswatini, Sibebe Rock is Africa\u2019s answer to Australia\u2019s Uluru, but without the crowds. Just 10 kilometers north of the capital Mbabane, it\u2019s the largest exposed granite pluton in the world. It\u2019s a challenging but rewarding hike, best done with a guide, following marked trails, and during the dry season (April to September). \u2014 Maureen O\u2019Hare\n\nGda\u0144sk, Poland\n\nKayakers glide past the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, Poland. Patryk_Kosmider/iStock Editorial/Getty Images\n\nGda\u0144sk is perhaps most famous for being the location where World War II officially began, as well as the birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which played an important role in the collapse of communism in Poland. But there\u2019s far more to this port city, located on the Baltic coast of the country, than its connection to defining moments in history.\n\nFormerly known as Danzig, Gda\u0144sk was almost completely rebuilt after the aforementioned war, emerging as one of Poland\u2019s most beautiful and colorful cities. Perhaps fittingly, the Museum of the Second World War, a towering prism situated along the city\u2019s waterfront, stands out as one of the most notable examples of its most stunning architecture. There\u2019s also the 14th-century Artus Court and the Old Town\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s Church, thought to be one of the largest brick churches in the world standing at 78 meters (256 feet) high.\n\nIn 2023, the European Commission\u2019s Report on the Quality of Life in European Cities ranked Gda\u0144sk as one of the best cities in which to live, with the majority of its residents being satisfied with their living conditions.\n\nThis year marks a turning point for the city, with the completion of its \u201cgame-changing\u201d port terminal, moving Gda\u0144sk one step closer to its goal of becoming the main gateway to Central and Eastern Europe. \u2014 THG\n\nGilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan\n\nGilgit-Baltistan is a challenging but sublime region of northern Pakistan. Tjetjep Rustandi/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBack in the 1970s, Pakistan was an adventure travel hot spot, its sublime mountain scenery a key stop on the \u201cHippie Trail\u201d overland route from Europe to South Asia. Decades of political instability put an end to that, but those epic peaks haven\u2019t gone anywhere.\n\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan region in the Karokoram Mountains isn\u2019t the easiest place to get to \u2014 flight schedules can be unreliable, roads can be blocked off seasonally \u2014 but it has more tantalizing peaks than a lemon meringue pie.\n\nIt\u2019s home to five of the 14 \u201ceight-thousander\u201d peaks recognized as the world\u2019s highest. That includes K2, the world\u2019s second-tallest mountain but No. 1 in terms of difficulty and danger.\n\nIn terms of tourism and infrastructure, hiking in this region makes the Himalayas look like a traipse in Central Park.\n\nLast year, Nepal banned solo hiking throughout that country, and this, too, is a place where going alone is not an option. It is, however, now accessible through trips organized by reputable global tour operators, including G Adventures and Wild Frontiers. Intrepid offers a 10-day, fully supported hike through the region known as \u201cLittle Tibet\u201d starting at around $3,000. \u2014 MOH\n\nItalian trains\n\nLa Dolce Vita Orient Express promises fine dining and the romance of the rails. Courtesy Orient Express Italy\n\nLuxury lovers are holding their breath for the launch of La Dolce Vita Orient Express, a super-luxurious train that\u2019ll rattle around Italy from April, with eight itineraries. They\u2019ll include the well-traveled paths of Venice and Tuscany to lesser-known parts of southern Italy, including Abruzzo and Basilicata (the Eternal Stones of Matera itinerary), as well as Sicily to Rome and back.\n\nThose of us with shallower pockets will be relieved to know that we don\u2019t have to spend five figures to ride the rails in style in Italy.\n\nIn December, state operator Trenitalia was ranked the best in Europe, scoring especially highly for its \u201ctravel experience.\u201d Its high-speed Frecce trains connect major cities on a T-shape down the peninsula, often faster than flying. For a touch of dolce vita luxury, book the Executive class, a carriage with huge recliner chairs and butler service.\n\nThere are also the Treni Turistici Italiani (TTI) trains \u2014 often vintage \u2014 that have been reupholstered and redesigned to cater for a luxurious visitor experience. New routes for 2025 include a cross-border summer service from Milan to Saint-Rapha\u00ebl on France\u2019s C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, and a seasonal night train from Rome to Lecce in the sizzling southern Puglia region. \u2014 JB\n\nKa\u00e7kar Mountains, Turkey\n\nChoose a rustic-chic cabin for the best views of the Ka\u00e7kar Mountains.

The Ka\u00e7kar Mountains\u2019 mild, humid climate means this is an alpine idyll brimming with biodiversity.\n\nIn summer, the slopes are carpeted with wildflowers, making the area popular with hikers, while hazelnut fields and tea plantations hint at the region\u2019s excellent produce.\n\nThis is also the home of the prized Caucasian honey bee, and hives are a common sight in this quiet and rural region, which has been a national park since 1994.\n\nIn October, visitors come to admire the spectacular russets and yellows of the fall foliage. The mountains\u2019 craggy peaks rise to almost 4,000 meters (13,120 feet), and there are glaciers and glacier lakes in their upper reaches. There are also plenty of waterfalls and streams, with the 63-meter (207-foot) Maral Waterfall, one of the tallest in the country.\n\nSkiing and heli-skiing are increasingly popular winter activities, although the tourism industry here is still in its infancy.\n\nThat\u2019s set to change, though, as the opening of Rize-Artvin Airport on the Black Sea coast in 2022 has made the region much more accessible for international visitors. A flight from Istanbul takes just over two hours. \u2014 MOH\n\nOsaka, Japan Kansai Tourism Board\n\nKansai, Japan\n\nOsaka is playing host to Expo 2025 from April to October.

About 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the famous capital city, Mendoza glories in its own deserved reputation as a para\u00edso del vino.\n\nIn all, the area is home to about 1,200 wineries, and Malbec is prized here. This cosmopolitan city is also known for its world-class restaurants and spas, tree-lined streets and sunny skies. The visuals here are stunning, with the towering Andes Mountains forming the backdrop to the city. If wine\u2019s not your jam, you\u2019ll have other ways to relax.\n\nIf you\u2019re OK with crowds, consider visiting during the annual Fiesta de la Vendimia. Events throughout Mendoza province start in January and February and climax in March, when some 40,000 visitors come to sample local wine varieties. If you go then, you\u2019ll be arriving in the Argentinian summer.\n\nVisit the lovely General San Mart\u00edn Historical Park, known for its 500 species of roses and Natural Science Museum.

Now the longest-running radio program in history, the Opry has featured performers such as Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton as well as today\u2019s rising stars.\n\nThe Ryman Auditorium, the \u201cMother Church of Country Music,\u201d hosted the Opry for many years before the show moved to the current Opry House in 1974. Visitors can tour both venues. And there will be more shows on the Opry calendar than ever in 2025, including special birthday and anniversary events and select dates at the Ryman.\n\nThere\u2019s more going on in Music City. A new, mixed-use development, Nashville Yards, is expected to open in 2025, anchored by a 4,500-person capacity music venue, The Pinnacle.\n\nThere\u2019s also an effort under way to bring more Asian flavors to Nashville with its first Chinatown.

But when it comes to less-trodden islands in this unparalleled part of the planet, it\u2019s hard to compare any place with Niue.\n\nThe tiny self-governing Polynesian island in free association with New Zealand (residents have New Zealand passports) lies roughly between Fiji and the Cook Islands. Since 2022, 100% of Niue\u2019s territorial waters have been designated a multi-use marine park, including a vast no-take zone that\u2019s an important habitat for grey reef sharks and the endemic katuali sea snake.\n\nHumpback whales migrate, give birth and frolic with their calves just offshore from the 100-square-mile island from late June to October, when visitors have the opportunity to snorkel and sometimes scuba dive with them in waters that regularly push 160 feet of visibility (since Niue has no surface water flowing off it, the surrounding ocean is exceptionally clear).\n\nEven visitors who stay on dry land at spots like Scenic Matavai Resort regularly see humpbacks passing offshore during the season (the hotel\u2019s \u201cwhale bell\u201d rings to announce their presence).\n\nMagic abounds above the water\u2019s surface, too. \u201cSea tracks\u201d called Hala Tahi lead from the island\u2019s villages to the cliff\u2019s edge and down to the reefs below, where fascinating limestone caves and chasms and pristine swimming and snorkeling spots said to have been a favorite with Niuean royalty await. Home to just 1,700 people (roughly 600 of whom live in the tiny capital, Alofi), Niue is also a stargazing paradise as the world\u2019s first country to receive Dark Sky designation.\n\nMost visitors arrive on Air New Zealand flights from Auckland (3.5 hours) that come and go several days a week, keeping visitor levels low. \u2014 Terry Ward\n\nNuuk, Greenland\n\nThe Icefjord Centre in Ilulissat offers insight into the culture of local Inuit people.

This revitalized aviation hub in Greenland\u2019s capital is home to a 2,200-meter (7,217-foot) runway, allowing larger aircraft to land in the Arctic-based Danish territory for the first time. This summer, United Airlines will operate the first direct flight from the US to Greenland, landing in Nuuk.\n\nThe city is a great jumping-off point for exploring the rest of Greenland via boat or plane \u2014 from absorbing the culture of the local Inuit people at the Icefjord Centre in Ilulissat, to marveling at icebergs and considering the impact of the climate crisis at Disko Bay. But Nuuk isn\u2019t only a gateway to Greenland. City highlights include the history-filled National Museum and Archives, and the striking Sedna sculpture on the shoreline, a tribute to the Inuit goddess of the sea.\n\nAs Greenland\u2019s visitor numbers grow, travelers can help embrace sustainable tourism practices by employing local guides \u2014 whether that\u2019s for a locally run walking tour of the city, or to visit neighboring Nuup Kangerlu, a vast fjord that offers humpback whale sightings amid gorgeous mountain surroundings. \u2014 Francesca Street\n\nThe Ozarks, USA\n\nReady for some Americana entertainment?

Those are great, for sure, but they\u2019re just the start.\n\nOne of the Ozarks\u2019 best-kept secrets is the Johnny Morris Conservation Foundation, a privately owned, paid-entry nature and history reserve. One of its highlight attractions is Dogwood Canyon Nature Park in Lampe, Missouri. It holds fishing holes, historic chapels and bridges, biking and hiking trails plus a tram tour to visit free-roaming herds of elk and bison.\n\nIn Arkansas, Eureka Springs is a funky getaway with fun restaurants and places to stay, and it\u2019s emerged as something of an oasis for the LGBTQ community.

That\u2019s a gift in these days of overtourism \u2014 for here\u2019s a country that has everything, from the beach resorts of the Black Sea to the drop-dead gorgeousness of the Carpathian Mountains, and is reputedly trying to grow visitor numbers sustainably.\n\nYes, there\u2019s the Dracula thing at Bran Castle, but for other gothic medieval treats in wider Transylvania and beyond, try Timi\u0219oara, Cluj Napoca, Sibiu, Brasov and Sebes. Capital Bucharest has a charming Old Town, now a bit overloaded with tourist bars and restaurants, but the city\u2019s recent history is still a major draw. The jaw-dropping excess of communist-era dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s luxurious former home and his vast Palace of the Parliament (the world\u2019s heaviest building) are worth exploring.\n\nThey contrast with the extreme hardships he forced on the country\u2019s people, charted in the diminutive but essential Museum of Communism. A more idyllic past can still be found in the Romanian countryside. There\u2019s probably no better way to explore this than the recently launched Via Transilvanica, an 870-mile (1,400-kilometer) hiking trail through rural landscapes and villages seemingly frozen in time. \u2014 BN\n\nSan Francisco de Campeche, Mexico\n\nIndependence Plaza in the Old Town of San Francisco de Campeche is a popular spot for visitors.

That\u2019s where San Francisco de Campeche comes in.\n\nThe capital of Campeche state, this harbor city of about 250,000 is located on the western side of the verdant Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Campeche is one of just two states in Mexico with the US State Department\u2019s top safety rating, and the city occupies that sweet spot of having some tourism infrastructure without being \u201cdiscovered\u201d yet.\n\nSeafood lovers should appreciate offerings such as pompano in tin foil, Pan de Caz\u00f3n (Dogfish Bread) and various shrimp dishes that have a Caribbean flair. Architecture and history enthusiasts will be enthused \u2014 the old walled Historic Fortified Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Bastions (fortifications) and colonial churches abound. In the outdoors, the beaches of nearby Sihoplaya and Seybaplaya and the cenotes (freshwater sinkholes) make for splashy fun. And don\u2019t miss the Mayan ruins and tropical forests at Calakmul.\n\nGetting around the city might be easier in 2025 if the light rail system goes into operation in April as planned. \u2014 FB\n\nSierra Leone CNN\n\nSierra Leone\n\nThis English-speaking West African country has plenty to offer those adventurous enough to make the trip, although getting there isn\u2019t easy. There are connections via Brussels and Casablanca, but new airline Air Sierra Leone has yet to deliver direct flights to London promised for late 2024.\n\nTourism is still in its early stages 20 years on from civil war and a decade after a major Ebola outbreak. That means a county unspoiled by excessive visitors and still rough around the edges. Beaches like those at the Turtle Islands, Bureh and River Number Two have crystal waters and white or golden sands. Capital Freetown has markets, museums and, in the ruins of Bunce Island, a poignant tribute to the victims of the slave trade who passed through. Inland rainforests offer hiking and chimpanzee encounters.\n\n\u201cSierra Leone is hands down one of the safest and friendliest countries in Africa,\u201d says travel blogger Helen Davies, AKA Helen in Wonderland, just back from leading a tour in the country. \u201cThe people here are just beautiful, with an energy that\u2019s warm, welcoming and absolutely infectious. The country is rugged, raw, and unapologetically real, and that\u2019s exactly what makes it the perfect place for an intrepid traveler.\u201d \u2014 BN\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nStockholm's red line subway is known for its beautiful station art. Victor G\u00e5rds\u00e4ter/Visit Stockholm\n\nWandering around the city of Stockholm, travelers will be struck by the fresh air, vast open skies and constant watery views \u2014 the Swedish capital is made up of 14 islands, connected via bridges and ferries.\n\nThis island-based city is also part of the wider Stockholm outer archipelago, comprising some 30,000 islands. Visitors staying in downtown Stockholm can easily hop on a short ferry to nearby islands like Fj\u00e4derholmarna, where beautifully preserved historic architecture and more watery views await.\n\nBut for those feeling adventurous, the city of Stockholm recently opened a new 270-kilometer hiking trail crisscrossing the Stockholm outer archipelago. An accompanying website helps travelers map out routes.\n\nBack in the city center, visitors can learn more about Sweden\u2019s maritime history at the Vasa museum, home to a preserved 17th-century wreck. Meanwhile, the outdoor Skansen museum offers insights into Sweden\u2019s architectural and cultural history, while the ABBA Museum is interactive, pop-based fun.\n\nAfter a day hiking or sightseeing, don\u2019t forget to embrace the Swedish tradition of fika (AKA taking a break to enjoy a hot drink and a pastry) and sample the cinnamon buns at bustling Caf\u00e9 Saturnus or award-winning Robin Delselius Bageri. \u2014 FS\n\nTaup\u014d, New Zealand\n\nAt Huka Falls, 250,000 liters of water flow over the falls every second.

But travelers heading to the North Island in search of cinematic landscapes need look no further than Taup\u014d.\n\nNot to be missed are the lake\u2019s Ng\u0101toroirangi Mine Bay M\u0101ori Rock Carvings, which include a 14-meter bas-relief created by famed artist Matahi Brightwell representing the face of his ancestor, Ngatoroirangi.\n\nJust a few kilometers from Taup\u014d is Huka Falls, said to generate enough power to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in just 11 seconds.\n\nIn terms of food, the town\u2019s culinary scene is gaining increased recognition \u2014 it recently wrapped up its inaugural Treats of Taup\u014d food festival. Which is why we almost feel guilty sharing this fun fact: Taup\u014d is home to what might just be the world\u2019s most unusual McDonald\u2019s, where visitors can chow down on their Big Macs while seated inside a decommissioned WWII-era Douglas DC-3 airplane.\n\nWhere to stay? Taup\u014d\u2019s historic Huka Lodge turned 100 in 2024 and has just been given a makeover. Set to reopen in March 2025, this luxury property that started out as a fishing camp on the banks of the Waikato River features just 20 suites and two cottages. \u2014 KC\n\nVancouver Island, Canada\n\nVancouver Island's rugged western coastline is perfect for expeditions.

Experienced backpackers might tackle the park\u2019s West Coast Trail. Or for more creature comforts farther north around the park\u2019s Long Beach Unit, lodges dot the coast between the laidback towns of Ucluelet and Tofino. They serve as jumping-off points for wildlife expeditions, rainforest hikes or braving the legendary surf.\n\nOne remote lodge, a floating resort previously operated as the Tofino Wilderness Resort on Quait Bay north of town, was purchased in 2022 by Ahousaht First Nation. It is expected to reopen in June 2025 with a new name and newly appointed guest rooms and public spaces.\n\nAnd for the spa-inclined, Kingfisher Pacific Resort & Spa in Courtenay on the island\u2019s east coast is debuting a six-cave experience featuring a different therapy in each \u2014 alongside visuals to enhance the circuit.\n\nButchart Gardens offers sensory stimulation in flower form.

In the winter, snowmobiles are also allowed.\n\nThe state\u2019s newest such path, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, has had a bumpy start. Devastating flooding in July 2023 caused an estimated $11 million worth of damage to the $31 million trail, delaying its grand opening by a year. It sustained some damage again in July 2024 flooding, but the 93-mile trail is nearly fully open \u2014 save for a handful of miles close to the trail\u2019s southern end and one short detour. The longest rail trail in New England, Lamoille Valley Rail Trail stretches from Swanton in the northwestern corner of the state to St. Johnsbury in the Northeast Kingdom.\n\nThere are plenty of spots to stop along the way \u2014 maybe for a beer or a bite in Morristown, where a variety of breweries, restaurants and shops are ripe for exploration, or to peek at the 150-year-old train station in Danville. \u2014 MH",

            "title": "Canada is preparing to strike back hard with retaliatory tariffs if Trump starts a trade war",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCanada is preparing to retaliate with an exhaustive list of tariffs on American goods if President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his plans to add a steep 25% import tax on Canadian goods, people familiar with the matter told CNN. The preparations show how raising tariffs could kick off a trade war that will ultimately raise prices on a number of consumer goods around the world.\n\nCanadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada, targeting items that both send a political message and inflict a reasonable amount of economic damage, two sources said.\n\nIncluded in the list of items considered for tariffs are ceramic products, steel products, furniture, certain alcoholic beverages like Bourbon and Jack Daniels whiskey, orange juice and pet food, among other goods, the people familiar with the plans told CNN. American energy exports are also on the list, and \u2013 as a last resort \u2013 Canada could levy a tax on the energy products Canada exports to the United States.\n\nBut the sources cautioned that nothing has been decided yet, and the list could ultimately change or not be imposed at all.\n\n\u201cI think we have to be ready,\u201d said Melanie Joly, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, during a press briefing in Ottawa Friday, as she was going into a cabinet meeting to discuss the list of retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\u201cI think that when President Trump talks, we listen, and we need to take him very seriously,\u201d Joly said, adding that it was important for the president-elect and the people advising him to know there would be consequences if he imposes tariffs on Canadian products and that Canada has \u201cleverage.\u201d\n\nThe tariffs could deal a blow to Canadian businesses, which are preparing for a trade war with the United States, according to Goldy Hyder, CEO of the Business Council of Canada. Hyder told CNN that his membership, which includes Canada\u2019s top CEOs, have only recently been consulted by the government and are being asked for input on retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe need to carefully articulate how we would respond,\u201d Hyder said. \u201cSome have said we should just simply mirror their tariffs, others have said we should be more temperate in our response to get their attention, others have said we should \u2018swing big\u2019 and respond with great strength.\u201d\n\nHyder told CNN that Canadian business leaders have been preparing for a Trump presidency for nearly a year, but he noted that the implications of each strategy are still being analyzed.\n\nA budding trade war\n\nThe announcement seemed designed to show that Ottawa is unafraid to get into a full-blown trade war, one that would deliver real economic pain to US workers, firms and allies of Trump.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced plans to resign earlier this week, following a mounting set of crises, including tariff threats from Trump.\n\nAs Canada has faced an intensifying political crisis, Trump has piled even more pressure on the longtime US friend and ally.\n\nTrump has vowed to impose 25% tariffs on Canada on his first day in office unless Ottawa addresses his concerns about the flow of illegal drugs across the border.\n\nTrump has argued that the best way for Canada to avoid the pain of US tariffs would be to join the United States.\n\n\u201cIf Canada merged with the US, there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday.\n\nCanada is the United States\u2019 largest trading partner. The United States imported $419 billion worth of Canadian goods in 2023, including everything from lumber and cement to cars and minerals. Canada is also the largest source of foreign oil into the United States.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Trump would not rule out using \u201ceconomic force\u201d to make a merger with Canada possible and said the United States doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d anything made in Canada.\n\n\u201cThey have a very small military. They rely on our military. It\u2019s fine, but they\u2019ve got to pay for that,\u201d Trump said.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nMeta is ending its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, known as DEI, the company said Friday, becoming the latest company to pull back from such practices in the wake of pressure from conservative critics and customers.\n\nMeta is eliminating the company\u2019s DEI team, ending \u201cequity and inclusion programs and changing hiring and supplier diversity practices,\u201d according to a company memo obtained by CNN and sent to all global employees by Meta\u2019s vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the contents of the memo.\n\n\u201cThe legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\u201d Gale wrote. \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics.\u201d\n\nGale also wrote that the term \u201cDEI\u201d has become \u201ccharged\u201d because some believe it suggests \u201cpreferential treatment of some groups over others.\u201d\n\nThe memo was first reported by Axios.\n\nMeta\u2019s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, will take on a new role focused on \u201caccessibility and engagement,\u201d the memo said. The company will also no longer require managers source candidates from unrepresented groups, and it will end efforts to hire minority-owned vendors and suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe build the best teams with the most talented people,\u201d Gale wrote. \u201cThis means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender etc.),\u201d Gale wrote.\n\n\u201cInstead of equity and inclusion programs,\u201d Gale wrote, Meta plans to build programs \u201cthat focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d\n\nThe end to the DEI programs dovetails with other major changes at the company that critics say cater to the right since President-elect Donald Trump won November\u2019s election. Earlier this week Meta announced it was ending its third-party fact-checking programs in the United States and changing its hateful conduct policies, adding new types of content users can now post on Meta-owned platforms that were previously banned.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with President-elect Donald Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, two sources familiar tell CNN. Meta declined to comment on the meeting between Zuckerberg and Trump.\n\nAnd Zuckerberg also appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast that same day, saying he\u2019d been working on the changes announced this week \u201cfor a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole point of social media is giving people the ability to share what they want. It goes back to, our original mission is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg said he\u2019s been on a \u201cjourney\u201d over the past decade, starting out \u201cvery pro-free speech, free expression,\u201d but the 2016 victory of President Donald Trump and then pressure from the Biden administration to moderate Covid-19 misinformation on social media changed his view.\n\n\u201cI kind of think in 2016 and the aftermath I gave too much deference to a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying \u2018Okay, there was no way (Trump) could\u2019ve gotten elected except for misinformation. People can\u2019t actually believe this stuff,\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nZuckerberg said fact checking and content moderation got to the point that it \u201cdestroyed trust\u201d in the platform.\n\nAt the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg said Meta was heavily pressured by the Biden administration to remove content the administration saw as misinformation on the platform.\n\n\u201cBasically these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and like scream at them and curse, and it\u2019s like, these are documented, it\u2019s all kind of out there,\u201d Zuckerberg said, adding that the administration tried to get Meta to remove a meme that suggested people who get the Covid-19 vaccine would end up being part of class action lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pressure-tested on this stuff on the last 8 to 10 years with these huge institutions just pressuring us, and I feel like this is the right place to be going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Kate Sullivan and Clare Duffy contributed reporting.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nVince McMahon agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges over settlements he made on behalf of himself and World Wrestling Entertainment without properly disclosing them to the company\u2019s board of directors, the SEC announced Friday.\n\nMcMahon, the former chief executive of WWE, made two settlement payments to women in 2019 and 2022 on behalf of himself and WWE without properly disclosing them to the WWE board of directors, legal department or accountants, the SEC said.\n\nThe undisclosed settlement payments caused issues with WWE\u2019s financial accounting and disclosures, the SEC added. WWE is owned currently by TKO Group Holdings, a company that went public in 2023.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings of wrongdoing, McMahon agreed to pay a $400,000 civil penalty in addition to reimbursing the WWE just over $1.3 million, according to the SEC.\n\nIn one of the undisclosed settlements, McMahon paid a former employee $3 million for her to agree not to disclose her relationship with McMahon or make claims against him or the WWE, the SEC said. In the other undisclosed settlement, McMahon paid an independent contractor $7.5 million for her not to disclose allegations against McMahon, the SEC said.\n\nBecause McMahon did not disclose the settlements with the company, it overstated net income in 2018 by about 8% and net income in 2021 by about 1.7%, according to the SEC.\n\n\u201cDoing so circumvented WWE\u2019s system of internal accounting controls and caused material misstatements in WWE\u2019s 2018 and 2021 financial statements,\u201d the SEC said. WWE reissued its financial statements in August 2022 after learning of McMahon\u2019s settlement agreements.\n\n\u201cThere was never anything more to this than minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments that I made several years ago while I was CEO of WWE,\u201d McMahon said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I can now put all this behind me.\u201d\n\nWWE and TKO Group Holdings did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cCompany executives cannot enter into material agreements on behalf of the company they serve and withhold that information from the company\u2019s control functions and auditor,\u201d Thomas P. Smith Jr., the associate regional director in the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office said in the agency\u2019s press release.\n\nMcMahon has been embattled in recent years with allegations of sexual misconduct. In October, McMahon and his wife Linda, who is president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for Education Secretary, were named in a lawsuit alleging the McMahon\u2019s knowingly enabled the sexual abuse of children by a WWE employee in the 1980s.\n\nLaura Brevetti, an attorney for Linda McMahon, called the allegations false.\n\n\u201cThis civil lawsuit based upon thirty-plus year-old allegations is filled with scurrilous lies, exaggerations and misrepresentations regarding Linda McMahon,\u201d Brevetti said. \u201cMs. McMahon will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit and without doubt ultimately succeed.\u201d\n\nJessica Rosenberg, an attorney for Vince McMahon, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment for this story. Rosenberg said in a previous statement that the lawsuit\u2019s allegations are false.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported in 2022 McMahon had paid more than $12 million to four women to cover up \u201callegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, McMahon stepped down as CEO of WWE and the following year paid a multimillion-dollar settlement to Rita Chatterton, a former employee and referee, who accused McMahon of raping her in 1986. McMahon returned to WWE\u2019s board in January 2023.\n\n\u201cMr. McMahon denies and always has denied raping Ms. Chatterton. And he settled the case solely to avoid the cost of litigation,\u201d Jerry McDevitt, a lawyer for McMahon, told the Journal at the time.\n\nIn January 2024, McMahon stepped down as chairman of TKO, WWE\u2019s parent company, following allegations of sexual assault and trafficking. McMahon has denied the allegations.",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s not just McDonald\u2019s that is giving its menu a budget-friendly makeover. Other chains have also recently rolled out discounts, signaling that the fast food value meal wars are from over.\n\nDunkin\u2019, KFC, Subway, Taco Bell and Wendy\u2019s have all debuted new promotions this month, continuing last year\u2019s theme that affordability rules in enticing inflation-weary consumers turned off by rising prices back to their restaurants.\n\nThe biggest promotion is at McDonald\u2019s: This week it launched the \u201cMcValue\u201d menu, a new permanent category representing the chain\u2019s biggest change since the 2018 launch of its $1-$2-$3 menu. In addition to the popular $5 meal, the McValue menu has buy-one, get-one-for-$1 options, as well as app-exclusive offers and food and drink deals organized by its franchisees.\n\nAnd with the first few months of the year typically the slowest for fast food chains, there\u2019s extra pressure to get people to order. Next month begins a fresh tranche of earnings from the publicly traded chains giving investors a look into whether their efforts are succeeding.\n\n\u201cWith continued consumer pullback, fast food chains continue to look for ways to jump-start traffic and find some avenues for growth,\u201d David Henkes, senior principal at food industry research firm Technomic, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly a continuation of what we were seeing last year as opposed to any type of new dynamic.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s new on menus:\n\nDunkin\u2019\n\nDunkin\u2019 added a new $5 breakfast meal deal. Included in the all-day deal are two breakfast wraps and a 14-ounce hot coffee or 24-ounce iced coffee.\n\nHowever, the change angered some of its fans, since it replaced a $6 meal deal that included a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich; hash browns; and a medium hot or iced coffee. Some people on social media complained that the new meal offers less food for a similar price and are asking the chain to bring back the previous option.\n\nDunkin' added a $5 meal replacing a similar $6 deal. Gary Hershorn/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nKFC\n\nKFC is kicking off the year with $5 bowls, a selection of five options including one that has mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, cheese and chicken nuggets. Other options include macaroni and cheese with nuggets or fries, coleslaw and nuggets drizzled with a hot sauce.\n\nA previous $5 meal deal attempt didn\u2019t resonate with consumers, forcing the chain to look for alternatives and better compete against trendier chicken chains, like Wingstop and Raising Cane\u2019s.\n\nSubway\n\nSubway\u2019s added a new \u201cMeal of the Day\u201d menu that changes daily. Priced at $6.99 for a specific six-inch sub or $9.99 for a footlong, all meals include a small drink and two cookies or a bag of chips.\n\nSubway is hoping that this pivot will be more successful than its last attempt at a value meal. A $6.99 meal last year that included any six-inch sub with a drink and cookies or chips ended earlier than planned because of lackluster sales.\n\nSubway is hoping its \"Meal of the Day\" deal is more successful than its previous offer. Gerardo Mora/Getty Images\n\nTaco Bell\n\nThe taco chain is having so much success with its $7 \u201cLuxe Cravings Box\u201d that it\u2019s expanding it with two new price points at $5 and $9.\n\nAimed at \u201cpost-holiday budget-savvy fans,\u201d a press release highlighted that the new options all have Taco Bell staples like burritos, tacos and cinnamon twists. The new options land on menus January 16 and last through early June.\n\nWendy\u2019s\n\nWendy\u2019s rolled out a new \u201c2 for $7\u201d limited-time offer that lets customers choose from four options, including a spicy or classic chicken sandwich, a hamburger or 10-piece nuggets, giving people 16 different ways to mix and match.\n\nThe new category joins other deals on the menu: the $5 \u201cBiggie Bag\u201d and 2 for $3 breakfast bundles. The 2 for $7 deal is on sale until early March.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nHistorical treasures hidden for decades have been uncovered in the crypts of a cathedral, with items including burial crowns and insignia belonging to Medieval European rulers.\n\nThe cache from Vilnius Cathedral, in Lithuania, has not been seen since the outbreak of World War II in 1939, according to a press release from Go Vilnius tourism promotion agency on Wednesday.\n\nItems include a crown belonging to Alexander Jagiellon, or Aleksandras Jogailaitis, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who lived from 1461\u20131506.\n\nOther artifacts include a crown, a chain, a medallion, a ring and a coffin plaque belonging to Elizabeth of Austria, or El\u017ebieta Habsburgait\u0117, who lived from 1436\u20131505.\n\nThe burial insignia were recovered from a hiding place where they were stored in 1939. Go Vilnius\n\nThere was also a crown, a scepter, an orb, three rings, a chain and coffin plaques associated with Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, or Barbora Radvilait\u0117. She was married to Sigismund II Augustus, or \u017dygimantas Augustas, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and died in 1551.\n\n\u201cThe discovered burial insignia of the monarchs of Lithuania and Poland are priceless historical treasures, symbols of the long tradition of Lithuanian statehood, signs of Vilnius as the capital city, and magnificent works of goldsmithing and jewellery,\u201d said Vilnius Archbishop Gintaras Gru\u0161as in a statement sent to CNN by the Vilnius Archdiocese on Thursday.\n\nThe artifacts would have been put inside the sarcophagi of the royals when they were laid to rest, and the crowns would not have been worn, instead being made after death to form part of the burial tomb, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the burial and honouring practices of the time,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cThis discovery is of particular importance for our statehood, as it shows the location of Vilnius Cathedral as the necropolis of the elite of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\u201d\n\nThe artifacts will go on display after being restored. Go Vilnius\n\n\u201cThese symbols are important both for the State and for each of us, as signs of European identity, as a reclaimed identity of the old State, as a sign of the strength of our roots,\u201d said Rita Pauliukevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, director of the Vilnius Church Heritage Museum, in the Archdiocese statement.\n\nThe items were first discovered in 1931 when the cathedral was being cleaned following a spring flood, revealing a crypt containing the remains of the rulers.\n\nThey were put on display until World War II broke out in 1939, when they were hidden. Several fruitless searches were carried out before researchers turned their attention to the crypts in September 2024.\n\nUsing an endoscopic camera, the artifacts were finally recovered in December, wrapped in newspapers dated September 1939.\n\n\u201cThey will be examined, restored and presented to the public in the future,\u201d according to the archdiocese.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nCoco Chanel, possibly apocryphally, once said: \u201cBefore you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off,\u201d establishing the idea that, in her eyes, to be overdressed was a fashion faux pas.\n\nIt\u2019s a commandment that has informed many fashion houses for decades; take the monochromatic styling of Issey Miyake, or the clean leatherwork of Herm\u00e8s. Muted, neutral tones, simple silhouettes and chic fabrics have previously found favor in the fashion world thanks to the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d aesthetic, made even more visible by shows like HBO\u2019s boardroom drama \u201cSuccession.\u201d (HBO and CNN are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nYet recent runway shows by the likes of Valentino, Prada and Ashish indicate maximalist fashion \u2014 a style with roots as far back as 17th century Rome \u2014 might be staging a loud return. The economic timing certainly feels right too, as maximalism movements often bubble up around times of sustained economic hardship, such as the one gripping much of the post-Covid-19 world right now.\n\nAlessandro Michele's first collection as creative director of Valentino in September 2024 was maximalist's dream, with clashing patterns, textiles and overloaded accessories. Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Melissa Marra-Alvarez, curator of the 2019 exhibition \u201cMinimalism/Maximalism\u201d at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York explained it thus: \u201cIn the broadest terms, if we look back at fashion history, we can see alternating periods of minimalist and maximalist aesthetics in fashion. It is the back-and-forth nature of these two opposing aesthetics that propels fashion forward.\n\n\u201cEvery time an aesthetic re-appears it is not only expressing the social and political climate of the moment \u2014 it is also reacting to what came before it,\u201d Marra-Alvarez added. \u201cFor this reason, it\u2019s never the same iteration of minimalist or maximalist expression. It evolves every time.\u201d\n\nIndeed the current maximalist movement, popularized on social media, is more extreme and theatrical than ever before. It also brings the look to a whole new demographic that may not have previously experienced earlier iterations of the style.\n\nJaclyn posts videos of her building maximalist outfits on TikTok under the name @llolfashiondump. lolfashiondump\n\nHer eclectic, mis-matched style has garnered her a social media following of over 1.2 million. lolfashiondump\n\nJaclyn goes by @llolfashiondump on TikTok and has 1.2 million followers. In a Zoom interview with CNN, she said that, for her, maximalism is a way to be \u201clike a walking shrine of my art\u201d \u2014 it has become a physical embodiment of her creativity. Through her popular \u201cget dressed with me\u201d videos (which average 200,000 views and can sometimes reach up to 4 million people) Jaclyn challenges the conventions of clothing, wearing jumpers upside down, attaching various accoutrements and layering endless accessories. It\u2019s a style that at times seems cumbersome, presenting its own challenges and needing dedicated sewing techniques. Yet, she said, this is all part of the fun.\n\nMyra Magdalen is another prominent TikToker in the maximalist space, who joined a Zoom call with CNN wearing a top embroidered with an image of nail clippers. She has encountered similar issues with attaching heavier embellishments to her outfits, like dolphin lamps or computer mice. The solution? \u201cMultiple (points of) anchoring,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to attach something, especially if it\u2019s heavy, you need to have it where if one point of attachment fails it will not fall off.\u201d\n\nBoth Jaclyn and Myra enjoy experimenting with bold statement pieces like long nails and decorative headphones. But for those looking to dip their toes into maximalism, fashion stylist Kristine Kilty suggests picking up a statement piece from a thrift store and using the color palette to inform the rest of the outfit. Finding inspiration photos on social media can also combat some of the anxiety people might feel during their first foray into a more experimental style of fashion, said the creative director, who focuses on maximalism, over Zoom. Most importantly, she added, \u201cmore is more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really go wrong\u2026 It\u2019s not that the outfit isn\u2019t working. You just haven\u2019t finished it yet,\u201d she said.\n\nMyra's unusual outfits are often thematic and she regularly styles household items as fashion accessories. Myra Magdalen\n\nMyra's creative accessorizing have seen her fastening dolphin lamps to her shirt and headphones. Myra Magdalen\n\nWhen curating their wardrobes, the US-based Myra and Jaclyn both rely heavily on secondhand clothes, whether from in-person shopping in thrift stores or online platforms like Depop and Vinted. The algorithms have adapted to their unusual tastes, helping Myra find unique pieces \u2014 such as a jacket resembling a computer keyboard \u2014 to complete her looks. In videos styling these pieces, Myra takes a statement item, like a DIY duck bag, and adds seemingly-endless matching accessories including a duck-patterned skirt, a duck neck necklace and press-on miniature duck nails.\n\nBoth TikTokers say their creativity is well-received not only on social media but also in real life. While Myra and Jaclyn know when to dress down in jeans and a simple T-shirt, they enjoy the spectacle of wearing bold outfits in public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a positive feeling to have confidence in what you do,\u201d said Jaclyn, who admitted that her maximalist clothing originally acted as a mask for insecurities stemming from psoriasis \u2014 wearing unusual clothing blurred the reasons behind peoples\u2019 stares. \u201cIt radiates into so many other aspects of your life,\u201d she said. Myra\u2019s unique approach to fashion has also caught on among her friendship group which, she said, has become more experimental in its own sartorial choices.\n\nKilty strongly believes that people should use fashion to inspire confidence and creativity. \u201cFashion can be an armor or it can be a disguise,\u201d she said. \u201cBut ultimately, it\u2019s what you feel comfortable in.\u201d\n\nFor some, this might be sleek silhouettes in muted colors, while for others it\u2019s clashing colors and contrasting patterns. If the latter is you, Kilty had some parting words. Just \u201cgo really extreme \u2014 don\u2019t hold yourself back.\u201d",

With interviews from Reese, tennis player Frances Tiafoe and Olympic sprinter Gabby Thomas \u2014 the last of whom also received a separate cover \u2014 the story delves into why fashion brands are tapping athletes as some of their biggest stars.\n\nThough luxury labels have often tapped fashionable athletes in the past for campaigns and on-court collaborations, the relationship has been hypercharged as of late.\n\nNBA, WNBA and NFL \u201ctunnel walks\u201d have turned arenas into highly anticipated runways and, in turn, athletes have made debuts on actual runways, with Olympians Noah Lyles and Jordan Chiles making their debuts for New York Fashion Week in the fall.\n\nReese for Vogue.

            "text": "Tashkent, Uzbekistan CNN \u2014\n\nDriving through Tashkent feels like flipping through an architecture picture book teeming with examples of Soviet brutalist, orientalist, modernist, futurist and neoclassical styles. One marvel after another, buildings in Uzbekistan\u2019s capital city whiz by like a carousel for design lovers.\n\nAfter an earthquake leveled much of its infrastructure in 1966, Tashkent became a laboratory of urbanism. Architects arrived en masse to rebuild roads, apartment blocks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, metro stations and a panoply of public structures that offered different takes on progressive socialist living.\n\nToday, new landmarks designed by the firms of \u201cstarchitects\u201d such as the late Zaha Hadid and Tadao Ando are in the works, as well as an \u201cOlympic City\u201d comprising five state-of-the-art sports venues for the 2025 Asian Youth Olympic Games. Beyond the capital, the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva contain an array of ancient \u201ctoki\u201d (domed markets), \u201cmadrasa\u201d (schools) and \u201ccaravanserai\u201d (inns) built for traders who traversed the Silk Road.\n\nNow, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev\u2019s government is pouring resources into highlighting this rich architectural legacy as part of a campaign to open the former USSR republic to the world. Conservation work on its historic sites is a top priority.\n\nRegistan Square in Samarkand, which was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2001.

Andrey Khrobostov/Alamy Stock Photo\n\n\u201cBy preserving and restoring these unique architectural treasures, we position Uzbekistan as a global cultural destination,\u201d said Gayane Umerova, chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) in a statement to CNN. The investment, she added, will be paid off \u201cthrough increased tourism revenue, job creation, urban revitalization, and cultural branding, as well as preserving and reimagining our heritage in this new era.\u201d\n\nLoving and loathing brutalism\n\nReimagining a collective identity is something of a preoccupation for a nation that only gained its independence from the USSR in 1991. Within Uzbekistan, where 60% of the population is under 30 years old, not everyone is particularly enamored with vestiges of its Soviet past. Young Uzbeks often opt to live in Western-style apartments and point to the gleaming towers in the international business district, including the sprawling Tashkent City Mall, as points of pride. Inevitably, generic glass-and-steel modernity sometimes buts against preservationists\u2019 agendas. The demolition of the iconic Dom Kino cinema house \u2014 to make way for a business park \u2014 in 2017, in particular, spurred heritage advocates to action.\n\nA statue of poet Taras Shevchenko stands before a Soviet-era mosaic mural in Tashkent. Alexey Narodizkiy/Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation\n\nOver the past three years, ACDF has held 10 exhibitions in 10 countries, including shows at Paris\u2019 Louvre Museum and the Milan Triennale. It has also convened conferences (one of which was headlined by celebrated Dutch architecture theorist Rem Koolhaas and another featured experts from UNESCO, the Guggenheim, Venice Heritage and the British Council), developed a \u201cTashkent Modernism\u201d app, and commissioned a meticulously researched 900-page book titled \u201cTashkent Modernism XX/XXI.\u201d\n\nGetting influential voices outside of Uzbekistan to rally behind unloved local treasures has, historically, proven to be effective, according to Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Milan-based architect, researcher and co-editor of \u201cTashkent Modernism.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody really cared about Soviet modernism until that book by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chaubin,\u201d she said, referring to the hugely popular coffee-table book \u201cCCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions,\u201d a 2011 architectural survey of 14 former Soviet republics published by Taschen. French photographer Chaubin\u2019s travelogue, she said, spurred architectural expeditions like Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig\u2019s catalog of Soviet bus stops and Garage Museum\u2019s Soviet modernism guidebook series. \u201cPeople \u2026 started saying, \u2018If somebody is traveling from so far away and actually covering it in such a regional way, that must mean something. We might have been underestimating the relevance of this,\u2019\u201d Golovatyuk added.\n\nHotel Uzbekistan, an icon of Soviet brutalism. Alexey Narodizkiy/Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation\n\nSocial media influencers who introduce their followers to Uzbekistan\u2019s under-the-radar wonders are helping, too. \u201cIt gives visibility to this architecture and transforms it into some sort of cultural and artistic product \u2014 something that you don\u2019t perceive when you walk past it every day in the city,\u201d Golovatyuk said.\n\nSustainable architecture lab\n\nAmid the current construction boom, Uzbekistan is again serving as a magnet for progressive building ideas, just as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This time, however, the most consequential issue is sustainability.\n\nWael Al Awar, the Lebanese architect co-curating the Uzbekistan\u2019s inaugrual Bukhara Biennial, says the country\u2019s ancient cities are teeming with green solutions. Buildings are responsible for almost 40% of global carbon emissions, and Al Awar points to the \u201cstandardization and globalization in architecture\u201d as a culprit, adding that contemporary concrete buildings have also resulted in a homogenization of the world\u2019s skylines. \u201cUzbekistan\u2019s structures, in contrast, are contextual,\u201d he said \u201cThey\u2019re made by local communities who know the weather and the climate, and respond to that when they build. This is something we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\nThe famous blue dome of the Chorsu Bazaar in Tashkent. Jasmine Leung/SOPA Images/Shutterstock\n\nMost ancient buildings in Uzbekistan are naturally energy-efficient, according to Takhmina Turdialieva, co-founder of the Tashkent-based collective, Tatalab, referring to the historic public buildings and dwellings found in Uzbekistan\u2019s Silk Road cities. \u201cIt\u2019s very pleasant in the summer and (buildings stay) warm during the winter because of the choice of construction materials and well-designed air circulation. If we learn those passive design methods, we don\u2019t need any new technologies to make buildings more sustainable,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cModern architecture in Uzbekistan should be based on traditional construction materials like brick and clay,\u201d she added. \u201cWe can express different designs with those eco-friendly materials and keep traditions in mind. I think this is how we express modern Uzbek,\u201d she says.\n\nA rendering of Zaha Hadid Architects' winning design for the forthcoming Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre in New Tashkent. Norviska Maindropoff/Zaha Hadid Architects\n\nThis new vision of modernity is taking shape in New Tashkent City, a 20,000-hectare extension of Uzbekistan\u2019s capital that posits to become a locus of sustainable design ideas. Zaha Hadid Architects\u2019 winning design for the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, for instance, uses locally made bricks to achieve the firm\u2019s signature avant-garde swooping structures\n\nTurdialieva, who also leads the Young Architect\u2019s Association of Uzbekistan, adds that a global spotlight on Uzbek design could help invigorate the country\u2019s next generation of architects. \u201cMaybe this will be a starting point when more attention will be paid to local architects so they can better develop their potential,\u201d she said.",

            "title": "Analysis: The era of the running quarterback is upon us",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe quarterback position has completely changed in the NFL.\n\nI want you to think of the prototypical quarterback of yesteryear. It\u2019s probably a stiff and tall guy who stayed in the pocket and couldn\u2019t run to save his life.\n\nIndeed, one of the greatest insults you could throw at a quarterback back then was that he was a \u201crunning quarterback\u201d.\n\nThose days are gone now. The prototypical winning quarterback is one who can use his feet. And if your quarterback can\u2019t run, chances are you\u2019re going to be on the outside looking in come Super Bowl time.\n\nThink of the best quarterbacks in today\u2019s NFL \u2013 in particular Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who have been dominating the MVP conversation.\n\nBoth of them can pass the ball like nobody\u2019s business, but they also can run the ball like nobody\u2019s business.\n\nBoth have more than 500 rushing yards. Jackson leads league quarterbacks with 915, while Allen comes in fifth with 531.\n\nAllen runs with devastating effectiveness for a quarterback. He\u2019s second among league quarterbacks with 12 rushing touchdowns, and Jackson comes in tied for ninth at four. When it comes to rushing success rate (i.e. picking up first downs on third and fourth down or a good chunk of yards on first or second), Allen is second at 64.7% among those who have started at least half his team\u2019s games. Jackson is eighth 56.1%.\n\nAnd when Allen and Jackson decide to pass, they use their legs to avoid oncoming\n\npass rushers. Both are well below the league average in sack rate: Allen\u2019s second at\n\n2.82% and Jackson\u2019s fifth at 4.63% among those who have started at least half their\n\nteam\u2019s games. (Allen started seven more games than the leader, Derek Carr.)\n\nThe story of Allen and Jackson is in some ways the story of them as individuals, but it\u2019s really the story of the league at large.\n\nThere were 18 quarterbacks this season who played in at least half their team\u2019s games and picked up at least 15 yards per game. That\u2019s tied for the all-time record with the 2020 season. In fact, all five top seasons for rushing average per game have occurred in the last five seasons.\n\nPut another way, this year is no fluke. It\u2019s part of a longer-term trend towards the NFL prioritizing quarterbacks who can use their legs as well as their arm to move the ball down the field.\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson runs with the ball against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second quarter at Raymond James Stadium. Nathan Ray Seebeck/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters\n\nThey don\u2019t just run for yards either. They run for touchdowns.\n\nTen different quarterbacks ran for at least four touchdowns this year like Jackson did. Only 2023 beats that with 11. Every season with at least eight quarterbacks who ran for at least four rushing touchdowns has occurred since 2012.\n\nMany of the quarterbacks who are running for touchdowns and yards are leading the best teams. Beyond Allen and Jackson, other quarterbacks with at least four rushing touchdowns who are in the playoffs this year are Jayden Daniels (Washington), Jalen Hurts (Philadelphia), Baker Mayfield (Tampa Bay), Bo Nix (Denver) and Justin Fields (Pittsburgh).\n\nFields, it should be noted, is now \u2013 for some reason \u2013 the backup behind Russell Wilson in Pittsburgh, who is still known to scramble for yardage though not as much as he did earlier in his career.\n\nWhen you add in quarterbacks who have rushed for at least 15 yards per game, Justin\n\nHerbert (Los Angeles Chargers), Baker Mayfield (Tampa Bay) and the ever-great\n\nPatrick Mahomes (Kansas City) join the list.\n\nPut another way, there is more than a 60% chance the Super Bowl winning quarterback can be categorized as a running quarterback.\n\nMuch of that more than 60% comes from Allen, Jackson and Mahomes. I think it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that all three will eventually be in the Hall of Fame.\n\nAt this point, there are only six quarterbacks in the hall since as far back as we have\n\nstats (e.g. 1950) who have had at least three seasons where they started at least nine\n\ngames and averaged at least 15 yards rushing per game.\n\nAllen, Jackson and Mahomes all have at least six seasons a piece that meet that criterion.\n\nOf course, it would be unfair to categorize any of these three as merely running quarterbacks.\n\nAllen and Jackson are both in the top 10 in passing yards per attempt, interceptions per attempt (i.e. not throwing them) and touchdowns per attempt.\n\nBy being able to run and pass the ball, Allen and Jackson make themselves borderline unstoppable.\n\nEven in an off-year, Mahomes still scares the heck out of me as a Bills\u2019 fan. Imagine trying to chase him down. You think your defense has got him. Then he escapes out of the pocket. Do you try to tackle him or ensure all the receivers downfield are covered?\n\nNo matter what you do, it\u2019s the wrong move.\n\nThat\u2019s the magic of the running quarterback \u2013 one that is in abundance now compared to previous generations.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nOhio State defensive end Jack Sawyer once lived with Quinn Ewers. On Friday, he earned a rent-free spot in the Texas quarterback\u2019s head, stripping the ball from his former roommate and taking it 83 yards for a touchdown that sealed the Buckeyes\u2019 place in the college football national championship game.\n\nThe senior standout\u2019s strip of Ewers and subsequent rumble to put the Buckeyes up 28-14 late in the fourth quarter of Friday\u2019s College Football Playoff semifinal in the Cotton Bowl will live long in Ohio State history, the capstone to an epic goal-line stand that sent the Buckeyes to the national championship game.\n\nOhio State had taken a 21-14 lead with about seven minutes to go on another tough run from Quinshon Judkins, but Ewers and Texas looked like they had yet another answer in a brutal, physical game that had seen momentum swing back and forth. The Longhorns got to the Ohio State one-yard line and had four downs to try and punch in the tying touchdown.\n\nThe Ohio State defense, the nation\u2019s top-ranked unit, was beyond ready for the challenge.\n\nOn first down, running back Jerrick Gibson was stuffed for no gain. On second down, a pitch out wide to Quintrevion Wisner lost seven yards and the scarlet-and-gray fans at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, began to feel like something magical was about to happen. On third down, Ewers lined up in the shotgun and tried to pass for the tying score but the ball was deflected at the line and fell harmlessly incomplete.\n\nAnd on fourth down, Sawyer broke free of his blocker and tracked down his former roommate as Ewers shuffled to his left, looking into the end zone for an open receiver. Instead, the senior defensive end knocked the ball from his former roommate\u2019s hand, pushed him to the ground, picked up the bouncing ball and had nothing but open field in front of him.\n\nAs his teammates went insane next to him on the sideline, Sawyer cruised into the end zone for the score that sealed the game.\n\n\u201cI was just put in a good position by the coaches, I saw the ball pop out right to me as I tackled him. I was just thinking, \u2018I gotta stay on my feet,\u2019\u201d Sawyer told ESPN after the game. \u201cAlmost blacked out when I scooped it, saw nothin\u2019 but green grass ahead of me.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Ewers summed up the feeling succinctly: \u201cIt sucks, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard. All the work we put in, being in the final four back-to-back years and coming up short two years, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Ewers added.\n\nIt was a legendary play that sealed a remarkable turnaround for the Buckeyes during these playoffs. After a demoralizing defeat to archrival Michigan on November 30, the fourth straight loss to the Wolverines, the Ohio State fanbase faced a crisis of confidence. There were calls for head coach Ryan Day to be fired and worries that home-field advantage in the opening round of the playoffs would be lost when Tennessee fans invaded Ohio Stadium ahead of the Volunteers\u2019 game against the Buckeyes.\n\nOhio State head coach Ryan Day and quarterback Will Howard celebrate after the Cotton Bowl College Football Playoff. Gareth Patterson/AP\n\nOhio State blew away Tennessee and easily handled top-ranked Oregon in the quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl. The Cotton Bowl against Texas promised a much stiffer challenge and for much of the contest it felt like the game might come down to whoever had the ball last. Now, all that stands between them and a national championship is Notre Dame on January 20 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nOhio State\u2019s opening drive seemed like it would set the tone early, with Buckeyes\u2019 quarterback Will Howard simply picking apart the Longhorns secondary. It ended up being a strong run up the middle by Judkins that got the scoring started, putting Ohio State up 7-0 early in the first quarter.\n\nBehind its top-ranked defense, the Buckeyes refused to let Texas get into a rhythm early and it seemed like Ohio State could take a hold of the game early as Howard once again moved the offense down the field on their second possession. Texas had no answers for the Ohio State offense, but then running back Treveyon Henderson helped them out with a 15-yard personal foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. The penalty knocked the Buckeyes out of field goal range, and they\u2019d end up punting.\n\nFrom there, the game settled into a rhythm for the next quarter or so of game time. Texas kept trying to establish their run game \u2013which blew away Clemson in the opening round of the playoffs \u2013 but could not break through. Ohio State meanwhile would start to move the ball and end up with a self-inflicted drive stopper of a penalty, killing their momentum. Howard also had to play through an apparent injury to his non-throwing hand, as ESPN\u2019s cameras showed a golf-ball-sized knot forming after an apparent collision with a Texas defender.\n\nTexas finally got some momentum at the end of the first half with a touchdown drive that tied the game. Arch Manning, the high-profile backup to Ewers, entered the game to pick up a key fourth-down conversation. On the next play, Ewers passed to Silas Bolden, who broke a tackle for a 24-yard gain to the OSU 18-yard line. Two plays later, Ewers hit running back Jaydon Blue with a looping pass that fell perfectly in stride for the tying touchdown.\n\nIt looked like the Longhorns were going to head to the locker room with the wind at its back, but the Buckeyes stole the momentum right back right before halftime. Henderson took a short screen pass and weaved through the second level of the defense, patiently following his offensive line. Suddenly has nothing but open field in front of him. He ran 75 yards, untouched, to put the Buckeyes back on top heading into the half.\n\nMalik Hartford of the Ohio State Buckeyes celebrates in the fourth quarter against the Texas Longhorns. Alex Slitz/Getty Images\n\nThey couldn\u2019t keep that momentum going after the break though \u2013 Howard threw an interception on the opening possession of the second half and the teams once again traded punts for much of the third quarter before Ewers once again found Blue for a long touchdown, this time going for 26 yards.\n\nIt was a carbon copy of the first Texas touchdown as Blue ran a wheel route out of the backfield and found himself wide open in the Ohio State secondary. Blue made one man miss and eased into the end zone to tie the game at 14 with 3:12 left in the third quarter. It was a perfect answer to Ohio State\u2019s blitz, as the Texas coaching staff and Ewers adjusted to the pressure the Buckeyes had brought in the first half that stymied so much of Texas\u2019 offense.\n\nOhio State searched for an answer but couldn\u2019t stop shooting themselves in their collective feet. Howard started off the next drive with a 15-yard completion that was immediately wiped out by a personal foul penalty for a late hit by offensive lineman Austin Siereveld. The penalty proved to be yet another drive killer and Ohio State punted after failing to get anything going against an increasingly confident Texas defense.\n\nThe solution to the offensive malaise for the Buckeyes as the fourth quarter dawned was to simply start to cut Howard loose. Ohio State offensive coordinator Chip Kelly called multiple deep shots as the Buckeyes got the ball early in the final frame, with varying levels of success. A drive full of passes set up the key play on the drive \u2013 on fourth and three from the Texas 34, Howard dropped back to pass and then tucked the ball and ran for 18 yards, picking up a key first down that could have been the go-ahead touchdown if Howard didn\u2019t stumble.\n\nQuinshon Judkins of the Ohio State Buckeyes runs with the ball past Malik Muhammad #5 of the Texas Longhorns in the fourth quarter during the Goodyear Cotton Bowl at AT&T Stadium on January 10. Alex Slitz/Getty Images\n\nFour plays later, it was Judkins powering into the end zone to put Ohio State up 21-14 with a little more than seven minutes to play.\n\nIt looked like Texas had the answer as Ewers drove his team down the field, getting down to the Ohio State one yard line. But then the Buckeyes made their stand, with Sawyer putting the dagger into the Longhorns.\n\n\u201cIt was a really nice drive by the offense to get all the way down there. And first and goal on the one and we don\u2019t score? You know, quite frankly, you probably don\u2019t deserve to win that way,\u201d Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian said later.\n\nFor Ohio State, it became a moment to celebrate a new school legend.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough about Jack Sawyer,\u201d Day told ESPN after the game. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who loves being a Buckeye. He loves his teammates. He\u2019s done everything that\u2019s asked him to do. He\u2019s a captain. He\u2019s everything that we could possibly ask for in a captain. To make a play like that in that moment \u2026 you want to leave a legacy behind? You become a legend. He just became a legend at Ohio State.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFrench tennis star Ga\u00ebl Monfils became the oldest ever player to claim an ATP Tour singles title when he won the ASB Classic in Auckland on Saturday, surpassing the previous record set by Roger Federer in 2019.\n\nThe 38-year-old won the ATP 250 tournament after defeating Belgium\u2019s Zizou Bergs 6-3 6-4 in the final to claim his 13th tour-level title.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot (to win). Age is a number,\u201d said Monfils in his on-court interview afterwards. \u201cBut we keep working. I keep believing that I can play high-quality tennis and I have been showing it this week so I am very happy.\n\n\u201c(My first title) was 20 years ago. I still have the passion to play tennis.

            "title": "Democrats search for a leader to rebuild as the party figures out what comes next",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAs Democrats head toward an uncertain future under a second Trump administration, the party\u2019s search for a new leader to help rebuild the party also remains unsettled.\n\nThe process of choosing a new Democratic National Committee chair kicked off Saturday, when eight candidates met virtually in the first party-run forum of the race. With three weeks to go before the February 1 election, no candidate has locked up support from a majority of the 448 party insiders who\u2019ll choose the next party leader.\n\nThe chair race marks the first major decision Democrats will make after facing disastrous losses in last year\u2019s general election. The contest to lead the party, and the various unofficial forums and small group meetings that preceded Saturday\u2019s event, have become a space for Democrats to hash out what went wrong, how to reach the voters who abandoned the party in November and how the millions of dollars spent in lost swing states might have been better used.\n\nDespite early reports that some high-profile names were considering joining the race, the current field of eight candidates \u2013 led by Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin, Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley \u2013 is made up of figures who are not well known nationally.\n\nFor many DNC members, that\u2019s a bonus.\n\n\u201cThe vibe I get is that people are super hungry for an operative chair,\u201d said one DNC member who is part of a state delegation. \u201cWe want workhorses.\u201d\n\nThe DNC is made up of a mix of state party leaders and committee people, members of allied Democratic groups, union leaders and at-large members appointed by the current chair. The largest bloc consists of the state party leaders, who have made investments in their states a key issue.\n\nSolidifying support from state party chairs and vice chairs, who make up about 114 members of the DNC and have influence over their state delegations, could prove key to winning a race where no candidate has locked up a majority of support.\n\nThe DNC will hold three additional forums: one in Detroit on January 16 focused on the Midwest; one virtually on January 23 focused on the West; and a final in-person event in Washington, DC, on January 30, focused on the East.\n\nSaturday\u2019s forum focused on the issues of the South.\n\nChristale Spain, the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party who is still deciding who she\u2019ll back in the February 1 election, said she wanted to know the candidates\u2019 plans for funding a \u201cSouthern strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just cannot concede ground because it\u2019s hard,\u201d Spain said ahead of the forum. \u201cWe can win in the South, but it\u2019s just going to take a long-term investment.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, the candidates discussed their plans to invest in Southern states through recruitment, messaging and more funding for state parties.\n\n\u201cWhen I say we have to focus on a 10-year strategy which rejects Southern political disinvestment, it\u2019s not a platitude \u2014 it\u2019s mission-critical,\u201d Martin said.\n\nMany DNC members are hoping now is the time to shake up not just how funds are distributed but how the party operates broadly. The last time Democrats were able to elect a DNC chair \u2013 in 2017, after Donald Trump first won the White House \u2013 the party instituted major reforms to address the concerns of progressives who backed independent Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThis time around, candidates are being pressed on messaging to working class voters, holding consultants accountable and investing in state parties frustrated by the disparity between the amount of money that went into battleground states and what could have been spent to make their races more competitive.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say how much support any candidate has. The DNC doesn\u2019t publicly release its member lists, and no campaigns have released full lists of their endorsements.\n\nAccording to the campaigns of the leading candidates, Martin has \u201cwell over 100\u201d endorsements; O\u2019Malley has \u201c60+ and counting\u201d; New York state Sen. James Skoufis has 23 endorsements; and Wikler has declined to release numbers.\n\nIn addition to Martin, Wikler, O\u2019Malley and Skoufis, four other candidates have gathered enough signatures to appear at the Saturday forum: former congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; attorney and political strategist Jason Paul; Nate Snyder, a former US Department of Homeland Security official; and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson.\n\nDeep ties\n\nMartin \u2013 who has been a state party chair since 2011 and now chairs the Association of State Democratic Committees \u2013 has the deepest ties to state party leaders. In interviews, chairs who\u2019ve endorsed him said he\u2019s been a constant presence over the years, providing insight, aiding with fundraising and traveling through their states with them.\n\nEarlier this month, Martin campaigned in northern Virginia on behalf of candidates running in special elections for an open state House and Senate seat. Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said he also visited Virginia in the fall to campaign for congressional candidates and in 2021 when Democrats lost the governorship.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I love about Ken is he shows up and is ready to do the hard work,\u201d Swecker said.\n\nRuss Carnahan, a former US representative who now leads the Missouri Democratic Party, said Martin had been instrumental in helping the party rebuild when Carnahan took over in 2023. As the race unfolded, Carnahan suggested to his state\u2019s delegation that they vote as a bloc.\n\n\u201cAbout three minutes into the meeting, everybody was like, \u2018Well, this is a no brainer: Ken,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what he\u2019s done in his own state, we know what he\u2019s done nationally, and we know what he\u2019s done very substantially to help us in Missouri.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Wikler pointed to his work with his colleagues. In 2021, the Wisconsin Democratic Party donated $300,000 to the Florida Democratic Party to help them pay for staff health insurance. Wikler also advised entrepreneur and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman to send funds to the Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina and Ohio state parties, according to the spokesperson.\n\nAllies of Martin have portrayed Wikler as too closely tied to donors at a time when Democrats are questioning the party\u2019s ties to the consultant class. But the Wisconsin Democrat\u2019s supporters note that whoever leads the party must be able to fundraise \u2013 an area where Wikler has excelled. In 2024, his state party raised nearly $62 million, more than any other state party committee.\n\nLavora Barnes, the outgoing chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said she was endorsing Wikler because of the work he\u2019d done building up the state party in Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been helpful to me to have Ben to call to bounce ideas off of, to share thoughts, to occasionally commiserate with \u2013 and Ben has done the same with me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been truly able to help each other through some tough moments during these campaigns.\u201d\n\nWide open race\n\nAs the race heads into its final weeks, Barnes argued that DNC members are still weighing their options.\n\n\u201cI think that everyone who is watching this should consider it an open race, that there are still votes to be gotten, and that Ben is going to do all he can to get each and every one of those votes,\u201d she said.\n\nNo candidate has claimed as many private endorsements or released as many public ones as Martin \u2013 including endorsements from eight state delegations and the party chairs of seven additional states. But other campaigns say the Minnesotan also failed to secure enough votes to lock up the office and expect that no candidate will win a majority of ballots during the first round of voting.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s been able to run away with it over the past two months,\u201d Skoufis said.\n\nOthers have pointed to the news that the Association of State Democratic Committees, the group Martin chairs that represents the largest voting bloc in the DNC, decided this week not to endorse a candidate.\n\nThose arguing the race is still fluid have also pointed to the news this week that the ASDC, the group of which Wikler is a member, decided not to endorse. While Martin\u2019s supporters said state party leaders felt choosing would not be conducive to party unity, backers of other campaigns said it was a sign there are votes to be won among the ASDC\u2019s ranks.\n\n\u201cThat says that they are still open, and they\u2019re still looking,\u201d former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, an O\u2019Malley supporter who cannot vote in the DNC election, told CNN. \u201cI think that there is an opportunity, clearly, for someone to make their case.\u201d\n\nAnother DNC member, who said they are considering Martin and Wikler while \u201ckeeping an open mind\u201d about O\u2019Malley, said their colleagues were \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d by the field.\n\n\u201cI do think a lot of folks who are keeping their powder dry are still waiting to see if somebody else jumps in,\u201d they said. \u201cIf there is somebody else with any sort of stature who is compelling or inspiring it shouldn\u2019t be that hard for them to make the ballot.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump\u2019s border czar Tom Homan has privately told Republican lawmakers to temper their expectations for the incoming administration\u2019s initial deportation operation, citing limited resources, according to multiple sources involved in the conversations.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s allies have floated measures to detain and deport people residing in the US illegally, the plans largely depend on the resources and funds available to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which historically has had budget shortfalls.\n\n\u201cWe are not having a discussion about 20 million (deportations). We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation,\u201d GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, who was in one of the meetings with Homan, told CNN.\n\nThe discussions are part of a broader level-setting that is occurring among House Republicans, who are now coming to terms with the challenges of turning one of their key campaign promises into a reality. Republicans are also grappling with the harsh realization that most of their border overhaul measures are unlikely to be included in Trump\u2019s massive agenda bill, given the strict rules around the reconciliation process that require proposals to either increase revenue or reduce spending, not change policy.\n\n\u201cMany members are only now beginning to understand that,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN.\n\nTrump has vowed to launch the largest deportation operation in history, telling Time Magazine in December he believes there will be \u201cprobably 15 and maybe as many as 20 million\u201d undocumented immigrants in the US by the time he takes office.\n\nIn recent meetings with House Republicans, Homan, a veteran of immigration enforcement, has outlined a tiered approach to Trump\u2019s mass deportation pledge, according to lawmakers and sources involved in the discussions.\n\nHoman and lawmakers are using current government funding levels to craft a plan that targets between 1 and 2 million undocumented immigrants who are eligible for removal as quickly as possible, according to multiple sources in the discussions. There are currently about 1.4 million people in the US with final immigration orders of removal.\n\n\u201cHoman has been telling some of the members that \u2018Hey, if you want me to do all these things that you\u2019re talking about, this costs money, and it\u2019s not being done with the CR that\u2019s in place now,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN, referring to the continuing budget resolution that simply extends the current level of DHS funding.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families. The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition team told CNN in a statement.\n\nAnother GOP lawmaker whose committee oversees the Department of Homeland Security budget told CNN that Homan is trying to work as fast as the confines of the system allow.\n\n\u201cHis message is not code talk for, \u2018Nothing is going to happen\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019re going to slow down\u2019 or whatever. But it is a responsible policy approach to getting stuff done quickly, but also in the context of realistic evaluation of how to best get that done and fulfill the promises that the incoming administration has made,\u201d GOP Rep. Mark Amodei told CNN.\n\nHoman has repeatedly stressed that he remains focused on public safety and national security threats, but hasn\u2019t ruled out that others who are in the US illegally but do not pose a safety threat could be swept up in deportations.\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Homan said he would need a minimum of 100,000 beds to detain undocumented immigrants \u2014 more than doubling the 40,000 detention beds ICE is currently funded for \u2014 and would require more ICE agents. The agency has around 6,000 immigration enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the funding I get from the Hill,\u201d Homan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Source.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t specify how many undocumented immigrants he hopes to see deported by the end of Trump\u2019s next four years in office.\n\nSome Republicans told CNN they have gotten the funding message.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to need money right away,\u201d GOP Rep. Andy Biggs told CNN.\n\nBut many lawmakers are acknowledging that getting Homan the funding he would need to undertake an unprecedented deportation effort would be extremely challenging.\n\nRepublicans are trying to massively cut government spending across the board, yet all parties involved acknowledge that increasing deportations will cost significantly more than what the government has currently allocated.\n\nAccording to an initial estimate by the American Immigration Council, deporting 1 million people per year would cost approximately $88 billion annually and $960 billion over a 10-year period. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 271,484 immigrants last fiscal year under President Joe Biden, marking the highest level of deportations since 2014, according to an annual report. Former President Barack Obama deported around 400,000 in one year, but a large number of those were people who had only recently crossed the border. Trump faces a steeper challenge in targeting those already in the country.\n\nYet with the next government funding deadline two months away, top House appropriators tell CNN they haven\u2019t even been given top-line numbers to begin working with, making their ability to plan how to scale up funding for deportations that much more challenging.\n\n\u201cWhile there may be some private discussions going on, nobody is talking publicly right now about March 14. And it\u2019s going to get here pretty soon. We\u2019re right at two months away. We need to fund this government,\u201d GOP Rep. Steve Womack, a senior House GOP appropriator, told CNN. \u201cIt will be unacceptable for us to blame our inaction that we just ran out of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will cost a lot to deport,\u201d Biggs told CNN. \u201cBut guess what? It will also save a lot. And it\u2019ll be a net benefit.\u201d\n\nBut despite all of the pitfalls ahead, Republicans know they have to start somewhere, and argue that once the deportations under Trump start, there is a serious likelihood that undocumented immigrants will self-deport. There is also an acknowledgment that Trump\u2019s expected executive orders will do a lot to get the process of addressing deportations, closing down the border and overhauling the immigration system started. Republicans also say there is a serious need to address staffing at ICE and secure enough detention beds.\n\nGroups of Republicans are scheduled to be at Mar-a-Lago this weekend to meet with Trump directly and are looking for direction and an honest conversation about what\u2019s next.\n\nGOP Rep. Clay Higgins, part of one of the groups expected to meet with Trump this weekend, said while Trump may see the challenges ahead, it\u2019s not stopping him from aiming high.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018I understand the complications. Work through them. Make it happen. I want it done yesterday,\u2019\u201d Higgins said of Trump\u2019s mindset.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump was sentenced without penalty in the New York hush money case Friday after a symbolic \u2013 and historic and unprecedented \u2013 hearing following the first felony conviction of a former and soon-to-be sitting president.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan spoke to Trump for several minutes, telling the president-elect that it was the office of the presidency \u2013 and not the occupant \u2013 that was afforded extraordinary legal protections requiring him to impose a sentence of unconditional discharge without any punishment.\n\nTrump chose to speak before Merchan imposed his sentence, showing zero contrition and launching into the same attacks against the \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d that he\u2019s been claiming since he was first indicted more than 20 months ago.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records. While he has vowed to keep fighting the conviction through the appeals courts, Friday\u2019s sentencing cements the fact that Trump will be the first convicted felon to become president 10 days from now.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know from the hearing:\n\nAn unprecedented sentencing\n\nMerchan already signaled he would not sentence Trump to any punishment, let alone jail time. That\u2019s something the US Supreme Court noted when it allowed the hearing to go forward in a 5-4 ruling Thursday night, over Trump\u2019s objections.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t make Friday\u2019s sentencing any less significant or embarrassing for Trump, who was allowed to appear virtually from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s sentencing, Trump\u2019s tone was perhaps more subdued while speaking over a virtual connection, but he nevertheless railed for several minutes against everyone involved in the case \u2013 the prosecutors, the judge, Michael Cohen and more \u2013 claiming he has been treated unfairly.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Judge Merchan speak to Trump: 'A factor that overrides all others' 01:23 - Source: CNN\n\n\u201cThis has been a very terrible experience,\u201d Trump said at one point.\n\nTrump concluded his speech by noting that the voters had put him back in office, even ticking off the fact that he won all seven swing states and the popular vote.\n\nThe voters had \u201cbeen watching your trial so they understood it,\u201d the president-elect said, implying that the case helped return him to the White House.\n\nJudge focuses on protections of \u2018office of the presidency\u2019\n\nMerchan did not criticize Trump\u2019s conduct as he sentenced him, instead focusing on the judge\u2019s difficult task of imposing a sentence and the legal reasons why he was not imposing any punishment in the case.\n\nMerchan noted that the circumstances surrounding this case were extraordinary \u2013 but said that once the courtroom doors closed, it proceeded like any other trial in the New York court system.\n\nAnd Merchan made clear that it was the office of the presidency \u2013 and not Trump himself \u2013 that tied his hands on a sentence in the hush money case.\n\n\u201cIt is the legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States that are extraordinary, not the occupant of the office,\u201d the judge said.\n\nLast year\u2019s seven-week trial was held without any audio or video recordings allowed, but Merchan agreed to allow an audio recording of Friday\u2019s hearing to be released, allowing the public to hear the proceedings \u2013 and Merchan\u2019s measured tone as he delivered his sentence \u2013 for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe considerable \u2013 indeed, extraordinary \u2013 legal protections afforded by the office of the chief executive is a factor that overrides all others,\u201d Merchan said.\n\nThose protections, the judge said, are \u201ca legal mandate, which, pursuant to the rule of law, this court must respect and follow.\u201d\n\nProsecutors concurred with Merchan\u2019s decision to sentence Trump to an unconditional discharge, but assistant district attorney Josh Steinglass accused Trump of harming the rule of law with his conduct before and after the May jury verdict.\n\nSteinglass noted that the probation officer who interviewed Trump for a probation report ahead of the sentencing wrote that Trump \u201csees himself as above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cFar from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct,\u201d Steinglass added, Trump \u201cencouraged others to reject the jury verdict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis defendant has caused enduring damage to the public perception of the criminal justice system,\u201d Steinglass said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kara Scannell describes what she noticed inside the courtroom during Trump's sentencing 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump enters office as a felon\n\nThe unconditional discharge sentence cements the president-elect\u2019s status as a convicted felon, though Trump now walks freely away from the case without any threat of punishment, fines or probationary supervision.\n\nThe sentence essentially serves as a final judgment in the case procedurally, allowing Trump and his attorneys to move forward with his appeals.\n\nThey argue that last summer\u2019s Supreme Court ruling granting widespread presidential immunity means the case should be thrown out. Although the hush money payments at issue were in 2016, before Trump was president, some of the evidence used against him stemmed from his time in office, particularly discussions with witness Hope Hicks.\n\nSteinglass emphasized that \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict in this case was unanimous and decisive and it must be respected.\u201d\n\nMerchan noted the legal protections of the presidency \u2013 but said there\u2019s a big caveat.\n\n\u201cOne power they do not provide is the power to erase a jury verdict,\u201d Merchan said.\n\n\u2018What ifs\u2019 linger over hearing\n\nHow the American public would have reacted or voted if Trump had been sentenced will always be a speculative question.\n\nTrump was initially scheduled to be sentenced on July 11, but that date was pushed back multiple times after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision granting sweeping presidential immunity.\n\nUltimately, the sentencing was delayed until after the election, which allowed Trump\u2019s victory to wipe away any real threat of legal punishment, both in the hush money case and his federal indictments.\n\nMerchan was not required to impose any prison time \u2013 and legal experts debated whether the low-level felonies Trump was convicted of would have warranted it \u2013 but the felonies came with a maximum four-year prison term, so the judge would have had that option. He also could have imposed lesser penalties like home confinement or community service.\n\nIt may ultimately be lost to history to speculate about what Merchan would have done had Trump been sentenced in July \u2013 or if Friday\u2019s hearing came after Trump was a defeated presidential candidate. Merchan didn\u2019t tip his hand Friday when he spoke to Trump and imposed his sentence.\n\nTrump has been sentenced, but there will be appeals\n\nThough the president-elect won\u2019t be penalized in the hush money case, he\u2019s made it clear he wants the conviction tossed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to appeal anyway, just psychologically, because frankly, it\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a judge that shouldn\u2019t have been on the case,\u201d Trump said from Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night.\n\nWhile he\u2019s in office, Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to exhaust every legal avenue to continue fighting the conviction - a process that will likely take years. Now that Merchan has entered a final judgment at sentencing Trump\u2019s legal team can file a substantive appeal with the state appellate court.\n\nTrump\u2019s top defense attorneys, however, are set to enter his administration. Todd Blanche, who was sitting beside Trump on Friday, has been tapped as deputy attorney general. And Emil Bove, who appeared in the Manhattan courtroom on Trump\u2019s behalf, was picked to be the principle associate attorney general.\n\nIf the lower appeals court upholds the jury\u2019s verdict, Trump then can ask the Court of Appeals, New York\u2019s highest court, to consider his case. If his appeals fail in New York, he can take his case up to the US Supreme Court - a move he\u2019s expected to pursue if all other efforts aren\u2019t successful.\n\nMerchan concluded his role in Trump\u2019s trial Friday with a nod to Trump\u2019s future responsibilities, 10 days away: \u201cSir, I wish you Godspeed as you assume your second term in office.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

            "title": "Andrew Cuomo is setting up a comeback try for NYC mayor",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAt the end of September, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo quietly switched his voter registration address to an apartment on East 54th Street in Manhattan. It marked the first time he\u2019d lived in New York City \u2013 officially \u2013 in decades.\n\nBy December, he was ramping up conversations with local political officials and a select group of influential community leaders, hinting at plans to run for mayor in the June primary.\n\nWhat if, Cuomo mused, Eric Adams \u2013 who currently holds the job but is now facing an April trial date on federal corruption charges \u2013 resigned or opted out of running for reelection?\n\nHe\u2019s been telling donors and other influential political figures that if he gets in, he\u2019s going to win, and they\u2019ve got to get behind him.\n\nElected governor three times before resigning in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations and fierce criticism over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Cuomo is now privately describing his long-rumored and labored-over run for mayor as a near certainty, according to conversations with more than a dozen people in his orbit, with whom he has spoken recently but are not authorized to publicly discuss the deliberations. He is also lining up campaign aides and pollsters, in part with the help of a former top adviser who beat him out the door of the governor\u2019s mansion more than three years ago after deciding she could no longer defend him against the flood of sexual misconduct accusations that ultimately forced him out of office.\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t be the first Cuomo who put together an expected candidacy that never actually took off.\n\nTalk of a Cuomo comeback dates back, quite literally, to the day he resigned three-and-a-half years ago, with supporters and opponents alike either convinced or anxious, or both, that a revival bid was \u201cimminent.\u201d He eyed another run for governor, which would have meant taking on successor Kathy Hochul, the former lieutenant governor he always kept at arm\u2019s length and who, in 2022, emerged as a politically weakened winner of a closer-than-expected gubernatorial election.\n\nThe possibility of trying to oust her in 2026 is, as the February filing period for mayoral candidates approaches, one of the last things holding Cuomo back from jumping into the citywide stew. His ambitions were also fueled, in part, by his success in fending off lawsuits related to his alleged misconduct, which he denied before and after resigning, and a recent inspector general report suggesting then-President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department, in 2020, sought to undermine him in the press.\n\nBut it was not until Adams\u2019 indictment last September that \u2013 as Cuomo himself might say \u2013 a new reality emerged. The mayor\u2019s approval ratings are at historic lows and, barring a stunning about-face by federal prosecutors, he is slated to spend a large chunk of the primary campaign in a Lower Manhattan courtroom, while the sense spreads that street crime is even more out of control than it was when Adams won in 2021, promising he\u2019d fix it.\n\nA Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, chalked up anyone who has walked away from conversations with the former governor thinking that he\u2019s definitely running to \u201ca matter of perception.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain those conversations, Azzopardi said, \u201cA lot of people have come to him saying the city is in crisis and it needs to be fixed, and they think he\u2019s the guy to do it because of his track record.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just hasn\u2019t decided yet. It\u2019s purely personal, it\u2019s whether or not he wants to commit the time and the energy. He was 24-7 as governor. It\u2019s a major commitment. It\u2019s something he and his family are talking about,\u201d Azzopardi added.\n\nHe then texted a lengthy prepared statement touting the former governor\u2019s record on issues that helped New Yorkers and brought money into infrastructure projects and noted Cuomo \u201cwill always be a Queens boy who loves New York, is deeply concerned about its direction, and will always help any way he can.\u201d\n\nThe Adams and Trump factors\n\nA defiant Adams on Thursday in his annual \u201cstate of the city\u201d speech again insisted he has no plans to step down \u2013 then described a city better off for his leadership.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to the noise, don\u2019t listen to the rhetoric,\u201d Adams said. \u201cNew York City, the state of our city is strong.\u201d\n\nBut another Queens native is also shaping the race: President-elect Trump. The two have not spoken, but Cuomo has carefully observed his trajectory. People who have spoken with Cuomo say he thinks voters could be convinced to welcome him back, too \u2014 in the character of a tough guy who can set things right in a city wobbling with unease over public safety, an affordability crisis and post-pandemic trauma.\n\nSome around Cuomo think New Yorkers will also be looking for a tough guy to take on Trump, with aides floating the prospect of mass deportations targeted at Democratic cities.\n\nAdams\u2019 legal team is led by attorney Alex Spiro, who also counts Elon Musk as a client, and is already deep into a public relations campaign against federal prosecutors, whom he claims \u2013 without evidence \u2013 moved against him in retaliation for his criticism of President Joe Biden\u2019s border policy. (More than 200,000 migrants have arrived in the city since early 2022, causing a budget crunch and spiking social tensions.)\n\nAdams has further endangered his political standing with city Democrats by cozying up to Trump. The mayor\u2019s allegations that he\u2019s been targeted by a politicized Biden Justice Department rhyme with Trump\u2019s own complaints about the handful of cases launched against him before he was reelected. Trump has expressed sympathy and support for Adams, who met with the president-elect\u2019s incoming \u201cborder czar\u201d in December to discuss how the city could potentially work with the administration on its mass deportation plan.\n\nFor all the frustrations with migrants among city residents and the notably large shifts toward Trump across the city in November\u2019s election, many New York political insiders believe that particularly in a Democratic primary, voters will want at least a somewhat oppositional force.\n\nAccording to those who have spoken with him and his circle, Cuomo figures that even with large parts of the city shifting toward Trump \u2013 or away from Democrats \u2013 during the 2024 general election, he could win over affluent White liberals who want a pugilist in office to square up with Trump (and try to keep their taxes down) to supplement his base.\n\nHis critics are skeptical.\n\n\u201cThe best person to defeat a corrupt New York mayor can\u2019t be a corrupt New York governor,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic consultant who helped run actress Cynthia Nixon\u2019s 2018 primary challenge to Cuomo, told CNN.\n\nIt is also unclear where Cuomo would break from Trump on the issues most likely to dominate the coming campaign. The president-elect, though still personally unpopular in New York, has pushed for a crackdown on crime and is planning a mass deportation program that many advocates expect will focus on undocumented immigrants in big cities.\n\nAlready, the primary is much more crowded than tends to be the case for an incumbent mayor. But Cuomo is much better known than any of the other candidates in the race, and he\u2019s been milking that in corners where he wants to build support, with appearances at Black churches and reiterating staunch support for Israel. He has millions of dollars in a leftover campaign account that he would be expected to direct into a supportive independent expenditure effort.\n\nEarlier this week, the mayor himself juiced speculation about Cuomo\u2019s plans by taking direct aim at the former governor\u2019s record in a rare \u2013 at least since he was indicted and his administration began to unravel \u2013 wide-ranging interview with Politico.\n\n\u201cPeople who are running \u2013 they\u2019re going to have to take claim for the stuff that they did when they were holding office,\u201d Adams said.\n\nAdams raised the nearly six-year-old decision to reform bail laws, which took root among progressive state lawmakers toward the end of Cuomo\u2019s time in office.\n\nAnd Adams isn\u2019t the only one raring to go. After months of trial balloons and rumors, the candidates who would be Cuomo\u2019s rivals are already dug in, trying to remind voters of other controversies beyond the best-known scandals.\n\n\u201cIf and when Cuomo pops his head back up, (voters) will consider his mishandling of COVID-19, the nursing home scandal, and the congressional investigation into his conduct,\u201d former Comptroller Scott Stringer\u2019s campaign wrote in a memo late last year. \u201cThey also remember how he nearly destroyed the (public transit system), leaving the lifeblood of our city, our subway system, in shambles for hypothetical votes upstate.\u201d\n\nHoping to stand out amid a crowded field and ranked choice voting\n\nA Cuomo mayoral campaign would be naturally divisive. In what will be only the second mayoral election to conducted under ranked-choice voting rules \u2013 a process that even some of the city\u2019s shrewdest operatives confess remains an election day wild card \u2013 that might help him.\n\nHe warred with the former mayor, Bill de Blasio, during the seven years they ran the state and city, respectively, clashing over everything from public transit funding and housing to the fate of a wounded deer and the utility of a midday nap.\n\nAsked about his thoughts on Cuomo\u2019s possibly running for his old job, de Blasio texted CNN, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question\u2026 I haven\u2019t really determined if/how/when to share my thoughts\u2026\u201d\n\nAs he tightened his grip on state government, Cuomo became deeply unpopular with many liberals in New York City, where the progressive Working Families Party lined up as his most bitter opponents \u2013 only to see their coalition split, with major labor unions leaving, over the WFP\u2019s attempts to unseat him.\n\nStill, Cuomo is despised by many on the left, personally and politically, and even by Democrats beyond that who want a new start.\n\n\u201cIf a city has ever been crying out for new leadership, it\u2019s New York at this moment \u2013 and Cuomo is the antithesis of new leadership,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who knows the former governor.\n\nWithout the power of being in office to flex against political enemies, strategists believe he will not be as much of a threat. They think his campaign might flare up early but then collapse, much like businessman and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s did four years ago.\n\nStill, with Adams and nearly all of his inner circle swallowed up in legal troubles and ethical scandals, and the city on edge over a post-Covid rise in crime, the mayoral contest has become more a more appealing proposition.\n\nIn a further wrinkle, Cuomo and Adams \u2013 if they were to both run \u2013 would be competing for many of the same primary voters. Adams\u2019s base largely overlaps with the neighborhoods and constituencies that consistently turned out in force for Cuomo during his three successful gubernatorial campaigns.\n\nConcerns over how that bloc \u2013 comprised of Black working class voters and other ethnic outer-borough cohorts \u2013 would breakdown with both men on the ballot had, sources familiar with Cuomo\u2019s thinking told CNN, been a potential roadblock to his entering the race.\n\nThe conventional wisdom among Democratic strategists, until the last week, had been that Cuomo would not seek to challenge Adams in primary, preferring the mayor step down and, by law, trigger a nonpartisan special election.\n\n\u201cThere were some who said, \u2018step down,\u2019\u201d Adams crowed during his state of the city speech. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I\u2019m gonna step up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of this has left many of the city\u2019s power brokers holding off supporting anyone, at least for now.\n\nIn an interview last fall, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries \u2013 who remains very involved in city politics and eventually backed Adams in 2021 \u2013 told CNN that he believes Adams is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the right to go to trial.\n\nBut Jeffries demurred when asked if he\u2019d be ready to support Adams for reelection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we get to it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline has been updated.",

            "text": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nOver-the-counter protein powders may contain disturbing levels of lead and cadmium, with the highest amounts found in plant-based, organic and chocolate-flavored products, according to a new investigation.\n\nThere is no level of lead that is safe for humans, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Cadmium is a carcinogen which is also toxic to the body\u2019s heart, kidneys, gut, brain, respiratory and reproductive systems, according to the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n\u201cOn average, organic protein powders had three times more lead and twice the amount of cadmium compared to non-organic products,\u201d said Jaclyn Bowen, executive director of the Clean Label Project, a nonprofit dedicated to transparent food labeling that released the new report Thursday.\n\nPlant-based powders, such as those made from soy, rice, peas and other plants, contained three times more lead than whey-based products, according to the report. (Whey is the liquid byproduct of cheesemaking.)\n\nPlants naturally absorb heavy metals from the planet\u2019s crust but can contain elevated levels if grown in soil that has been further contaminated by mining, industrial waste, and some pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nAnother key source of contamination in protein powders was chocolate flavoring, according to the report.\n\n\u201cChocolate-flavored protein powders contained four times more lead and up to 110 times more cadmium than vanilla-flavored powders,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nDespite being rich in flavonoids, antioxidants and other beneficial minerals, dark chocolate, or cacao, has been found to contain high levels of heavy metals. A July 2024 study found 43% of six dozen dark chocolate products exceeded California\u2019s Proposition 65\u2019s maximum allowable dose level for lead of 0.5 parts per million.\n\n\u201cHeavy metal contaminant is a global food safety problem,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThese contaminants are basically everywhere, including in things that are being represented as health foods.\u201d\n\nThe Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry association that represents supplement manufacturers, told CNN via email that the new report did not provide sufficient transparency about the criteria used for contamination thresholds and how products were selected.\n\n\u201cWithout such clarity, consumers and industry stakeholders cannot fully evaluate the validity of the claims,\u201d said Andrea Wong, CRN\u2019s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs.\n\n\u201cModern analytical techniques can detect even trace levels of naturally occurring elements, such as heavy metals, which are present in soil, air, and water,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThese trace levels are often well below established safety thresholds set by federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\u201d\n\nGood news on BPA\n\nFor the new investigation, the Clean Label Project purchased 160 products from 70 of the best-selling brands of protein powders. The brands were not disclosed in the report, however.\n\n\u201cWe do not disclose the names of companies we test in order to maintain fairness and consistency and to avoid potential conflicts of interest,\u201d Bowen said.\n\nProtein powder samples were then sent to an independent certified laboratory, which ran nearly 36,000 individual tests on 258 different contaminants, including heavy metals, bisphenols, phthalates and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.\n\nHowever, only levels of lead, cadmium, bisphenol A and its cousin bisphenol S, more commonly known as BPA and BPS, were included in the 2024 report. Data on other contaminants will be released in a later update, Bowen said.\n\nBisphenols are hormone disruptors that studies have linked to fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, and brain and behavior disorders in infants and children. In adults, the chemicals are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, cancer and a 49% higher risk of early death within 10 years.\n\nBisphenol A was widely used to create baby bottles, sippy cups and infant formula containers until frightened parents boycotted those products more than a decade ago.\n\nA similar investigation of protein powders by Clean Label in 2018 found high levels of bisphenols. The 2024 report, however, had good news, Bowen said.\n\n\u201cWe found BPA and BPS in only three of 160 protein powders, compared to 55% of the products we tested in 2018,\u201d she said.\n\nTo analyze heavy metals, researchers at the Clean Label Project compared lead and cadmium testing results with levels established by California\u2019s Proposition 65.\n\n\u201cProp 65 is arguably the most progressive law in the land when it comes to industrial environmental contaminants,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThey have very clear pass-fail criteria that is typically much stricter than federal agencies in the US.\u201d\n\nOverall, 47% of the 160 protein powder samples tested by the Clean Label Project in 2024 exceeded Prop 65 regulatory guidelines, the report said. About 21% of the powders contained levels twice as high as the Prop 65 limit, Bowen said.\n\nNearly 80% of the plant-based and organic protein powders tested were over the Prop 65 limit for lead. However, only 26% of collagen-based protein products and 28% of the whey-based products exceeded the California lead limit.\n\nWhat consumers can do\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary to stop using protein powders as part of a healthy lifestyle, Bowen said, but it does help to shop smart.\n\n\u201cFor people following a fully plant-based diet, protein powders made from peas appear to have the lowest levels of heavy metals,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any dietary restrictions, the data suggests that whey-based or egg-based, vanilla-flavored protein powders will have the least amount.\u201d\n\nReaching out to favorite brands to inquire about contaminant levels is another smart action by consumers, Bowen added.\n\n\u201cAsk questions, demand answers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe topic of heavy metals isn\u2019t going away.\u201d",

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nDrinking coffee has repeatedly been linked with better heart health and prolonged life. But the benefits of coffee consumption could depend on when you drink it, new research has found.\n\nLimiting coffee intake to the morning, it turns out, may be best \u2014 and that seems to be regardless of the amount consumed and other potentially influential factors, according to a study published Tuesday in the European Heart Journal.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes,\u201d said lead author Dr. Lu Qi, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and professor at Tulane University\u2019s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, in a news release. \u201cWe don\u2019t typically give advice about timing in our dietary guidance, but perhaps we should be thinking about this in the future.\u201d\n\nMost past research investigating participants\u2019 coffee intake over time have found moderate levels of coffee consumption may be associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and premature death, according to the latest study. But scientific evidence of whether factors such as genetics, amount consumed or added sweeteners affect these relationships has been inconsistent or, at times, controversial, the authors said.\n\nThe authors studied the dietary and health data of 40,725 adults age 18 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1999 to 2018. During 10 cycles over the years, those participants provided details of their dietary intake from the previous day. The authors also included a subgroup of 1,463 adults, from both the women\u2019s and men\u2019s versions of the Lifestyle Validation Study, who had completed at least one weeklong dietary record.\n\nBoth caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee were included, and timing was categorized in three periods: morning (from 4 a.m. to 11:59 a.m.), afternoon (from 12 p.m. to 4:59 p.m.) and evening (from 5 p.m. to 3:59 a.m.).\n\nThe researchers identified two patterns of timing of consumption: morning and all day. By the end of the median follow-up period of nearly 10 years, there were 4,295 deaths from all causes, 1,268 from cardiovascular disease and 934 from cancer.\n\nCompared with people who weren\u2019t coffee drinkers, having coffee only in the morning was associated with a 16% lower risk of premature death from any cause and a 31% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Those who tended to drink coffee all day didn\u2019t have a reduction in risk. These findings remained even after the authors took into account confounders such as sleep hours, age, race, ethnicity, sex, family income, education, physical activity levels, a dietary score, and health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.\n\nFor morning coffee drinkers, the amount of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee consumed didn\u2019t matter, either \u2014 whether they drank less than one or more than three cups of coffee daily. Having done so in the morning was still better than other patterns in terms of mortality risk.\n\n\u201cThe study was observational, meaning that it wasn\u2019t an experiment setting, (which) is the gold standard,\u201d said Vanessa King, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, via email.\n\nThe nature of the study also means it only establishes an association, not a causal relationship between morning coffee drinking and early death risk. But the findings are \u201cmeaningful as the leading cause of death in America is cardiovascular diseases,\u201d King added.\n\nWhy timing could matter\n\nDr. David Kao, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, found the study to be \u201cfascinating\u201d and one of the best investigations on this topic in years, he said.\n\n\u201cHighlights include using a machine learning-style method to categorize coffee drinking patterns, and validation of findings in (more than one) external data source which are distinct from the primary source, which greatly reduces the likelihood of an accidental/false positive finding,\u201d Kao, the Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women\u2019s Heart Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz, said via email.\n\nHowever, the study has a few other shortcomings: For one, recollections of dietary intake are subject to inaccuracies or biases, and they don\u2019t account for long-term habits, the authors said.\n\nSecondly, even though the authors considered multiple confounders, it\u2019s possible there were others that couldn\u2019t be completely ruled out, they said \u2014 such as variations in work shifts and times of getting up for the day.\n\nThe team also \u201ccould not exclude the possibility that the morning-type coffee drinking pattern is a marker for an overall healthy lifestyle,\u201d according to the study. \u201cFor example, morning-type coffee drinkers may be more willing to exercise and eat non-ultra-processed foods.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, genetic information wasn\u2019t available, so the authors were unable to examine any possible effect of genetically determined caffeine metabolism rates.\n\nA possible explanation for the findings \u201cis that consuming coffee in the afternoon or evening may disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin,\u201d Qi said. Low levels of melatonin have been linked with higher levels of blood pressure and oxidative stress, and greater cardiovascular disease risk.\n\nCoffee also contains antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body by neutralizing free radicals that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, King said. Free radicals, unstable molecules from environmental sources such as cigarette smoke or pesticides, can harm cells.\n\nSome inflammatory markers in the blood have their own clocks, the authors said, and they are typically highest in the morning \u2014 so \u201cthe anti-inflammatory effect of a pattern of coffee consumption concentrated in the morning may be more beneficial than that of a pattern \u2026 spread across morning, afternoon and evening.\u201d That applies to both caffeinated and decaf coffee consumption.\n\nAdjusting coffee intake\n\nIf you want to start restricting your coffee intake to the morning but are having trouble, consider whether you\u2019re regularly getting enough quality rest, King said. Seeing a sleep specialist to find out whether you have a condition, such as sleep apnea, disturbing your rest could also be useful, Kao said.\n\nYou can also begin with diluting your daytime servings and accompanying them with water for hydration, King said \u2014 which can also help you feel more awake.\n\nREAD MORE: 6 ways to wake up without coffee\n\nGetting your thyroid, vitamin D and iron levels tested can help you determine whether exhaustion is stemming from something more serious, said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nIf you don\u2019t drink coffee and think you could gain from adding it to your routine, first \u201clook at the bigger picture,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAre you living an overall physically active, balanced, sustainable and healthy diet and lifestyle?\u201d\n\nUntil more evidence is provided about when to drink coffee, she added, follow your doctor or dietitian\u2019s recommendation on caffeine intake.",

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nSugary drinks may leave a sour taste given their possible impact on mortality, according to a new study. \u201cThis is a public health crisis, requiring urgent action,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, analyzed global data on sugar-sweetened beverages consumed around the world, observational and randomized studies, and both diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevalence.\n\nWith the evidence, researchers created a comparative risk model and estimated that sugary drinks \u201ccause more than 330,000 annual deaths from diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\u201d Mozaffarian said.\n\nThe problem is particularly serious in Latin America and the Caribbean, which had the largest number of cardiovascular disease cases related to beverages, and sub-Saharan Africa, which also had the most cases of type 2 diabetes from sugary drinks, he added, based on the researchers\u2019 model.\n\nThe study also examined the demographics of those most affected by sweetened drinks \u2013\u2013 namely, younger male adults with higher education in urban areas, said Toby Smithson, a registered dietitian nutritionist, fellow of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and senior manager of nutrition and wellness at the American Diabetes Association. She was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to pay attention to, and take priority actions to deal with, this tragic preventable suffering,\u201d Mozaffarian said in an email.\n\nWhy liquid sugar is so fast-acting\n\nBecause the study did not test a behavior or intervention against a control group, the new study\u2019s researchers can\u2019t say that the sugar sweetened beverages are causing diabetes and cardiovascular disease \u2013\u2013 they can only estimate the impact.\n\nThe researchers collected valuable data across 184 countries, but the study did not factor in all income levels and the increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among high-risk ethnic groups, Smithson said.\n\nBut the finding of sugary beverages as harmful makes sense, as many studies have shown a link between such drinks and poor health impacts, Mozaffarian said.\n\nSugar sweetened beverages have \u201cempty calories\u201d \u2014 or calories without any nutritional benefits, Smithson said. They are also a source of fast-acting carbohydrates, which enter the bloodstream and raise blood sugar quickly, she added.\n\nThese empty sugars in liquid form are even more harmful than those in desserts or sweet foods, Suzanne Janzi, a doctoral student in nutritional epidemiology at Lund University in Sweden, said in an earlier CNN article. She was not part of the most recent research.\n\n\u201cLiquid sugars are absorbed more rapidly in the digestive system since they do not require the same breakdown processes as solid foods,\u201d Janzi said in an email. \u201cSolid sugars are often part of foods that contain other nutrients like fiber, proteins, and fats.\u201d\n\nThose nutrients slow digestion, meaning there is a more gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, she said.\n\nWhile fats, fiber and proteins in solid food leave you feeling fuller longer, liquid sugars often don\u2019t fill you up, which can lead to appetite dysregulation and the consumption of too many calories, she added.\n\n\u201cDifferent sources of added sugars also vary in their consumption patterns, which could further explain why they associate differently with cardiovascular disease risk,\u201d Janzi said.\n\nAre alternative sweeteners the answer?\n\nWhat about drinks that are sweetened with something other than sugar? They might be better, but they aren\u2019t the answer, Mozaffarian said.\n\n\u201cGrowing research shows that both natural and artificial low-calorie sweeteners are not innocuous and may cause health harms, so these should be considered a short-term, less harmful alternative, not a long-term solution,\u201d he said.\n\nFor example, artificial sweeteners might be a good substitute in moderation for people with diabetes, who may be accustomed to sugary drinks, Smithson said.\n\n\u201cBy providing a diabetes-friendly way to prepare foods people are used to eating, we can meet people where they are in offering support to effectively manage their diabetes,\u201d she said.\n\nBut instead of relying on artificial sweeteners, Mozaffarian advises switching to unsweetened drinks all together, such as seltzer, unsweetened tea or coffee, or just plain water.\n\nHydration is important for managing blood pressure, blood sugar, internal temperature and digestion, Smithson said.\n\n\u201cThe best hydrating beverage is water,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIf a person doesn\u2019t like plain water, they can jazz up their beverage by drinking infused water with slices of lemon, lime, or fresh herbs, or using sparkling waters that contain no added sugar.\u201d",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSex just isn\u2019t the same with your partner anymore. When you confide that sad reality to a friend, what\u2019s the first culprit you discuss? Overwork? Young children? Relationship problems, or even the worst-case scenario \u2014 an affair?\n\nYou may want to start by looking at your sleep habits as a couple, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine and director of its Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine in Chicago.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just toss it up to \u2018My partner just isn\u2019t interested,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m too tired to care about sexual desire,\u2019 or \u2018Oh, I\u2019m just getting old, that\u2019s just the way it is,\u2019\u201d Zee said. \u201cLook at yourself, look at your sleep habits and consider those of your partner as well.\u201d\n\nPoor quality sleep is directly linked to inadequate levels of sex hormones, such as testosterone \u2014 and if you think that just applies to men, think again.\n\n\u201cThe sex drive in both men and women is testosterone-related \u2014 testosterone increases libido,\u201d Zee said. \u201cTestosterone begins to rise about 3 or 4 o\u2019clock and peaks in the morning. And studies have shown that if you have disrupted sleep, those levels fall.\u201d\n\nWomen over 50 who slept fewer than seven to eight hours per night were less likely to report being sexually active than younger women, according to a 2017 Menopause Society study. It\u2019s a problem that worsens with age as sleep becomes more precious. In fact, women older than 70 who slept fewer than five hours a night were 30% less likely to be sexually active than women sleeping seven to eight hours, that study found.\n\nA 2021 analysis of studies found men who were sleep-deprived had lower testosterone levels, while another study found men with disturbed sleep had both lower testosterone levels and higher amounts of cortisol, the stress hormone.\n\nWhen sleep becomes a priority, however, sex lives can improve. A 2015 study of sleep and sex in college students found each additional hour of sleep was correlated to an improved libido, greater vaginal lubrication and a 14% increase in having sex the next day.\n\n\u201cI think it is legitimate to say that one is too tired for sex,\u201d said Ian Kerner, a licensed couples therapist in New York City who is a writer and CNN contributor on sex and relationships.\n\nBut how we think of sex might require a change in perspective.\n\n\u201cWe also have to look at sex as less of a light switch that you turn on and off, and more as a dimmer that you really need to let simmer and then turn up to percolate sexual desire,\u201d Kerner said. \u201cIt requires an attitudinal shift. I think you have to show up prepared to simmer, then percolate and let desire emerge, as opposed to it just happening.\u201d\n\nWant more from your sex life? Get prepared to spice it up this year with a new perspective on sleep.\n\nWork on your sleep hygiene\n\nWe keep our bodies clean, washing skin and hair and brushing and flossing teeth. If we just rolled into and out of bed without doing any of those things at night and in the morning, we\u2019d soon be a mess. The same applies to sleep, experts say.\n\nJust as you choose your clothes or style your hair, you need to prepare your body and bedroom for good sleep. Keep the bedroom cool and dark without blue light distractions such as televisions and smartphones. Avoid eating or drinking about three hours before retiring \u2014 especially alcohol, which will wake you in the middle of the night once it metabolizes. Try soothing music, yoga or meditation or consider a warm bath or shower to relax.\n\nAnd most importantly, Zee said, plan to disengage your mind.\n\n\u201cStop the work and prepare for relaxation,\u201d Zee said. \u201cStop being engaged mentally about an hour before you go to bed so that you can be more relaxed and ready for sleep.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re also more likely to be relaxed enough for sex, which brings its own sleep benefits.\n\n\u201cSex is actually good for sleep,\u201d Kerner said. \u201cSex itself is a process of getting into a flow state, getting into our bodies and turning off our anxious minds. Orgasms release hormones and neurotransmitters that promote sleep, so good sex nurtures sleep.\u201d\n\nGet tested for a sleep disorder\n\nSleep disorders can also interfere with sex, and millions of Americans have one or more, often undiagnosed. Obstructive sleep apnea \u2014 a potentially dangerous condition in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time multiple times an hour \u2014 has been linked to erectile dysfunction in men and sexual disorders in women.\n\nWhile snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea, so are night sweats, tooth grinding and morning headaches. All these can be warning signs that you should visit a sleep specialist.\n\nInsomnia, in which people wake during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep, is another sign of sleep apnea \u2014 as well as a sleep disorder on its own \u2014 and is linked to sexual issues in both men and women.\n\nPoor sleep also increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular problems in both sexes, limiting blood flow that may affect sexual function as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s your sleep chronotype?\n\nCircadian rhythm sleep disorders, which present as an inability to sleep at the desired time to function optimally at work and school, can also wreak havoc with one\u2019s sex life. Shift workers, who split their days and nights or work entirely overnight, often experience chronic sexual dysfunction \u2014 and that applies to both men and women.\n\nMismatched sleep chronotypes \u2014 such as one partner who is a night owl and stays up late while the other is an early bird who\u2019s in bed by 9 p.m. \u2014 can negatively affect a couple\u2019s sex life. Studies show that couples who go to bed and get up together report greater sexual satisfaction and better sleep quality.\n\n\u201cBe mindful of your partner\u2019s chronotype,\u201d Zee said, \u201cand if you aren\u2019t certain, there are chronotype questionnaires online that you both can take.\u201d\n\nWhile your sleep chronotype is genetically programmed, there are ways you can adjust to match your partner\u2019s preference. A night owl, for example, can turn off lights earlier to trigger the release of melatonin, nature\u2019s sleep hormone, and flood their eyes with early morning light to turn it off.\n\n\u201cThe strongest reset for the circadian system is bright light,\u201d Zee told CNN in an earlier interview. \u201cLight in the morning changes the oscillation of your circadian clock genes at both a cellular and molecular level. You are also training all your rhythms, whether it\u2019s sleep, blood pressure, heart rate or your cortisol rhythm to be earlier.\u201d\n\nEating evening meals at an earlier time also sends a message to the body to adjust its internal rhythm, as does moving one\u2019s exercise routine to the morning or early afternoon.\n\n\u201cI think exercise is really good for both sleep and sex,\u201d Zee said. \u201cIt boosts muscle, limbers joints and can increase your libido.\u201d\n\nGood sleep and good sex take practice\n\nAll too often people expect to fall asleep when their head hits the pillow \u2014 or have their libido work at will \u2014 but that\u2019s a pipe dream, Kerner said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to develop bad sleep habits that can affect the quality of your sleep, and the same is true for sex,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think sex is spontaneous, sex is organic, sexual chemistry and sexual fireworks should just happen,\u201d Kerner said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s absolutely not true in long-term relationships. Good sex, just like good sleep, needs to be planned.\u201d\n\nKerner often gives couples he works with homework assignments that he calls \u201cwillingness windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask them to carve out a window of time to be willing to be sexual with each other. It doesn\u2019t have to result in sex. It can just be 15 minutes of kissing or fooling around, just trying to warm up and see where things go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny sexual contact reminds you and your partner that sex is part of your life, and it\u2019s important. Any shared arousal, any flirtation, is a positive move toward future sexual events.\u201d\n\nDo you want to learn more about sleep?

She\u2019s since built a brand around her profile, @TheKoreanVegan, publishing a cookbook with the same name and racking up more than 3 million followers across TikTok and Instagram.\n\nMolinaro is just one of many TikTok influencers who are now bracing for a possible ban of the app in the United States \u2014 and the loss of her six-figure income that could come with it.\n\nA US law that could ban TikTok is set to go into effect on January 19, unless the app is sold or the law is blocked by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court is heard oral arguments on TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the law, which the company claims violates its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users. The US government has argued that the app poses a risk to national security because its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China.\n\n\u201cTikTok collects vast swaths of data about tens of millions of Americans, which the (People\u2019s Republic of China) could use for espionage or blackmail,\u201d the US Justice Department stated in a legal filing to the Supreme Court. \u201cAnd the PRC could covertly manipulate the platform to advance its geopolitical interests and harm the United States.\u201d\n\nThe court appeared likely to uphold the law and allow the ban to go into effect, with both liberal and conservative justices directing a series of tough and skeptical questions at lawyers for TikTok and the app\u2019s users. Several key justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, worried about the potential national security concerns that two presidents have raised about the platform. Historically, the court has deferred to the other branches of government on matters of national security.\n\n\u201cAre we supposed to ignore the fact that (TikTok\u2019s) ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\u201d Roberts said.\n\nAnd during more than two hours of arguments, many of the justices appeared to view the sell-or-ban law not primarily as one with First Amendment implications, but rather an effort to regulate foreign control of popular app.\n\nBut TikTok lawyer, Noel Francisco, repeatedly argued that the law violates its free speech rights, and that separating TikTok\u2019s US presence from ByteDance is an unreasonable solution.\n\n\u201cAny new TikTok would be a fundamentally different platform with different content, which is yet another reason why I think this is a content-based restriction that falls directly on TikTok,\u201d Francisco said.\n\nFinancial impact of a ban\n\nMany TikTok users aren\u2019t concerned by the Chinese government, at least if the revenue they generate is any indication.\n\nBy TikTok\u2019s own estimate, the 7 million US small businesses that use the app stand to lose $1 billion in revenue, and around 2 million creators would suffer $300 million in lost earnings in just one month, if the app is banned.\n\n\u201cA TikTok ban would be absolutely catastrophic for the creators and the small businesses who rely on it,\u201d said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media and internet culture. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my career talking to creators and influencers, they are resilient, they\u2019ll pivot, but it will be a struggle in the meantime and take a hit to them financially.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s popularity skyrocketed in 2020 thanks in large part to its unique algorithm, which prioritizes showing users entertaining content whether or not it\u2019s from an account they follow. It was unlike older mainstay platforms\u2019 feeds, which had largely been based on reinforcing existing social connections. Users flocked to the app, as did creators, who found it far easier to quickly build an audience and discover almost overnight success if they correctly predicted what the algorithm would want.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Eli Rallo, who downloaded the app in 2020 as a senior in college, stuck at home because of Covid-19.\n\n(L-R): Joanne Molinaro, Eli Rallo. The two creators are working to grow other income streams ahead of a possible TikTok ban. JP Yim/John Nacion/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI was messing around with my brothers one night\u2026 in our kitchen. And I made a video of us filling up a jar of snacks with trail mix and I put music behind it. It was kind of random, very Gen Z humor-esque,\u201d Rallo told CNN. \u201cAnd the next day it had, like, 200,000 views. I was shocked. And then I just started to make videos from there.\u201d\n\nSocial media has been Rallo\u2019s full-time job since October 2021; she now has more than 1 million followers across TikTok and Instagram and is in the process of writing her second book.\n\n\u201cMy career just simply would not be where it is today without TikTok,\u201d she said.\n\nRallo says she now regularly inks five-figure deals with brands to promote their products on TikTok. She\u2019s part of the \u201ccreator economy\u201d that Goldman Sachs has estimated could be worth $480 billion by 2027.\n\nBut she\u2019s worried that could change if the app is banned.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned, if I\u2019m being honest, about what would happen because I do think my financial situation would change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky that I make money from my books, and I\u2019m very lucky that I make money from brands on Instagram. I think we would see an uptick in deals on Instagram, but the TikTok money is definitely the bulk of my income.\u201d\n\nMolinaro said she\u2019s already seeing the financial impact of a potential ban, starting back in April when President Joe Biden signed the sale-or-ban law. In 2024, Molinaro estimates she took in 30% less money from sponsors.\n\n\u201cThose brands are not willing to spend dollars right now because they\u2019re terrified. \u2018Oh, why would I spend money on a campaign that\u2019s going to just fall flat on its face in a few days?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat has directly impacted me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s impacted a lot of influencers.\u201d\n\nOpportunity on other platforms\n\nA TikTok ban could boost competitors like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut for people who make earn their income on TikTok, it may be difficult to shift to depending entirely on those other platforms.\n\nIt can take time to build up a following on other apps large enough to draw big sponsorships, as their TikTok followers may or may not follow them. And other platforms\u2019 algorithms often prioritize different things \u2014 maybe longer videos or certain kinds of music \u2014 and it can take time for people to adjust their strategies.\n\nTikTok supporters hold signs at a news conference expressing concerns about the sale-or-ban legislation, outside of the US Capitol Building on March 12, 2024 in Washington, DC Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same technology. It\u2019s not the same type of user. It\u2019s not the same culture,\u201d Maddox said.\n\nAnd a ban could have ripple effects beyond individuals on TikTok. Many influencers employ teams to support their careers, such as agents, accountants and lawyers to review brand deals.\n\n\u201cMany people think, oh, a TikTok ban is going to mean these glamorous, frivolous influencers are going to have to get real jobs,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s the top 1% that is making a lot of money and living a very glamorous lifestyle. But the reality is the people who are going to be most hurt by a TikTok ban are those staunchly middle-class Americans who are using this for information, for entertainment, to grow their business, their following, and grow their community.\u201d\n\nFor now, Rallo and Molinaro say they\u2019re working to diversify their businesses and grow their followings elsewhere, including other social platforms or email newsletters.\n\n\u201cSocial media, somebody once described it to me, it\u2019s like building real estate on sand. You never know,\u201d Molinaro said.\n\n\u2013CNN\u2019s John Fritze contributed to this report.",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA group formed by billionaire entrepreneur and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt has made a formal offer to buy TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance.\n\nThe group, which calls itself The People\u2019s Bid for TikTok and is also backed by \u201cShark Tank\u201d-famous investor Kevin O\u2019Leary, said Thursday it had delivered a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok\u2019s US assets. It did not disclose the value of the offer.\n\nThe bid comes just one day before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments over whether to uphold a law that would ban TikTok in the United States starting January 19 if it is not sold, following a legal challenge from the social media company.\n\nBut the proposal could face a major problem: ByteDance has repeatedly said TikTok\u2019s not for sale.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden signed the law that could ban the app in April, ByteDance swatted down speculation that it was exploring a sale and said that it had no plans to sell TikTok. In a filing to the Supreme Court \u2014 which argues that the law would violate the first amendment rights of the platform and its users \u2014 the company said the law \u201cwill take effect on January 19, 2025, shutting down TikTok for its more than 170 million monthly American users.\u201d\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the McCourt group\u2019s bid. TikTok is the first Chinese social media app to become a global success that competes with American tech giants.\n\nThe People\u2019s Bid is backed by investment firm Guggenheim Securities, as well as technologists and academics, including world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. And McCourt said the group plans to work with President-elect Donald Trump to close the deal.\n\nThe group\u2019s plan is to buy the US version of TikTok without its famous algorithm and rebuild it on American-designed technology, a likely response to a Chinese export control rule requiring a license to sell sensitive technologies. China\u2019s commerce ministry previously said it would \u201cfirmly oppose\u201d a forced sale of TikTok.\n\nTikTok's parent company ByteDance has repeatedly said it has no interest in selling the American version of the app. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat effort would \u201cminimize interruption for TikTokers and prioritize privacy and trust on the platform,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy keeping the platform alive without relying on the current TikTok algorithm and avoiding a ban, millions of Americans can continue to enjoy the platform,\u201d McCourt, who formed the group through his organization dedicated to improving the internet, Project Liberty, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe look forward to working with ByteDance, President-elect Trump, and the incoming administration to get this deal done.\u201d\n\nBut many users and social media experts have questioned whether a sale that excludes the algorithm could be successful, given that the technology that decides what users see on their \u201cFor You\u201d feeds is a major reason for the app\u2019s popularity. Other tech giants have struggled to replicate it.\n\n\u201cWe want to eliminate the misconception that it can\u2019t sell because no one will buy it without the algorithm. NOT true,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in an X post Wednesday, after announcing he was joining the bid to buy the app earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019ll buy it without the algorithm. We don\u2019t need them. We\u2019ll do it ourselves and make TikTok wonderful again.\u201d",

            "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nOpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman denied allegations made by his sister in a lawsuit filed Monday, which claimed he sexually abused her for almost a decade.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Missouri, accuses him of sexual assault and sexual battery spanning from 1997 to 2006.\n\nHis sister, Ann Altman, alleged the sexual abuse began when she was three years old and her brother was 12 at their family home in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, according to the suit.\n\nThe abuse included \u201cnumerous acts of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, molestation, sodomy, and battery,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe also alleged the last instances of abuse occurred when she was a minor and her brother was an adult.\n\nCNN has reached out to representation for Sam Altman but has not heard back.\n\nAltman, in a joint statement with his mother and brothers, said the claims were false and that his sister had struggled with mental health issues and \u201crefuses conventional treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue. The situation causes immense pain to our entire family,\u201d the statement, posted on X Tuesday, said.\n\nSam Altman said \u201cAnnie\u201d continued to demand money from the family despite financial support.\n\n\u201cOur family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnnie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life. Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Altman family statement, Ann Altman\u2019s lawyer Ryan Mahoney said that \u201cIt is not uncommon for parents and other family members to deny (sexual abuse perpetrated by a sibling). In this case, they are focusing on the wrong sibling.\u201d\n\nMahoney told the Wall Street Journal \u201cthere is no evidence that her own mental health has contributed to her allegations.\u201d\n\nAnn Altman, who was 30 when the lawsuit was filed, claimed she has experienced PTSD and extreme emotional distress, mental anguish and depression and has incurred medical bills as a result, according to the lawsuit. She is seeking at least $75,000 in damages.\n\nAnn Altman had previously alleged abuse on her X account beginning in 2021.\n\nThe lawsuit says the claims were brought under a Missouri law allowing child sexual abuse victims to file lawsuits up until their 31st birthday. Ann Altman\u2019s X profile indicates she turned 31 on Wednesday, two days after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nSam Altman is AI\u2019s biggest star \u2014 a 39-year-old venture capitalist and the CEO of OpenAI, which kicked off the artificial intelligence wave with its ChatGPT bot. The Microsoft-backed OpenAI had a $157 billion valuation as of October.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

Rolex\u2019s Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\n\nWith its silky orange mane and wide-eyed glare, the golden lion tamarin might not seem out of place as a character in a Dr Seuss book.\n\nLion tamarins, small monkeys found in eastern Brazil, were described as \"beautiful, simian-like cats similar to small lions,\" by Antonio Pigafetta, one of the explorers on the first voyage to successfully circumnavigate the Earth in 1519.\n\nHalf a millennium later, the golden lion tamarin has become something of a local celebrity \u2013 featuring on a Brazilian postage stamp and the country\u2019s 20 real banknote.\n\nYet despite its popularity, the species is under threat. Its native habitat, the Atlantic rainforest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, has been reduced to just over 7% of its original size. Of that, 80% is highly fragmented, and most patches are too small to support healthy golden lion tamarin populations. Alongside capture for the pet trade, this drove the species to the brink of extinction; by the 1970s as few as 200 individuals remained in the wild.\n\nHowever, through coordinated reintroduction programs, vaccination schemes and initiatives to reconnect fragmented habitats, the golden lion tamarin has made an impressive comeback. The IUCN changed its status from critically endangered to endangered in 2003, and the most recent census estimated 4,800 wild individuals.",

            "title": "Watershed moment for the Middle East after Lebanon elects new president - with a Saudi push",
            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIt was a last-minute push by Saudi Arabia that decided Lebanon\u2019s fate on Thursday.\n\nThere were less than 24 hours before parliament was set to choose the next president. But Lebanon\u2019s checkered political landscape was in total disarray.\n\nThe sectarian political elite seemed to be stuck at the drawing board. Presidents in Lebanon are brought to power by near political consensus, but more than six contenders were still in play. Debates were heated and army chief Joseph Aoun was dismissed by many politicians as constitutionally unqualified for the presidency because of his military post.\n\nIt looked like parliament was heading for its 13th failed attempt to elect a president in more than two years.\n\nThen, a Saudi delegation headed by the kingdom\u2019s envoy, Prince Yazid bin Farhan, flew into Beirut for the second time in a week. It held a blitz of meetings with various political parties. By the time they left, there was only one candidate left: the US-backed Aoun.\n\nNinety-nine lawmakers voted for Aoun, surpassing the requisite two-thirds of Parliament. The remaining 29 ballots were largely either blank or disqualified (one of the lawmakers cast his vote for \u201cBernie Sanders\u201d).\n\nWithin minutes, Aoun arrived in parliament, having swapped his army fatigues for a suit and tie. He took an oath and gave an Earth-shattering, seemingly well-rehearsed speech, vowing to usher in Lebanon\u2019s \u201cnew era\u201d and monopolize weapons under the aegis of the state. In other words, Hezbollah, one of the world\u2019s best armed militant groups for the better part of the last 40 years, was set to be disarmed.\n\nJubilation filled the streets. A presidential vacuum had been filled. A years-long stalemate between the confessional elite had broken - for the time-being at least.\n\nBut it was a development that raised larger questions. Why had Saudi Arabia expended so much diplomatic capital to deliver a president, ending nearly eight years of disengagement from Lebanon that it dismissed as \u201clost\u201d to Iranian domination via Hezbollah?\n\nAnother factor that unlocked the Aoun presidency is also significant: Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal party voted for him.\n\nLebanon's army chief Joseph Aoun inspects troops in Beirut after being elected president. Mohamed Azakir/Reuters\n\nIt was a highly choreographed affair. Hezbollah and Amal, known as the Shia duo, cast blank votes in the first round of voting, which failed to produce a president. During a two-hour recess, the heads of their respective parliamentary blocs held a meeting with Aoun, the details of which are unknown. After returning to parliament, they cast their ballots for Aoun, breaking the deadlock and opening the path to the presidency.\n\nThe message was clear. Hezbollah may have been severely weakened by its war with Israel in the fall, and by the recent toppling of its key ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but it could still prolong a stalemate, or end it.\n\nWhy, however, had they voted for a president with a mandate to disarm them?\n\nSaudi Arabia re-enters the fray\n\nIt is unclear what happened during the meetings where Saudi Arabia corralled overwhelming support for Aoun. But it was a full-throated effort that happened in tandem with Western diplomatic talks. France\u2019s special envoy to Lebanon Jean-Yves Le Drian had also met with Hezbollah lawmakers.\n\nFrance is one of the few Western countries that does not have a wholesale terror designation on Hezbollah, maintaining a diplomatic channel with the militant group\u2019s political arm. It\u2019s one of the only remaining links between the West and the Iran-backed group.\n\nEarlier this week, US Special Envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein was also doing his part to prop up Aoun\u2019s chances with a flurry of meetings.\n\nNone of this was lost on Lebanon\u2019s lawmakers. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to elect a president,\u201d independent MP Jamil el-Sayyed told local TV station Al-Jadeed from parliament on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re here to certify the appointment of a president.\u201d\n\nIn comments before the casting of ballots, anti-establishment lawmaker Halime El Kaakour gestured to the upper gallery where foreign dignitaries \u2013 including the American, French, Egyptian and Iranian ambassadors \u2013 sat. \u201cNo one should impose their will on us, not the tutelage of the Iranians, nor the Syrians, nor the Americans. We shouldn\u2019t replace one (external) guardianship with another,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo one should interfere with our internal affairs, with all my respect to the ambassadors here,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe support international cooperation\u2026 but no one should interfere with our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nAoun\u2019s predecessor is the Hezbollah-backed former President Michel Aoun (the two are not related). His tenure, which ended more than two years ago, was widely seen as an era of Iranian domination in Lebanon, which saw an unprecedented surge in Hezbollah\u2019s political power. That shift in external backing between the two President Aouns is a seismic change for the country.\n\nYet Hezbollah appears to be meeting this moment with a quiet and mysterious resignation. In his remarks to reporters after Aoun\u2019s election, Hezbollah\u2019s parliamentary bloc leader Mohammad Raad said they voted for him to promote \u201cnational understanding.\u201d\n\nThey withheld their vote in the first round, he added ambiguously, because they \u201cwanted to send a message\u2026 that we are protectors of sovereignty.\u201d\n\nStrategic ambiguity may be the best card it holds at this pivotal moment. The militant group received a rapid succession of body blows during the two-month war with Israel in the fall, including with the killing of its long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. The ousting of Assad, who had opened his territory to the group\u2019s supply lines with Iran, severely limited its ability to rearm.\n\nThe group has also agreed to withdraw its fighters from southern Lebanon, its powerbase for four decades and its primary battlefield with Israel, which occupied the area from 1978 to 2000, and which continues to be considered an enemy state by Lebanon.\n\nYet the disarmament is far from complete. Hezbollah is still believed to possess medium- and long-range missiles, and it continues to command a broad Shia support base. This means that there\u2019s likely to be longer negotiations over their arms, undoubtedly roping in external forces.\n\nThis will also be a test of the nearly two-year -long rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran. Domestically, Lebanon\u2019s newly minted president must oversee this process while preventing the outbreak of civil strife, something he hinted at in his acceptance speech when he promised to stop the country\u2019s factions from trying \u201cto break each other\u2019s heads.\u201d\n\nA woman looks for her belongings in the debris of a destroyed building in the city of Tyre, after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed group Hezbollah took effect in late November 2024. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY Adnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli forces still operate in some parts of south Lebanon. The government in Israel has threatened to keep the military there beyond the deadline at the end of this month as stipulated by the US-brokered ceasefire agreement that ended the war in late November.\n\nAoun has promised to force their withdrawal, a responsibility he said would fall to the state alone.\n\nThese are uncharted waters for the tiny and troubled eastern Mediterranean country. But for many here, there\u2019s reason for optimism.\n\n\u201cLebanon finally has a president who brings to the Lebanese people and international community both humane leadership and statehood legitimacy,\u201d said Lynn Zovighian, a columnist, philanthropist and founder at social investment platform Zovighian Partnership.\n\n\u201cIt is time for leadership, constitutional order, a strengthened state, and humanization so that we can finally achieve socio-economic prosperity, justice, and accountability,\u201d Zovighian told CNN.",

Now he\u2019s explaining why he did.\n\nOn Friday\u2019s episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast with brothers Travis and Jason Kelce, Ferrell discussed his thinking behind his decision to dress up as Buddy \u2013 the usually chipper elf from his now-classic 2003 holiday film \u201cElf\u201d \u2013 at an LA Kings hockey game at Los Angeles\u2019 Crypto.com Arena on December 29.\n\n\u201cI get these weird ideas every now and then,\u201d he told the Kelce brothers, later adding, \u201cI told my wife, \u2018Over the break, it would be funny if I just got a Buddy the Elf costume and didn\u2019t shave for like a week, and I\u2019m just sitting there with a candy cigarette and I\u2019m just gonna sit there for a period and see how people react.\u2019 And that was it.\u201d\n\nFerrell clearly committed to the stunt, as pictures from the game display him scowling and sporting a five o\u2019clock shadow, drinking a beer and \u2018smoking\u2019 a faux cigarette.\n\n\u201cBuddy the Elf got laid off, I think, from the North Pole,\u201d Ferrell said on the podcast this week of his motivation for Buddy\u2019s downtrodden vibe, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s having a pull from his beer, smoking a cig.\u201d\n\n\u201cElf\u201d was directed by Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d maestro Jon Favreau and starred Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen and Peter Dinklage, along with the late James Cann, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart.\n\nThe film became an instant holiday classic, and follows Buddy, who was raised among Santa\u2019s elves in the North Pole, as he searches for his real father in New York City.\n\nThe funnyman wasn\u2019t expecting the reaction he got from his \u201cElf\u201d-related lark.\n\n\u201cThe reaction was insane!\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cLike, \u2018What is he doing? Is he promoting something?\u2019 But occasionally I just like to do weird things like that just to stir it up.\u201d\n\nKeep stirring, Buddy.\n\nCNN\u2019s Alli Rosenbloom contributed to this report.",

            "title": "Sam Moore, half of soul duo Sam & Dave, dead at 89",
            "text": "AP \u2014\n\nSam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.\n\nPublicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.\n\nMoore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Sam & Dave partner Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nAt the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d\n\nMost of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d\n\nLike many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.\n\nDave Prater, left, and Sam Moore of the band Sam & Dave performs on stage at the Park West in Chicago, on August 28, 1980. Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nIn 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.\n\nHe also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.\n\nMoore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.\n\nMoore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities.\n\nEight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMoore was born October 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.\n\nHe and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.\n\nMoore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.\n\nHe married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction that he credited with saving his life.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\u201d during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d\n\nMoore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.\n\nMoore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter and two grandchildren.",

            "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nFour years ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg banned Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram, saying the risks of allowing him on the platforms were \u201csimply too great\u201d after Trump repeatedly used the sites to broadcast election lies and cheer on the January 6 mob.\n\nA lot\u2019s changed.\n\nNow, Zuckerberg is making it crystal clear that Meta and MAGA can get along.\n\nThe social media giant is canning its fact-checkers and making its platforms look a little more like X, the site owned by \u201cfirst buddy\u201d Elon Musk. At the same time, Meta named Trump ally and UFC boss Dana White to its board of directors on Monday, days after elevating Joel Kaplan, the most prominent Republican lobbyist for the company, to be its new head of global affairs. Meta was one of several large tech companies to donate $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. And Zuckerberg \u2014 whom Trump once threatened with life in prison \u2014 has personally made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to dine with the incoming president since the election.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg is clearly trying to insulate Meta from Trump\u2019s looming corporate retribution tour, he\u2019s also courting a potential disaster if Meta\u2019s advertisers flee and users begin to associate the brand \u2014 already tarnished by AI slop and a yearslong dearth of innovation \u2014 with the kinds of unsavory characters who now dominate X.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Zuckerberg tapped the president-elect\u2019s favorite TV channel, Fox News, to announce that the world\u2019s dominant social media platforms are now, for all intents and purposes, pro-Trump.\n\nMeta is getting rid of its third-party fact-checkers, Zuckerberg said, because they have been \u201ctoo politically biased,\u201d made too many mistakes \u201cand have destroyed more trust than they\u2019ve created\u201d \u2014 unfalsifiable statements that echo the right\u2019s longtime claim that Facebook censors conservative views. Meta will replace fact-checkers with \u201ccommunity notes\u201d similar to those on X, in which users can add comments to posts that may contain false information.\n\nIn another questionable decision announced Tuesday, Zuckerberg added that Meta will move its content moderation team to Texas from California, saying this would \u201cremove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.\u201d (Meta didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question about why a team located in Texas would be less biased than one in California.)\n\nThe hits kept coming on Tuesday, as my colleague Clare Duffy reported that Meta quietly updated its guidelines to free users who want to refer to gay and transgender people as having a \u201cmental illness,\u201d or refer to women as \u201chousehold objects\u201d and \u201cproperty.\u201d\n\nAll of this buys Meta some insurance going into an era of Trump 2.0. As business leaders remember all too well from Round One, Trump has shown little restraint when he senses companies are being insufficiently loyal. Meta\u2019s own stock tumbled in March after Trump called in to CNBC to label Facebook an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nIf Meta were to take the harder line it invoked four years ago, it could expect to find itself in Trump\u2019s crosshairs on social media and shut out of the rooms where rivals like Musk are making decisions about tech\u2019s future.\n\nBut Meta\u2019s repositioning is hardly a foolproof business plan. Just take a look at X, the site Musk acquired in 2022 when it was called Twitter. Musk remade the site in his own image, reinstating White nationalists and other offensive accounts that had been banned under Twitter\u2019s safety guidelines. Advertisers, wary of their products appearing alongside hate speech, rushed to the exits. Millions of users, similarly unhappy about the return of neo-Nazis on the platform, also left for competitors like Bluesky and Meta\u2019s Threads.\n\nDana White and Mark Zuckerberg attended a UFC match in Las Vegas last year. Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nX\u2019s value has cratered 80% since Musk bought it, according to estimates from investment giant Fidelity.\n\nThat\u2019s not a huge problem for X and Musk, who could theoretically bankroll the entire operation himself.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for Meta, one of the world\u2019s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $1.5 trillion.\n\n\u201cBrand safety remains a key factor in determining where advertisers spend their budgets,\u201d Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said in an email Tuesday. \u201cSocial media is already a minefield for content that many brands deem unsafe, and Meta\u2019s change could exacerbate those problems.\u201d\n\nEven a slight dropoff in engagement could hurt the business, Enberg said.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it before.\n\nIn 2022, Meta lost nearly $240 billion in market value in a single day \u2014 the biggest one-day drop in company value in the history of the US stock market at the time \u2014 after it reported a slight decline in daily active Facebook users and an 8% drop in quarterly profit.\n\nThat hits Zuckerberg where he lives, because he\u2019s the biggest individual shareholder, says Cory Doctorow, a journalist, author and activist with the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. But more importantly, stock swings hit the rich-but-not-billionaire-rich class of Meta executives.\n\n\u201cZuckerberg is insulated from the consequences of making bad choices until he\u2019s not \u2014 until things reach a breaking point\u2026 and then he tends to panic,\u201d Doctorow told me. \u201cTech calls these panics \u2018pivots,\u2019 but they\u2019re just the outcome of being the CEO of a company that posts anemic growth or even a contraction and sees the Street just go nuts on you.\u201d\n\nPast \u201cpivots\u201d have included the Metaverse, the sci-fi nonsense that Zuckerberg pitched as the future of the company three years ago. More recently, Meta is testing out its own AI-generated \u201cusers\u201d in an apparent ploy to goose engagement.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re now at the end of a long run of extremely bad choices,\u201d Doctorow said. Which is not to say Meta is doomed, per se. \u201cBut I think that they are on the path to becoming a kind of zombie \u2014 like MySpace is today. MySpace still exists. It\u2019s just AI-generated slop and spam.\u201d",

Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA tech rivalry between Washington and Beijing has been escalating ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump later this month. Last week, Beijing said it was planning to curb the export of technology used to extract minerals critical for the growth of the global electric vehicle (EV) industry.\n\nIn December, the outgoing Biden administration imposed fresh export controls on US-made semiconductors that Washington fears Beijing could use to make the next generation of weapons and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.\n\nThe US Commerce Department said the goal of the curbs was to slow China\u2019s development of advanced AI tools that can be used in war and to undercut the country\u2019s homegrown semiconductor industry, which it says threatens the national security of the US and its allies.\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nSince coming to power in late 2012, China\u2019s top leader Xi Jinping has unleashed sweeping reforms to transform the Chinese military into a world-class fighting force. A key part of that modernization drive has been to better integrate the country\u2019s private sector and defense industrial base through the sharing of resources, talent and cutting-edge technologies.\n\nWhile efforts to break down barriers between China\u2019s military and civil sectors date back to the 1990s, the military-civil fusion strategy has been increasingly promoted under Xi and elevated to a national strategy in 2014, as part of the leader\u2019s vision to turn China into an economic, technological and military superpower.\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is radically different from the US military, because it is the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said Isaac Stone Fish, CEO and founder of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm with a focus on China.\n\n\u201cBeijing demands that its companies support the PLA,\u201d he said. \u201cUS companies that have important partnerships with large Chinese companies, like Ford with CATL, need to understand that the regulatory, economic, and PR risks of these partnerships will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nIvan Su, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said that given Tencent\u2019s business model, which focuses on social media and gaming, it \u201chas a good chance to secure exclusion through US courts,\u201d like Chinese consumer electronics maker Xiaomi managed to do in 2021 in a separate case.\n\nIn January 2021, during the waning days of the first Trump administration, the Defense Department added Xiaomi to another list, under Section 1237, which subjected it to harsh restrictions, including a ban on American investment.\n\nBefore the ban could take effect, a federal judge granted a temporary reprieve to the Chinese company by ruling that Washington lacked \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support its claim that Xiaomi is owned or controlled by China\u2019s military. In May of that year, the US Department of Defense and Xiaomi reached an agreement to set aside the ban.",

            "text": "Hong Kong CNN \u2014\n\nBeijing is planning to curb the export of technology used to extract minerals critical for the growth of the global electric vehicle (EV) industry, as a tech rivalry with Washington escalates ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump later this month.\n\nChina also wants to add battery cathode technology to its list of controlled exports, according to a notice published Thursday by the Commerce Ministry soliciting public comment, on top of the proposed restrictions on technology related to producing lithium and gallium.\n\nIf approved, the new additions would form a future round of export controls imposed by China on a slew of critical materials and the technology needed to produce them, which are crucial to manufacturing semiconductors and EV batteries.\n\nAsked about the proposal during a regular press conference on Friday, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said: \u201cWhat we can tell you as a principle is that China implements fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory export control measures.\u201d\n\nThe plan was announced a month after China banned outright the sale of a number of materials crucial for the production of semiconductors and other tech \u2014 including gallium, germanium, antimony and other \u201csuper hard\u201d materials \u2014 to the US. That was in response to fresh export controls on US-made semiconductors imposed by the outgoing Joe Biden administration.\n\nThe latest proposal could be a \u201cresource weaponization\u201d strategy to secure a bargaining chip ahead of Trump\u2019s second term, Liz Lee, an associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNN.\n\nIf implemented, a ban or restriction \u201ccould significantly strengthen (China\u2019s) dominance in the battery ecosystem, especially to boost its supply chain for EV batteries,\u201d she said. \u201cDepending on the level of export controls, it could be problematic for Western lithium producers who want to use Chinese technology to produce lithium, which is one of the core materials for battery cathodes.\u201d\n\nChina dominates the global industry for materials such as gallium, a soft metal commonly used to produce compounds that can make radio frequency chips for mobile phones and satellite communication, and lithium, which is ubiquitous in daily life because it is used to make batteries for everything from smartphones and laptops to EVs.\n\nAdam Webb, head of battery raw materials at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, told Reuters news agency that China\u2019s proposal would help it retain its \u201c70% grip\u201d on the global processing of lithium.\n\n\u201cThese proposed measures would be a move to maintain this high market share and to secure lithium chemical production for China\u2019s domestic battery supply chains,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nA worker transports parts to the assembly line of electric cars at a Leap Motors plant in Jinhua in east China's Zhejiang province on November 26, 2024. Larry Leung/Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nWhile an iPhone needs only a small amount of lithium, an average EV battery needs about eight kilograms (18 pounds) of it. That\u2019s why any new restriction on lithium extraction technology could be particularly important as global demand grows for electric cars. The International Energy Agency says the world is on track to meet only 50% of lithium demand by 2035.\n\nGlobal demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to soar over the next 10 years, McKinsey wrote in 2023, with the number of gigawatt hours required growing from about 700 in 2022 to around 4,700 by 2030.\n\nLee said Chinese policymakers will have to consider the global ambitions of Chinese EV and battery makers when they decide on any restrictions, which could trigger retaliation from the West. EV giant BYD makes its own batteries and is expanding aggressively overseas, while CATL, the world\u2019s biggest battery manufacturer, accounts for 40% of the EV battery market.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the Commerce Ministry added 28 US companies and entities, including major defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, to its export control list for the first time.\n\nThe export control list, which regulates the sale of dual-use technology and is modeled on the US Commerce Department\u2019s \u201cEntity List,\u201d was introduced in November.",

            "text": "AP \u2014\n\nSam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.\n\nPublicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.\n\nMoore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Sam & Dave partner Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nAt the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d\n\nMost of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d\n\nLike many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.\n\nDave Prater, left, and Sam Moore of the band Sam & Dave performs on stage at the Park West in Chicago, on August 28, 1980. Paul Natkin/Getty Images\n\nIn 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.\n\nHe also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.\n\nMoore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.\n\nMoore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities.\n\nEight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMoore was born October 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.\n\nHe and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.\n\nMoore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.\n\nHe married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction that he credited with saving his life.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\u201d during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d\n\nMoore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.\n\nMoore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter and two grandchildren.",

            "title": "New Glenn launch: Blue Origin set to launch its first orbital rocket",
            "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nNearly a quarter century after Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin, the rocket company is poised for its most defining moment to date: sending a vehicle to orbit for the first time.\n\nBlue Origin\u2019s New Glenn rocket is set to make its inaugural launch attempt as soon as 1 a.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. A live stream of the mission is slated to kick off about an hour before liftoff on the social media platform X, Blue Origin\u2019s YouTube channel, and its website, the company said via email.\n\nThe new target launch time was announced after Blue Origin chose to wave off plans to get New Glenn off the ground in the early hours of Sunday morning. The company said weather conditions at sea, where the company hopes to recover part of the rocket after launch, prompted the 24-hour delay.\n\nThe roughly 320-foot (98-meter) New Glenn is not only the first Blue Origin rocket designed to be capable of hauling satellites to space, it\u2019s also among the most powerful in the world. Categorized as a heavy-lift launch vehicle, it packs more than twice the power that SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket gives off during takeoff.\n\nThe uncrewed New Glenn mission will carry Blue Origin-made demonstration technology, called the Blue Ring Pathfinder, to orbit.\n\nIf successful, New Glenn\u2019s launch debut could position Blue Origin to better compete with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u2014 which has long dominated the commercial launch sector.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the New Glenn rocket will fire up seven BE-4 engines at the base of its first-stage rocket booster, which is the largest part of the vehicle that gives the first burst of power at liftoff.\n\nA few minutes into flight, after burning through most of its fuel, the booster will detach from the upper portion of the rocket, which includes the vehicle\u2019s nose cone, or payload fairing, that\u2019s designed to shield cargo during liftoff.\n\nThe booster will then use fins and strakes \u2014 or winglike attachments that flare out from its top and base, respectively \u2014 to help guide itself toward its landing target, a seafaring recovery platform named Jacklyn after Bezos\u2019 mother.\n\nJust before touching down on the platform, the booster will reignite some of its engines and deploy six massive legs to stand on.\n\nA visualization depicts the New Glenn rocket's launch, separation of the first and upper stage, and separation of the nose cone, or payload fairing. The nose cone is a protective shell that shields the cargo. Blue Origin\n\nThe landing maneuver, designed to allow Blue Origin to refurbish and reuse rocket boosters\u2014 much like SpaceX does with its Falcon rockets \u2014 is an attempt to save money and drive down the cost of launches.\n\nMeanwhile, the upper portion of New Glenn, carrying the Blue Ring Pathfinder experiment, will continue toward the cosmos.\n\nTwo engines, optimized to function in the vacuum of space, should fire up and propel the vehicle to speeds necessary to enter orbit \u2014 typically around 17,500 miles per hour, or nearly 23 times the speed of sound.\n\nFor this flight, Blue Origin said it will not deploy a satellite into orbit. Rather, the Blue Ring Pathfinder payload is expected to remain attached to the rocket\u2019s upper stage for the duration of the six-hour mission.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake\n\nSuccess is not guaranteed.\n\nAt any point during the flight, New Glenn could encounter a mission-ending failure. So far, the company has only ignited all seven BE-4 engines at the base of this rocket for 24 seconds during a ground test in late December.\n\nFor this flight, the engines must fire for at least several times that duration as New Glenn attempts to defy Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\n\nIf something goes wrong, and New Glenn begins to fly off its intended course, the company may be forced to implement a self-destruct feature \u2014 blowing the rocket to smithereens so it will not pose a threat to people or property.\n\nThe Blue Ring Pathfinder demonstrator (foreground), is seen with one half of the New Glenn rocket's payload fairing, or nose cone (background), on December 9, 2024. The demo will test technology that will be incoporated in Blue Origin's proposed spacecraft called Blue Ring. Courtesy Blue Origin\n\nBlue Origin could also see success on its primary mission: safely getting the rocket\u2019s second stage and Blue Ring Pathfinder technology into its intended orbit. But even if that objective goes to plan, the company may still fail to land its New Glenn rocket booster on the Jacklyn platform after launch.\n\nFailure to safely land the rocket booster, however, would not make the mission unsuccessful: Recovering rocket parts for reuse is a feat aimed solely at saving Blue Origin money. Most rocket builders, apart from SpaceX, discard that portion of the rocket after launch anyway.\n\nIf and when New Glenn proves it can get the job done, the vehicle is likely to make a big splash in the launch market, said Caleb Henry, the director of research at Quilty Space, which provides data and analysis about the space sector.\n\n\u201cThey are postured so that they can come in and try to fill this role of being the next great, reliable launch provider for the industry,\u201d Henry said.\n\nThe New Glenn is a heavy-lift vehicle, Henry noted, and vehicles of its size and power have \u201cgrown in importance over the years.\u201d\n\nRoughly a decade ago, rocket companies anticipated that small, lightweight rockets would become the next launch phenomenon because they would be capable of rapidly launching satellites intended to flesh out a string of megaconstellations \u2014 or networks of small satellites \u2014 in low-Earth orbit.\n\n\u201cBut two things happened,\u201d Henry said. \u201cFirst is that none of the constellation (operators) went to small rockets. They all went to the medium- or heavy-lift because getting more up in a single mission is faster and more economical than doing this one or two satellites at a time. And then the second is those satellites themselves got bigger.\u201d",

But today\u2019s investigators said they found no evidence that any federal prosecutors ever evaluated those reports.\n\n\u201cIt may be that federal prosecutors considered filing charges and, after consideration, did not do so for reasons that would be understandable if we had a record of the decision,\u201d the report concluded, adding that if the department didn\u2019t seriously consider such charges, \u201cthen its failure to do so is disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe report also examined the role of various people and organizations in the massacre, including the Tulsa Police Department, local sheriff, Oklahoma National Guard and then-Tulsa Mayor T.D. Evans, determining that each played a role in the chaos and destruction, either by failing to act or by actively participating in the attack.\n\nDamario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the last known survivors of the massacre, Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randle, both of whom are 110, did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment on the report. Solomon-Simmons had previously decribed the DOJ\u2019s decision to investigate the massacre as a \u201cjoyous occasion.\u201d\n\nVictor Luckerson, a Black author and historian who wrote a book about Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood district, said there is value in the government establishing a definitive record of the attack.\n\n\u201cHaving government documents available lays the groundwork for the possibility of reparations,\u201d Luckerson said. \u201cAny of those discussions about reparations, one of the first questions is how we establish a factual record of what happened.\u201d\n\nA researcher working for a state commission in 1999 estimated the damage from the attack to be $1.8 million in 1921 dollars, a figure the report said would be about $32.2 million today.\n\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court in June dismissed a lawsuit by survivors, dampening the hope of advocates for racial justice that the city would make financial amends for the attack.\n\nThe nine-member court upheld the decision made by a district court judge in Tulsa last year, ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s grievances about the destruction of the Greenwood district, although legitimate, did not fall within the scope of the state\u2019s public nuisance statute.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nSome of the fastest-growing jobs for 2025 barely existed at the turn of the century, according to a new analysis from LinkedIn.\n\nLinkedIn examined millions of jobs based on user updates from January 2022 to July 2024, determining noticeable growth in the artificial intelligence industry, as well as newfound interest in hospitality and travel.\n\nThe top two jobs were artificial intelligence engineer and artificial intelligence consultant, respectively. Artificial intelligence has become the latest Silicon Valley buzzword as companies like OpenAI have released chatbots that can do everything from hold conversations to suggest recipes to remixing images \u2014 albeit with some occasional high-profile missteps. (Artificial intelligence researcher also nabbed the No. 12 spot.)\n\nBut not all the jobs were AI-focused \u2014 or even high-tech. For example, the No. 3 job was physical therapist. Workforce development manager and travel advisor rounded out the top five.\n\nThe professional social network bills its annual \u201cJobs on the Rise\u201d list as a \u201croadmap\u201d to the future of work. \u201cFrom the rise of AI roles to the resurgence in travel and hospitality positions, the 2025 ranking highlights sectors with sustainable growth in today\u2019s changing workforce,\u201d the company wrote in its post.\n\nMeanwhile, major companies \u2014 including fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s \u2014 have abandoned or downsized their DEI practices, and diversity and inclusion roles don\u2019t seem to be growing as fast as previous years, according to LinkedIn\u2019s report of user updates. From 2018 to 2022, diversity and inclusion managers were the third fastest-growing job title, and from 2019 to 2023, vice president of diversity and inclusion ranked seventh. In the latest report, the roles weren\u2019t in the top 25 at all.\n\nLinkedIn also took note of the gender makeup of the 25 fastest-growing job titles. Of the top 10, security guards (67%), outside sales representatives (81%), artificial intelligence consultants (70%) and engineers (80%) were predominantly male roles.\n\nThe latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, far higher than the 153,000 jobs economists expected. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%, a sign of continued resilience in the labor market.",

WCK, which has been a longstanding partner of their Archewell Foundation, has been distributing free meals to emergency crews and people affected by the massive blazes.\n\nThe pair were also seen hugging Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo, who later described the couple to Fox 11 as \u201cgreat people\u201d who had \u201creally buoyed the spirits.\u201d\n\nGordo said they had been at the center earlier in the day, when they quietly served food and were not recognized because they wore face masks.\n\n\u201cThey want to be as helpful as they can be and really they just wanted to be supportive,\u201d Gordo said.

Hansen this week informing them of the decision.\n\n\u201cOn Oct. 29, 2024, during Game 4 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, you interfered with play by intentionally and forcefully grabbing a player. Your conduct posed a serious risk to the health and safety of the player and went far over the line of acceptable fan behavior,\u201d said the letter, the contents of which were first reported by the New York Post and later obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cBased on your conduct, Major League Baseball is banning you indefinitely from all MLB stadiums, offices, and other facilities,\u201d the letter said. \u201cYou are also hereby banned indefinitely from attending any events sponsored by or associated with MLB. Please be advised that if you are discovered at any MLB property or event, you will be removed from the premises and subject to arrest for trespass.\u201d\n\nMLB has previously issued league-wide bans for fans who trespass on the field or threaten baseball personnel.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFour lynx \u201cillegally released\u201d into the Scottish Highlands have been captured by park rangers in a rollercoaster two-day rescue effort.\n\nThe search began on Wednesday afternoon when two lynx were spotted in the Cairngorms National Park, one of the last truly wild places remaining in the UK. The animals were captured the following day, lured with bait into humane traps.\n\nTwo additional lynx, which appeared to have been \u201cdeliberately abandoned,\u201d were later spotted on camera traps Thursday night in the same region, according to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).\n\nOne of the lynx has since died, RZSS told CNN Saturday.\n\nThe 48-hour rescue effort was initially declared a victory by conservation groups, but the discovery of the medium-sized cats \u2013 which once roamed free in Scotland \u2013 has sparked fears that some might be taking rewildling into their own hands.\n\nLynx tend to ignore humans and don\u2019t generally pose a threat, according to wildlife experts. Some conservationists have called for the lynx to be released back into the Scottish Highlands, but reintroducing the lost species has long been a thorny issue.\n\nDavid Field, chief executive of RZSS, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program that there are \u201crogue rewilders out there\u201d who ignore international best practice with regard to the reintroduction of species.\n\n\u201cThey are impatient and then proceed in a way which is this rebellious rogue rewilding. That\u2019s really sad and that\u2019s a real, real risk,\u201d he said.\n\nConservationists have condemned the release, saying that the animals -- photographed in Scotland -- would be unlikely to survive in the wild. Royal Zoological Society of Scotland\n\nEdward Mountain, Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said the second lynx capture \u201cwould suggest a concerted approach to illegally reintroduce lynx,\u201d according to PA Media.\n\nPolice Scotland and rangers from the Cairngorms National Park Authority joined the mammoth rescue effort and inquiries are being made into how the animals ended up roaming free in the park.\n\nThe second pair of cats were captured at around 6:30 p.m. local time on January 10 within the Kingussie region of the park and taken to the nearby Highland Wildlife Park to be assessed by vets, RZSS said.\n\nThe cats will be moved into quarantine for 30 days at Edinburgh Zoo, RZSS added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster 48 hours, with people working throughout the day and night, in some extremely challenging conditions,\u201d Dr Helen Senn, RZSS Head of Conservation said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nSenn added that they don\u2019t think there are any more lynx in the park but will continue to monitor the release site.\n\nHighland Wildlife Park said in a statement on Facebook that they \u201ccondemn the illegal release of these lynx in the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very unlikely they would have survived in the wild,\u201d the park added.",
